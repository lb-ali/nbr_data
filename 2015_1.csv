												The Houston Rockets (3-0) escaped with a 130-128 win over the Dallas Mavericks (0-3). Monta Ellis missed the game-tying 19-foot jumper just before the buzzer sounded. This performance marks the first time since 1994 a team scoring at least 128 points in a non-overtime playoff game didn’t come away with the win.MVP candidate James Harden hit the game-clinching jumper over the Mavericks’ Tyson Chandler with 12 seconds remaining. The bucket gave him a playoff career-high 42 points to go along with nine assists, five rebounds, one steal and five three-pointers in 36 minutes. Dwight Howard played 38 minutes and grabbed 26 rebounds, more than half the team’s 46 boards. He was one of five players on the Rockets not names James Harden to score at least 12 points, a unit led by Josh Smith’s 18 points in 27 minutes off the bench.Without Rajon Rondo and Chandler Parsons, both done for the rest of the postseason, the Mavericks held firm with a combined 68 points from Monta Ellis and Dirk Nowitzki. Ellis recorded playoff career-highs of 34 points and nine assists in 39 minutes. Nowitzki pulled the Mavericks to within one with 33 seconds left by converting three free throws, but it wasn’t enough. Raymond Felton started for the ailing Rondo, but he was held scoreless in 13 minutes with the team deferring to Ellis as the primary ballhandler. J.J. Barea and Devin Harris combined for 21 points and 11 assists off the bench. After converting 91 percent of their free throws in the first two contests, the Mavericks sank 27-of-35 from the charity stripe.The series resumes Sunday night. A Rockets’ win in Dallas eliminated the Mavericks from the playoffs.

												The Washington Wizards (3-0) inched one game closer to advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinal round with a 106-99 victory over the Toronto Raptors (0-3). After taking a 35-33 lead going into the second quarter, the Raptors were held to 13 points in the second frame.For the second straight postseason, Paul Pierce haunted the Raptors with another clutch shot. This time, Pierce hit a game-clinching three-pointer to give the Wizards a six-point lead with 16 seconds left. He scored 11 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, going 3-of-3 from downtown and hitting both free throws. John Wall followed up 17 assists the previous game with 15 assists in 42 minutes. Marcin Gortat was responsible for eight of Wall’s assists, notching a team-high 24 points, 13 rebounds, five assists and four blocks in 42 minutes. He helped the Wizards record 13 blocks. Otto Porter contributed 11 points and eight rebounds off the bench as coach Randy Wittman continues to utilize Pierce as the nominal power forward.Amir Johnson replaced Tyler Hansbrough in the starting lineup and recorded a double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds in 33 minutes. Even though DeMar DeRozan shot 11-of-29 from the floor, he scored a playoff career-high 32 points to go along with six rebounds, six assists, one steal and three three-pointers in 41 minutes. He tallied a Raptors’ franchise record 20 points in the first quarter, only to conclude the final three quarters a woeful 3-of-18 shooting. Battling an illness and a shin contusion, All-Star Kyle Lowry converted 5-of-22 field goal attempts to score 15 points in 38 minutes. To round out the futility, Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams was held to seven points on 3-of-11 from the field in 18 minutes.The series continues on Sunday night. A Wizards’ win advances them to the second round of the postseason while eliminating the Raptors from the playoffs.

												The San Antonio Spurs (2-1) rolled to a 100-73 win over the Los Angeles Clippers (1-2).Kawhi Leonard began the night accepting his Defensive Player of the Year award, and then added offensive maestro to his repertoire before the end of the third quarter. He scored a career-high 32 points in 29 minutes and hounded the Clippers’ Blake Griffin on the defensive end. Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili all combined for 12 points in the lopsided victory. On the eve of his 39th birthday, Duncan was the only Spur to play more than 30 minutes, noteworthy because he played 44 minutes in Game 2. After being ruled out prior to the game with an ankle injury, Aron Baynes surprisingly played the final seven minutes.The Clippers set franchise playoff record-lows with 73 points, 34 percent field goal accuracy, and a playoff-worse 27-point loss. The league’s best regular season offense on a possession basis was limited to 11 third-quarter points, concluding the first three periods with 49 points. Blake Griffin finished the game with team-highs of 14 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and 15 shot attempts, nearly recording his second straight triple-double. Chris Paul, the league’s steadiest ballhandler, registered six turnovers in 33 minutes and shot 3-of-11 from the floor. J.J. Redick scored all seven of his points in the first quarter, and Jamal Crawford was held to 1-of-11 shooting. Austin Rivers finished second on the team in scoring with 11 points, most of which were recorded in garbage time.Both teams resume the series Sunday afternoon in the AT&T Center. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Los Angeles,Clippers,AT&T Center,56,26,55,27,10.0,24.0,36.0,70.0,8.0,11.0,41.0,23.0,11.0,5.0,20.0,26.0,76.0,9.0,12.0,35.0,12.0,14.0,Kawhi Leonard,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,32.0,13.0,18.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,28,Matt Barnes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,20,Tim Duncan,7.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Blake Griffin,10.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,Tiago Splitter,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,DeAndre Jordan,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Danny Green,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,29,JJ Redick,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,31,Tony Parker,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,25,Chris Paul,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,33,Boris Diaw,6.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Hedo Turkoglu,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,8,Patty Mills,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,14,Austin Rivers,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,22,Manu Ginobili,6.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Jamal Crawford,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,23,Marco Belinelli,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15,Dahntay Jones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Matt Bonner,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,15,Glen Davis,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (3-0) defeated the Boston Celtics (0-3), 103-95, Thursday at the TD Garden to take a 3-0 lead in their series.Boston looked to change its fortunes in Game 3 on its home court after dropping the first two games of the series in Cleveland. The Celtics hung close throughout the game and when Evan Turner, who had his best game of the series, hit a three to cut the Cavaliers' lead to three with 2:45 remaining, it looked as though tide was turning in Boston's favor. Cleveland extinguished that momentum almost immediately as Kevin Love drained a corner three on the next possession to put the Cavaliers back up by six. Love had his best game of the postseason with 23 points and nine rebounds, including two big-time three pointers in the fourth quarter. Boston will look to avoid the sweep on Sunday when it hosts Cleveland for Game 4. Cleveland not only had a big night from Kevin Love, but also a classic playoff performance from LeBron James. The superstar James finished with 31 points, 11 rebounds, four steals, and two blocks to lead the Cavaliers. One of the unsung heroes for Cleveland was reserve forward Tristan Thompson, who had 12 points and seven rebounds over 28 minutes off the bench. Thompson's five offensive rebounds allowed Cleveland to retain possession at key moments down the stretch to let the Cavaliers to run out the clock. The Cavaliers will look to finish out the series Sunday in Boston. Boston's ability to hang close with Cleveland was made all the more impressive by the fact that it's best scorer, Isaiah Thomas, was a non-factor for most of the game. Thomas, who had scored 22 points in each of Boston's first two games of the postseason, was held to just five points on 2-of-9 shooting. To offset Thomas' quiet night off the bench, Jae Crowder made a lot of noise in his 31 minutes on the floor. Crowder was all over the court, forcing jump balls, nabbing two steals, and blocking four shots to go with seven rebounds and 16 points. The Celtics will need a similar performance from Crowder in Game 4, as well as a bigger outing from Thomas, in order to extend the series on Sunday.  ",Boston,Celtics,Cleveland,Cavaliers,TD Garden,53,29,40,42,5.0,19.0,36.0,82.0,18.0,21.0,45.0,19.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,Evan Turner,8.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,33,LeBron James,11.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,31.0,13.0,26.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,41,Brandon Bass,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Kevin Love,9.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,37,Tyler Zeller,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Timofey Mozgov,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,19,Avery Bradley,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,18.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,32,JR Smith,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,38,Marcus Smart,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,17,Kyrie Irving,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,3.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,39,Jared Sullinger,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,16,Tristan Thompson,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Isaiah Thomas,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,21,Iman Shumpert,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,20,Jae Crowder,7.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,16.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,30,Matthew Dellavedova,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,10,Gigi Datome,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9,James Jones,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Jonas Jerebko,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,25,Brendan Haywood,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Chicago Bulls (3-0) outlasted the Milwaukee Bucks (0-3) in double overtime Thursday, 113-106, at the BMO Harris Bradley Center.  The Bucks had a .6% win probability with 2:00 minutes remaining in the fourth as they trailed by eight points. Milwaukee didn't look like the team that had an 18-point lead earlier in the game as Derrick Rose and Tony Snell had started to take over for Chicago. The Bucks turned to Khris Middleton, who scored eight of Milwaukee's final nine points to force overtime. After the Bulls and Bucks traded baskets in the first overtime period, the Bulls' began to pull away in the second overtime. Milwaukee's offense sputtered out and began turning the ball over at an alarming rate, failing to register its first point of the second overtime until the final minute. Derrick Rose delivered a huge performance to lead the Bulls to victory with 34 points and eight assists over 48 minutes. The Bulls will look to close out the series Saturday in Milwaukee. Chicago survived Milwaukee's massive momentum towards the end of regulation to gain a three-game advantage in this best of seven series. Along with Rose's tremendous effort, Pau Gasol turned in another double-double with 17 points and 14 rebounds. Tony Snell was key off the bench with 16 points, nine of which came on three three pointers in the fourth quarter. The Bulls are now poised to take a series sweep over the Bucks, but if Thursday's game is any indication, they will be in for a battle in Game 4. Milwaukee's young nucleus turned in a strong performance Thursday against a more battle tested Chicago club. Giannis Antetokounmpo started off strong with 17 first half points and finished with 25 to go with 12 rebounds over 51 minutes on the floor. John Henson had a huge game off the bench with 15 points, 14 rebounds, and three blocks as he filled in ably for a struggling Zaza Pachulia. The Bucks will look to extend the series Saturday on their home floor and avoid a sweep against their division rival.    ",Milwaukee,Bucks,Chicago,Bulls,Fiserv Forum,50,32,41,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Giannis Antetokounmpo,12.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,25.0,10.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,51,Mike Dunleavy,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,29,Ersan Ilyasova,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22,Pau Gasol,14.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,17.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,41,Zaza Pachulia,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Joakim Noah,12.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,45,Khris Middleton,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,17.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,48,Jimmy Butler,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,24.0,8.0,20.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,53,Michael Carter-Williams,4.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,9.0,21.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,43,Derrick Rose,5.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,34.0,12.0,23.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,48,John Henson,14.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,38,Tony Snell,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,26,Jared Dudley,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,20,Taj Gibson,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,O.J.

												The Golden State Warriors (3-0) mounted a historic comeback to defeat the New Orleans Pelicans (0-3), 123-119 in overtime Thursday at the Smoothie King Center. In a game New Orleans needed to win to avoid a 0-3 deficit in its series with Golden State, the Pelicans looked to be on their way to delivering a victory in front of the home crowd. The Pelicans took a 20-point lead into the fourth quarter, but the Warriors remained composed and began chipping into the deficit. Golden State's Draymond Green, who got into foul trouble early, helped give the Warriors life with four offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter. That ability to extend possessions keyed Golden State's comeback as the lead was cut to five with under a minute remaining. What was once an relaxed crowd at the Smoothie King Center turned tense with every missed shot by the Pelicans and every made basket by the Warriors. With time winding down and the Warriors down by just three points after an Anthony Davis missed free throw, Stephen Curry buried an unbelievable three pointer from the corner to send it to overtime. Curry then opened overtime with another three. Golden State took a six point lead, but New Orleans' Ryan Anderson drained a three of his own to cut the lead to one. The Pelicans had one last good chance to tie the game late, but Anthony Davis' layup attempt didn't fall as Golden State finished one of the biggest comebacks in playoff history. The Pelicans will look to extend the series in Game 4 on Saturday.  Golden State's unbelievable comeback was highlighted by Curry's 40 points, but second chance points laid the foundation. Draymond Green, who is all of 6-foot-7, finished with seven offensive rebounds and 17 boards overall before fouling out in overtime. The Warriors had 16 second-chance points in the fourth quarter and overtime and 30 second-chance points overall to help complete the comeback. The Warriors became the third team ever to rally from a 20-point deficit in the fourth quarter of a playoff game to win, according to ESPN Stats & Info. Golden State will look to complete the sweep Saturday at the Smoothie King Center. New Orleans' fourth quarter collapse puts it in a tough position to get back into the series. Anthony Davis was dominant for much of the game, scoring 29 points to go with 15 rebounds over 46 minutes. He only managed six points in the fourth quarter and overtime, however. The Pelicans got major contributions from their bench, namely 26 points from Ryan Anderson and 16 points from Norris Cole. Jrue Holiday returned from a one game absence to finish with 10 points in 17 minutes off the bench as well. The Pelicans will have to shake off Thursday's loss in order to avoid the sweep Saturday. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Golden State,Warriors,Smoothie King Center,67,15,45,37,,,,,,,,,,14.0,41.0,42.0,104.0,25.0,30.0,51.0,24.0,10.0,Quincy Pondexter,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,34,Harrison Barnes,7.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,37,Anthony Davis,15.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,29.0,11.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,46,Draymond Green,17.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,40,Omer Asik,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Andrew Bogut,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Eric Gordon,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,34,Klay Thompson,6.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,28.0,9.0,21.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,45,Tyreke Evans,4.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,18.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,39,Stephen Curry,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,40.0,10.0,29.0,7.0,18.0,3.0,43,Ryan Anderson,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,10.0,14.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,30,Andre Iguodala,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,26,Norris Cole,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,25,Leandro Barbosa,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,11,Jrue Holiday,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Festus Ezeli,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Dante Cunningham,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Marreese Speights,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Alexis Ajinca,,,,,,,,,,,,Shaun Livingston,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20

												The Atlanta Hawks (60-22) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (38-44) 96-91 to take a 2-0 lead in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs on Wednesday.Al Horford had a big game and led his team with 13 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks to go along with 14 points. He wasn't the only one showing off his passing skills, as he was one of four Hawk's players to record five or more assists on the night. Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver combined for 36 points to fortify the Atlanta scoring attack, and also hit seven three-pointers. Dennis Schroder had a solid performance off the bench, he had 12 points, six assists and two steals in 19 minutes. He's now averaging 12.5 points, 4.0 assists and 1.5 steals in the series. The Hawks will try and take a 3-0 lead when they take on the Nets in game three on Saturday.The Nets nearly came back from a 10-point, fourth quarter deficit, but couldn't quite get over the hump as the Hawks were able to knock down four of their final six free throws with under :30 remaining. Brooklyn had a hard time staying hot on offense as Thaddeus Young and Deron Williams each went 1-for-7 from the field for a combined four points. Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez and Jarrett Jack were forced to carry the scoring load. They combined for 62 points but Brooklyn still fell short of tying up the series at one game a piece. The Nets will try and take game three against the Hawks in Brooklyn on Saturday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Brooklyn,Nets,State Farm Arena,38,44,60,22,12.0,31.0,35.0,90.0,14.0,19.0,41.0,27.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,DeMarre Carroll,8.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,33,Joe Johnson,9.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,16.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,39,Paul Millsap,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,19.0,7.0,11.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,34,Thaddeus Young,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,23,Al Horford,13.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Brook Lopez,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,20.0,8.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,39,Kyle Korver,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,17.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,36,Bojan Bogdanovic,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,33,Jeff Teague,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,16.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,31,Deron Williams,10.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,28,Pero Antic,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13,Mirza Teletovic,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3,Kent Bazemore,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,16,Alan Anderson,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,29,Dennis Schroder,0.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,19,Jarrett Jack,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,13.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,28,Mike Scott,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,12,Mason Plumlee,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Shelvin Mack,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Markel Brown,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Memphis Grizzlies (55-27) took a 2-0 lead when they defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (51-31) 97-82 on Wednesday.Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol went just 9-for-31 from the floor combined, yet the Grizzlies still managed to win game two of the series, with ease. They found other ways to get it done on the floor, as Randolph grabbed ten rebounds and Gasol recorded three blocks and five assists. It didn't hurt that they turned the ball over just five times and took incredible care of the basketball throughout the game. Point guards Mike Conley and Beno Udrih turned the ball over just twice in 48 minutes combined. The Grizzlies top bench performer was Jeff Green who had a plus-20 in the plus/minus statistic and finished with nine points, five rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block in 27 minutes. In this series he's averaging 10.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in 28 minutes a game. He'll try and continue to lead the Memphis bench attack again on Saturday in game three from Portland.LaMarcus Aldridge had 15 points and 10 rebounds at half time with his team down 50-39. He wasn't able to keep up the pace and his team wasn't able to mount a comeback, and now they'll head back to Portland without a victory thus far in the series. Aldridge still put up a great all-around game with 24 points, 14 rebounds, four blocks and two steals, but he and Nicolas Batum each had four costly turnovers that the Trail Blazers paid for them in the end. Damian Lillard couldn't quite get it going on offense, as he scored 18 points on 5-for-16 shooting with seven points coming from the free throw line. He also only managed to dish out one assist from the point guard position in 40 minutes, after recording just three as in game one. The Blazers will try and take game three at home in Portland on Saturday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (55-27) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (56-26) 111-107 in overtime of game three of the Western Conference playoffs on Wednesday.The Spurs have no problem implementing Hack-A-Shaq if they aren't confident in an opposing player's ability to hit free throws. So it was no surprise that DeAndre Jordan, a career 42 percent free throw shooter, shot 17 free throws before the end of regulation in game two. Despite knocking down just six of his attempts, the Clippers were able to come back and force overtime, after being down by ten in the fourth quarter. The game was tied at 92 with under a minute to play when Patty Mills fouled Chris Paul and Paul knocked down two free throws to put the Clippers up 94-92. Paul then fouled Mills on the other end and Mills returned the favor and put in two free throws of his own.With the victory San Antonio wil now head home with a 1-1 series in their favor in terms of home court advantage. This series between the Clippers and Spurs is the now the only one that a sweep is no longer a possibility, now that two games have been completed in each matchup. Tim Duncan followed up a disappointing game one with 28 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and two steals. Blake Griffin and J.J. Reddick won the battle of minutes in this iron man match, they each played a game-high 47. Griffin recorded a triple-double with 29 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists. He also had five turnovers. The Spurs as a team only had nine. Reddick went 4-for-9 from long distance and finished with 16 points. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,San Antonio,Spurs,Staples Center,55,27,56,26,9.0,29.0,39.0,92.0,20.0,37.0,55.0,23.0,11.0,8.0,24.0,42.0,89.0,19.0,26.0,47.0,26.0,9.0,Matt Barnes,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,10.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,35,Tim Duncan,11.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,28.0,14.0,23.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,44,Blake Griffin,12.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,12.0,25.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,46,Kawhi Leonard,9.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,9.0,16.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,39,DeAndre Jordan,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,20.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,44,Tiago Splitter,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,JJ Redick,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,47,Danny Green,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,29,Chris Paul,8.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,43,Tony Parker,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Jamal Crawford,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,21,Boris Diaw,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,37,Glen Davis,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Manu Ginobili,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,22,Austin Rivers,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Patty Mills,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,19,Hedo Turkoglu,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Marco Belinelli,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,18,Dahntay Jones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Cory Joseph,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (2-0) took a 2-0 lead in their opening round series with the Boston Celtics (0-2) on Tuesday with a 99-91 victory at the Quicken Loans Arena. Unlike in Game 1 where Boston couldn't hang with Cleveland for all 48 minutes, the Celtics hung close with the Cavaliers for the entirety of Tuesday's Game 2. The Celtics had a chance to cut the Cavaliers' lead to four with just under two minutes remaining, but Tyler Zeller's jumper was blocked by LeBron James. Cleveland proceeded to run the clock down thanks to some timely offensive rebounding from Tristan Thompson. LeBron James finished with 30 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. During the game, James passed Jerry West for 7th on the all-time postseason scoring list. The series will head to Boston for Game 3 on Thursday, where Boston will look to avoid a nearly insurmountable 3-0 deficit. Boston battled throughout, but was ultimately unable to steal a game on the road. Isaiah Thomas was an offensive catalyst off the bench with 22 points to lead the team in scoring. Thomas also managed to get to the line with some frequency, going 10-for-10 from the charity stripe. The only other Celtic with more than two free throw attempts was Evan Turner, who was 3-of-4. There were some positives on the defensive end for Boston, however, as it forced 18 turnovers and held Cleveland to 24 percent from beyond the arc. If Boston can match that effort again on the defensive end in Game 3, it will give the Celtics a shot to extend the series to at least Game 5. Cleveland's stars were the story once again as LeBron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 56 of the Cavaliers' 99 points. That said, Tristan Thompson's impact off the bench cannot be understated. Thompson finished with 11 rebounds, with six of those boards coming on the offensive end. Timofey Mozgov was also effective before fouling out with 16 points, seven rebounds, and five blocks. The Cavaliers will look to take a commanding 3-0 lead in the series Thursday in Boston. 											",Cleveland,Cavaliers,Boston,Celtics,Quicken Loans Arena,40,42,53,29,7.0,29.0,34.0,76.0,24.0,26.0,47.0,18.0,18.0,6.0,22.0,33.0,85.0,19.0,22.0,39.0,19.0,11.0,LeBron James,9.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,30.0,11.0,22.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,41,Evan Turner,12.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,33,Kevin Love,6.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,29,Brandon Bass,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Timofey Mozgov,7.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,16.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,28,Tyler Zeller,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,JR Smith,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,34,Avery Bradley,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,28,Kyrie Irving,5.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,8.0,18.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,38,Marcus Smart,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,25,Tristan Thompson,11.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Isaiah Thomas,1.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,30,Kendrick Perkins,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Jared Sullinger,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,22,Iman Shumpert,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25,Kelly Olynyk,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,20,Matthew Dellavedova,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9,Jae Crowder,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,29,James Jones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4,Jonas Jerebko,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4

												The Washington Wizards (2-0) defeated the Toronto Raptors (0-2), 117-106, on Tuesday at the Air Canada Centre. The Wizards are the only team with a road win so far in this year's postseason and now have a commanding 2-0 lead as the series heads back to Washington for Game 3. Washington's John Wall put together a stellar performance in Game 2 with 26 points and 17 assists. The Raptors trailed by double digits at the half, but cut the Wizards' lead to just two points early in the third quarter. The Wizards responded by outscoring the Raptors 34-14 for the rest of the quarter to build a commanding lead. Toronto began to cut into the lead, but had trouble getting stops and were stuck trading baskets with Washington down the stretch. The Wizards have a chance to take a 3-0 advantage in the series on Friday in front of their home crowd. Washington flipped the script from Game 1's defensive oriented win to light up the scoreboard in Game 2 to the tune of 117 points. The Wizards boosted their field goal percentage from 39.4 in Game 1 to 53.2 in Game 2. In addition to Wall's big outing, Bradley Beal was on fire with 28 points on 12-for-21 shooting. The Wizards are now positioned to close out this best of game series on their home floor with Games 3 and 4 at the Verizon Center. Toronto will have an uphill climb to get back into this series after dropping its first two games at home. That uphill climb is made tougher by the fact that star point guard Kyle Lowry is clearly less than 100 percent. Lowry finished with six points on 3-of-10 shooting in 27 minutes on the floor and did not play in the final 5:56. He appeared to suffer a foot injury in the fourth and was hindered by a number of injuries down over the last month of the regular season. The bright spots for the Raptors were DeMar Derozan and Sixth Man of the Year Louis Williams scoring 20 points apiece. The Raptors now face a must-win game Friday in Washington.  											",Toronto,Raptors,Washington,Wizards,Scotiabank Arena,46,36,49,33,7.0,18.0,39.0,80.0,21.0,32.0,28.0,19.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,Terrence Ross,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,24,Paul Pierce,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,27,Tyler Hansbrough,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Nene,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Jonas Valanciunas,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Marcin Gortat,8.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,16.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,DeMar DeRozan,4.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,40,Bradley Beal,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,12.0,21.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,42,Kyle Lowry,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,27,John Wall,1.0,17.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,8.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,39,Patrick Patterson,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,25,Drew Gooden,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,18,Greivis Vasquez,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,27,Otto Porter Jr.,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,34,Lou Williams,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,20.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,26,Ramon Sessions,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,14,Amir Johnson,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Kevin Seraphin,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,James Johnson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Rasual Butler,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Houston Rockets (2-0) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (0-2), 111-99, in Game 2 on Tuesday at the Toyota Center. The Rockets had several opportunities to pull away throughout the game, but Dallas always seemed to find an answer. That is, until the fourth quarter, when Dallas stopped being able to counter Houston's haymakers. The Rockets were able to space the floor and find open cutters throughout the fourth, which led to them outscoring the Mavericks 30-19 to close out the game. Josh Smith led the charge in the fourth with his passing as he dished out seven assists, including a couple alley-oops, in the final period. Smith matched his playoff career-high for assists with nine and also added 15 points and eight rebounds to help Houston hold serve on its home court. The series will transition to Dallas on Friday for Game 3. Dallas was short-handed coming into Game 2 with Chandler Parsons (knee) and Devin Harris (toe) sidelined, but things were made worse by Rajon Rondo's unimpactful outing. In just 10 minutes on the floor, Rondo picked up four fouls, including a technical foul, and four points before being replaced by a combination of J.J Barea and Raymond Felton. Coach Rick Carlisle said after the game that it was his decision to hold Rondo out of the game after picking up four fouls. Dirk Nowitzki finished with just 10 points on an uncharacteristically poor 3-of-14 shooting performance. Al-Farouq Aminu provided a spark off the bench on the defensive end with two steals and three blocks. The Mavericks will look to get back into the series Friday on their home floor. Houston looks to be a more formidable team now that Dwight Howard has gotten back into a rhythm. Howard played 33 minutes Tuesday and led the Rockets with 28 points while also adding 12 rebounds and two blocks. A healthy Howard helps alleviate some of the scoring pressure on MVP Candidate James Harden, who hit all of his 13 free throws en route to scoring 24 in the game. The Rockets have a chance to take a commanding 3-0 lead in the series Friday in Dallas.   											",Houston,Rockets,Dallas,Mavericks,Toyota Center,50,32,56,26,6.0,20.0,39.0,88.0,27.0,35.0,49.0,25.0,11.0,6.0,22.0,33.0,88.0,27.0,28.0,45.0,14.0,8.0,Trevor Ariza,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,35,Richard Jefferson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,22,Terrence Jones,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22,Dirk Nowitzki,13.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,37,Dwight Howard,12.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,28.0,10.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Tyson Chandler,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,11.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,James Harden,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,5.0,17.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,34,Monta Ellis,5.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,24.0,8.0,23.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,37,Jason Terry,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,23,Rajon Rondo,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,Clint Capela,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,J.J.

												The Chicago Bulls (2-0) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (0-2) 91-82 on Monday at the United center in Chicago in game two of their first round matchup of the Eastern Conference playoffs.In a chippy game featuring seven technical fouls and an ejection (Zaza Pachulia), the Bulls were able to have a big fourth quarter to pull out the nine-point win and grab a two-game lead in the series. The Bucks had a strong defensive effort in the first half, forcing the Bulls into 11 turnovers before the break, but they were unable to get anything going offensively and the Bulls took a one-point lead into the half. It was the fourth quarter where the Bulls took the advantage though, as they went on a 13-0 run with six minutes left in the game to put them up 10 fueled by Jimmy Butler, who was nearly unstoppable in this outing.Including that huge final quarter, Butler finished with a game-high of 31 points (10-19 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 8-14 FT), while adding nine rebounds and two assists over 46 minutes. Butler got into a shoving match with OJ Mayo earlier in the second quarter which led to a few technicals, but that really seemed to fuel his intensity and he never looked back. Derrick Rose struggled mightily in the first half, going scoreless on 0-for-7 shooting from the field. He clearly made some adjustments at half though and salvaged his performance with 15 points (4-14 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 5-5 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. Helping to give the Bulls an impressive 64-48 rebounding advantage was the duo of Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah, who combined to record 35 of the team's 64 rebounds. Gasol finished with 11 points (4-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-6 FT), 16 rebounds and four blocked shots, while Noah added six points (3-9 FG), 19 rebounds and five assists. After Nikola Mirotic went to the floor and got into a tussle with Zaza Pachulia, he had to leave with a knee injury, but it's unclear how that will affect his status moving forward.Khris Middleton did everything he could to keep the Bucks close. He went into the half leading all scorers with 12 points and then went on to score a team-high of 22 points (8-20 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT), to go along with six rebounds and a steal over 38 minutes. Middleton had 18 points in game one on Saturday as well, but he just hasn't gotten enough scoring help to stay even with the Bulls. The only other Buck in double-digit points was Michael Carter-Williams, who posted 12 points (5-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT), five rebounds and two assists. Both Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ersan Ilyasova struggled with their shots. They combined to shoot a meager 5-for-21 from the field and 0-for-3 from the three-point line for 14 points. Antetokounmpo added 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots, but it just wasn't enough in the end. Despite forcing the Bulls into 15 total turnovers, while committing just four of their own, the Bucks just couldn't establish enough of an offensive presence to keep up in the end.These two teams will now head to Milwaukee for game three of the series on Thursday.

												The Golden State Warriors (2-0) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (0-2) 97-87 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland in game two of their first round matchup of the Western Conference playoffs.The Pelicans got off to a really quick start in this game, out-scoring the Warriors 28-17 in the first quarter, as both Anthony Davis and Eric Gordon finished the quarter in double figures. The Warriors then got a huge spark off the bench in the second quarter from Leandro Barbosa, who scored 10 of his 12 points during that span, helping get the Warriors to a three-point lead at the break. After a tight third quarter, the Warriors finally broke out in the fourth, as Klay Thompson got hot and scored 14 points in the final quarter to help push the Warriors to the 10-point win and give them the two game advantage in the series.Including scoring 14 in the fourth quarter, Klay Thompson finished the game with a team-high of 26 points, as he shot 11-for-17 from the field and 3-for-9 from deep. With Curry playing so well early on, Thompson didn't have to do much in the first half, but he really turned it on near the end of the game with a clutch performance in front of an electrifying crowd at Oracle Arena. Curry, on the other hand, posted 22 points (9-21 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 1-1 FT), four rebounds and six assists over 37 minutes. He didn't score at all in the fourth quarter, but he didn't need to with Thompson's emergence. Another player that came up huge for the Warriors was Draymond Green, who time after time made the big play to get the Warriors their momentum back. He notched a double-double and did a little bit of everything in the win, finishing with 14 points (4-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT), 12 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocked shots. Andrew Bogut chipped in with 14 rebounds as well, helping give the Warriors a 49-42 rebounding advantage.Along with helping the Pelicans get the strong start, both Davis and Gordon ended up as the team leaders in scoring. Davis recorded 26 points (9-22 FG, 8-8 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots, while Gordon added 23 points (9-19 FG, 5-10 3Pt) and two assists. Davis was having his way with the Warriors' frontcourt early, but they stepped it up in the second half and held him in check. After feeling a pop in his left knee during game one of this series on Saturday, Tyreke Evans had to leave that game and he never returned. Evans was back in the lineup Monday though and the injury didn't look to hold him back, as he finished with 16 points (4-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 7-12 FT), 10 rebounds and seven assists in a near triple-double effort. If the Pelicans want to get over the hump and come out with a victory in this series, Evans will need to step it up even more in game three. Norris Cole provided a nice contribution off the bench as well, scoring 11 points (5-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 0-1 FT) in 27 minutes. Cole was really the only bench production for the Pelicans though, as the Warriors' bench was much more effective Monday.  These two teams will now head to New Orleans to play game three of the series on Thursday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (53-29) defeated the Boston Celtics (40-42) 113-100 on Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena in their first meeting of the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs.It was the Kyrie Irving show on Sunday, as he hit shot after shot in his NBA playoffs debut. Not only was he hitting shots, but he was making all the tough ones as well, including a three-pointer with a hand in his face at the buzzer to end the first half, putting the Cavaliers up 62-54 at the break. Irving went 11-for-21 from the field and 5-for-9 from the three-point line to finish with a game-high of 30 points, while also adding three rebounds and two assists. His performance erased any doubts of how he'll play during his first trip to the NBA playoffs. As a team, the Cavaliers shot 45 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Celtics finished at 47 percent from the floor and 36 percent from deep.Irving received a ton of help from the other two members of the ""Big Three"", as both LeBron James and Kevin Love had strong showings. Like Irving, this also marked Love's NBA playoff debut and he made it count with 19 points (5-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and 12 rebounds. His 12 rebounds helped give the Cavaliers a 46-34 rebounding advantage over the Celtics. James, on the other hand, finished with 20 points (8-18 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) of his own, to go along with six rebounds, seven assists and two steals. James didn't have to take this game over like he has in years past due to the impressive performance from Irving. With Irving having such a big game, James was able to focus on getting his teammates involved, as his seven assists were a team-high. The Cavaliers also received a solid contribution from their bench, as Tristan Thompson chipped in with 12 points (4-6 FG, 4-6 FT) and six rebounds in 26 minutes of tough play.    Like he's done ever since joining the Celtics, Isaiah Thomas was again the most productive player for Boston. Thomas went 6-for-14 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 22 points, while also adding five rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes off the bench. Thomas hadn't posted double figure assists even once previously this season, so the double-double was a very nice surprise for this team, despite taking the loss. Thomas will need to continue to play like this if the Celtics want any chance in this series, but he'll need to get more production from others, as he didn't get much help Sunday. Kelly Olynyk did everything he could to help Thomas and had a strong first half, but slowed down in the second to finish with 12 points (5-7 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and two blocked shots off the bench. Both Evan Turner and Brandon Bass reached double figures in points as well. Turner finished with 12 points (4-12 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-3 FT), seven rebounds and five assists, while Bass added 10 points (3-6 FG, 4-4 FT) and two assists.The Celtics came out in the first quarter playing extremely hard and looking like the more motivated team, but they weren't able to hold off the more talented and experienced Cavaliers, who eventually got into a groove and were just too much for the Celtics.These two teams will play again on Tuesday in Cleveland.

												The Atlanta Hawks (61-22) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (38-45) 99-92 on Sunday at Philips Arena in Atlanta in their first matchup of the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs.After coming out of the first quarter with a 12-point lead, the Hawks looked as if they were about to run the Nets right out of the gym and coast to an easy victory. The Nets had something to say about that though, as they eventually went on a nine-point run with eight minutes left in the third quarter to bring it back within three. The Hawks then went on a run of their own, regaining a solid lead over the Nets. The Nets brought it to within four points again with just under two minutes left in the final quarter, but the Hawks proved to be just too much and held on to a seven-point victory despite a strong effort from Brooklyn. The Hawks shot 43 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets went 46 percent from the floor and 25 percent from deep.Kyle Korver had his shot locked in Sunday, helping to be the spark that the Hawks needed to overcome a strong push from the Nets. Korver went 6-for-12 from the field and 5-for-11 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 21 points, while also adding seven rebounds and three assists. Korver had hit at least three three-pointers in three of his last four games coming into the playoffs, so it wasn't surprising to see him light it up from deep again Sunday. Both Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll were essential in the win as well though. Carroll finished with 17 points (5-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 5-5 FT), eight rebounds and three assists, while Teague added 17 points (6-12 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), three assists and a steal. With Korver shooting so well, it really opened up the court for Teague, who was able to drive the ball with plenty of success. The Hawks received a solid contribution from Dennis Schroder off their bench as well. Schroder was able to give Teague a few breaks, while also producing 13 points (5-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and two assists over 24 minutes.The Nets were able to keep it close due to the performances from both Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez. Johnson was harassed by the Hawks' crowd in his return to Atlanta, but was able to overcome it with 17 points (6-17 FG, 0-6 3Pt, 5-8 FT), six rebounds and six assists. He wasn't able to have very much success with his three-point shot, but he was able to do a little bit of everything else for the Nets. Lopez, on the other hand, recorded 17 points (6-7 FG, 5-6 FT) of his own, to go along with 14 rebounds and two steals. His 14 rebounds helped Brooklyn secure a 47-39 rebounding advantage over the Hawks, while the double-double was his second over his last four games. Also notching a double-double was Thaddeus Young, who posted 15 points (7-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT), 10 rebounds and three assists over 39 minutes. The Nets' frontcourt had plenty of success against the Hawks' defense, but they'll need to do even more if they want to have a chance in this series. Both Deron Williams and Jarrett Jack finished in double figures as well. Williams had 13 points (5-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and four rebounds, while Jack finished with 13 points (5-8 FG, 3-3 FT) and two assists.These two teams will play again on Wednesday in the second game of a best-of-seven series.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (1-0) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (0-1) 100-86 in game one of their first round playoff series Sunday night in Memphis. The Grizzlies grabbed an early first-quarter lead in this game and never looked back, with Beno Udrih serving as an unlikely hero off the bench and scoring the final eight points of the first period for Memphis. Udrih finished the game with a team-high 20 points (9-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt), seven assists and seven rebounds in just 24 minutes off the bench. The Grizzlies’ starting front court of Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph each posted double-doubles in the winning effort. Randolph scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 36 minutes, while Marc Gasol posted 15 points and 11 rebounds to go along with seven assists and three blocks in 39 minutes of play. Mike Conley played 24 minutes after missing the previous four games with a foot injury and managed to score 16 points in that time, while Jeff Green was the fifth and final Memphis player to score in double figures, recording 11 points and six rebounds in 28 minutes. For the Trail Blazers, it was an offensive night to forget, as they shot just 33.7 percent from the floor as a team and 30.8 percent from behind the arc. Damian Lillard personified the poor shooting effort, scoring just 14 points on a dreadful 5-of-21 (23.8 percent) shooting to go along with eight rebounds and just three assists in 39 minutes. It was Lillard’s worst shooting performance since early March (7.7 percent).The only real bright spot in Portland’s box score was from LaMarcus Aldridge, who finished the night with a game-high 32 points and 14 rebounds, but he shot just 13-of-34 from the field in 42 minutes.The only other Trail Blazer to score in double figures was Nicolas Batum, who recorded 15 points (5-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt), seven rebounds and four assists in 38 minutes. Aldridge and Lillard combined to shooting 55 of Portland’s 95 shots and they will need a better overall team effort to defeat this deep and balanced Memphis team. The two squads will face off in game two in Memphis on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (1-0) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (0-1) 107-92 on Sunday night at the Staples Center. in Game 1 of their first round playoff series.  It was a game of runs, but the Clippers were able to stay in control for majority of the game because they simply had a response for every run the Spurs were able to go on. It was one of the best performances this Los Angeles team has put together all season, as  they dominated a San Antonio team that has been playing its best basketball of the season at the right time. Both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin lead the charge for the Clippers. Paul (13-19 FG, 3-5 3Pt) recorded a game-high 32 points to go along with six rebounds and six assists in 35 minutes, while Griffin put together a double-double of 26 points (9-20 FG, 8-10 FT) and 12 rebounds while also adding six assists, three steals and three blocks in 41 minutes. Jamal Crawford was able to do as he usually does and score 17 points (7-10 FG, 3-4 3Pt) in 23 minutes off the bench while J.J. Reduce was the fourth and final Clipper to score in double figures, finishing with 10. DeAndre Jordan fell one point shy of a double-double, posting nine points and 14 boards in 37 minutes. As a team, Los Angeles shot an impressive 51.3 percent from the field and 55.6 percent from behind the arc on a night where it seemed as if anything and everything was dropping for them.For the Spurs, it was a night to forget, as they shot a dreadful 36.6 percent from the field, 30.3 percent from three and a horrific 53.8 percent from the free throw line. Kawhi Leonard led the way scoring for San Antonio, posting 18 points (7-12 FG), six rebounds and four steals in a team-high 33 minutes. Four other Spurs scored in double figures, but none of them eclipsed 11, with Tim Duncan and Marco Belinelli each posting 11 points and Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili each scoring 10. For a team that tends to do a good job of spreading the scoring wealth, there was not much scoring to go around Sunday night, and they will have to be much more effective if they wish to even the series. The two teams will next meet on Wednesday in Los Angeles for Game 2. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,San Antonio,Spurs,Staples Center,55,27,56,26,10.0,18.0,40.0,78.0,17.0,28.0,46.0,16.0,13.0,4.0,23.0,27.0,81.0,14.0,26.0,45.0,23.0,12.0,Matt Barnes,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,32,Tim Duncan,11.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Blake Griffin,12.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,26.0,9.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,42,Kawhi Leonard,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,33,DeAndre Jordan,14.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,38,Tiago Splitter,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,JJ Redick,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,35,Danny Green,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,21,Chris Paul,7.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,32.0,13.0,20.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,37,Tony Parker,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,28,Jamal Crawford,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,22,Manu Ginobili,7.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,19,Glen Davis,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Aron Baynes,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Austin Rivers,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Boris Diaw,6.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,28,Hedo Turkoglu,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Cory Joseph,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Spencer Hawes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Matt Bonner,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4

												The Washington Wizards  took game one of their series with the Toronto Raptors, 93-86, in overtime Saturday at the Air Canada Centre.The opening game of the 2015 playoffs was a tightly contested, back and forth affair that couldn't be decided in just four quarters. Paul Pierce, who was Toronto's kryptonite a season ago as a member of the Nets, had another huge playoff outing. Pierce finished with a game-high 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting, including the go-ahead three pointer in overtime. Toronto mustered just four points in overtime to finish with just 86 points, which is well below its season average of 104 points. The Raptors are now 0-7 in opening games of the first round. Game two will take place Tuesday in Toronto before the series moves to Washington on Friday.  Washington was 0-3 against Toronto during the regular season, but Paul Pierce and a combination of strong outings from its big men helped lead the Wizards to victory. Nene Hilario, who had been hampered by an ankle injury, posted a double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds. John Wall and Bradley Beal had underwhelming shooting performances, but they made solid contributions in other facets of the game. Still, the Wizards will need their young guards to improve their shooting efficiency to maintain the advantage in the series. Toronto was stifled on the offensive end, shooting just 38 percent from the floor as it dropped the opening game of the series. Kyle Lowry had a frustrating game with just seven points on 2-of-10 shooting before fouling out. The Raptors also struggled on the boards as they were out-rebounded by 13. Outside of DeMar DeRozan's 15 points, the Raptors' starters combined for just 23 points. The Raptors will need Lowry and the rest of their starters to bounce back in order to even the series at one game apiece on Tuesday. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Washington,Wizards,Scotiabank Arena,46,36,49,33,,,,,,,,,,6.0,21.0,39.0,99.0,9.0,15.0,61.0,22.0,10.0,Terrence Ross,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,22,Paul Pierce,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,7.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,36,Tyler Hansbrough,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Nene,13.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Jonas Valanciunas,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Marcin Gortat,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,DeMar DeRozan,11.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,20.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,42,Bradley Beal,9.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,23.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,47,Kyle Lowry,8.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,33,John Wall,6.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,43,Patrick Patterson,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,32,Drew Gooden,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,23,Greivis Vasquez,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,31,Kevin Seraphin,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Amir Johnson,8.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,34,Ramon Sessions,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Lou Williams,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,16.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,32,Otto Porter Jr.,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,33,Landry Fields,,,,,,,,,,,,Rasual Butler,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

												With Mark Jackson anchoring the three-man booth calling the game, the Golden State Warriors (1-0) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (0-1), 106-99. Tyreke Evans suffered a left knee contusion in the first half and did not return. It was the 124th consecutive sellout at Oracle Arena and the Warriors’ 40th home win this season.MVP contender Stephen Curry recorded his sixth playoff game of at least 30 points, concluding with 34 points, five assists, four rebounds, three steals, and four three-pointers in 40 minutes. The Warriors struggled from the free-throw line, converting 21-of-34. Andrew Bogut and Draymond Green each recorded a double-double, highlighted by Green’s playoff career-high and game-high seven assists. Sharpshooter Klay Thompson was held to 6-of-17 from the field but compiled 21 points in 37 minutes. David Lee was unavailable due to a lower back strain, and his availability for the next game is uncertain.The Pelicans erased a 25-point third quarter deficit, closing to within four in the waning moments. In his playoff debut, Anthony Davis scored 35 points, grabbed seven rebounds, blocked four shots, recorded one assist and chipped in one steal in 40 minutes. He scored 20 of the team’s 33 fourth-quarter points, almost single-handedly outscoring the Warriors in the final period. Even though he picked up a technical foul, Quincy Pondexter scored 20 points and recorded team-highs of nine rebounds and six assists in 37 minutes.The Warriors and Pelicans play Game 2 on Monday night at Oracle Arena. The Warriors only lost two home games during the regular season.

												The Chicago Bulls (1-0) grabbed a 1-0 series lead in their 103-91 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks (0-1). Taj Gibson left late in the fourth quarter due to a right knee strain. According to the team, he could have returned and should be fine for the next game.In his first playoff game since April 28, 2012, Derrick Rose scored 23 points, recorded seven assists, notched two steals, blocked one shot and hit three three-pointers in 27 minutes. His first half playing time was cut short due to foul trouble, but coach Tom Thibodeau didn’t remove Rose until 51 seconds remaining, even though the Bulls were ahead by 14. Jimmy Butler scored a playoff career-high 25 points on 8-of-14 shooting in 35 minutes. Pau Gasol was held to 10 points on 5-of-17 shooting and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes, significant given his 46-point, 18-rebound performance against the Bucks earlier this season.The Bucks were unable to channel their first-quarter scoring through the rest of the game. After shooting 59 percent in the opening period, they closed the contest shooting 33 percent over the final three quarters, concluding the fourth quarter with 16 points. Khris Middleton scored a team-high 18 points and nabbed four steals in 34 minutes. John Henson and Jerryd Bayless, both reserves, were the only Bucks to shoot at least 50 percent from the floor. After closing out the regular season with a block in 11 straight contests, Henson failed to block any shots in 26 minutes off the bench. Both teams will resume the series Monday night at the United Center.

												The Houston Rockets (1-0) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (0-1), 118-108, in the opening game of their first round series Saturday at the Toyota Center. The all-Texas series opened with a game that featured several ebbs and flows. Houston got off to a torrid start to gain a 32-19 advantage at the end of the first quarter, but Dallas answered with 36 points in the second to cut the lead down to four at the half. Dallas hung close for the majority of the game, but Houston's big fourth quarter was too much for the Mavericks to overcome. Corey Brewer, who shot just 26.8 percent from beyond the arc during the regular season, provided a huge spark for the Rockets off the bench with three three-pointers in the fourth. Brewer scored 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter to help swing the game in Houston's favor. The Mavericks will look to even the series at one game apiece in game two on Tuesday at the Toyota Center. Dallas was aggressive in making Houston convert its free throws, but the Rockets converted 32 of their 45 attempts from the charity stripe, including 15-of-17 from James Harden. Chandler Parsons returned to the starting lineup after missing the last six games of the regular season with a knee injury, but had a quiet outing against his former team. Parsons finished with 10 points on 5-of-15 shooting from the floor and 0-for-4 from beyond the arc. Devin Harris re-aggravated his toe injury during the game and logged just 10 minutes on the floor. It's unclear whether Harris will be able to play in game two. Tyson Chandler turned in a dominant performance on the glass with 18 rebounds to go with 11 points. Houston managed to put up 118 points despite its star guard James Harden hitting four of his eleven attempts from the floor. Harden did his damage from the free throw line and also dished out 11 assists. Dwight Howard was limited to just 17 minutes on the floor, but that was attributed to foul trouble rather than issues with his knee. The Rockets played well on the defensive end as well, forcing 17 turnovers while also tallying 11 steals and nine blocks. Houston will look to gain a 2-0 advantage in the series Tuesday before it moves to Dallas for game three on Friday.  ",Houston,Rockets,Dallas,Mavericks,Toyota Center,50,32,56,26,,,,,,,,,,4.0,14.0,42.0,96.0,14.0,17.0,49.0,19.0,17.0,Trevor Ariza,11.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,37,Chandler Parsons,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,15.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,36,Terrence Jones,9.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,33,Dirk Nowitzki,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,34,Dwight Howard,5.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Tyson Chandler,18.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,James Harden,2.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,38,Monta Ellis,0.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,5.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,38,Jason Terry,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,25,Rajon Rondo,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,27,Clint Capela,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Al-Farouq Aminu,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Pablo Prigioni,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,21,Devin Harris,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,9,Josh Smith,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,11.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,25,Amar'e Stoudemire,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Corey Brewer,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,23,J.J.

												The Toronto Raptors (49-33) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33-49) 92-87 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.The Raptors came into this matchup as the projected fourth seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs, but were looking to move up into the third seed, where the Chicago Bulls currently sit. The win here puts them in position to take that spot, but only as long as the Bulls lose their matchup against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday as well. If the Raptors finish as the fourth seed, they'll play the Washington Wizards, but if they finish as the third seed, they'll take on the Milwaukee Bucks. The Hornets have been eliminated from the playoffs so this loss marks an end to their season.The Raptors were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Hornets went 42 percent from the floor and 36 percent from deep. After struggling with his shot recently, Kyle Lowry finally broke out of his slump and went off for a game-high of 26 points (8-15 FG, 6-9 3Pt, 4-4 FT), to go along with seven assists and three steals. He had combined to go just 13-for-46 from the field and 3-for-17 from the three-point line over his previous three games, so this was a much needed confidence booster heading into the playoffs. DeMar DeRozan had a solid showing in the win as well, posting 16 points (8-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt), six assists and two steals. He had to sit out of Tuesday's game due to a groin injury, so it was good to see him come back and get a full games worth of work without any setbacks. Jonas Valanciunas and Terrence Ross were the other two Raptors in double figures. Valanciunas finished with 18 points (9-11) and five rebounds, while Ross added 13 points (5-15 FG, 3-13 3Pt) and three assists.After combining to go just 3-for-10 from the field and 0-for-5 from the three-point line during Monday's game against the Rockets, Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker had much better performances this time around. Walker finished with 17 points (6-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT), four assists and three steals, while Henderson recorded 15 points (7-12 FG, 1-1 3Pt) and three rebounds. Neither wanted to end their season as poorly as they played Monday, so they'll be much happier with this performance despite taking the loss. The Hornets saw a nice contribution from their bench as well though, as Troy Daniels finished with a team-high of 24 points (7-15 FG, 6-13 3Pt, 4-4 FT) over 29 minutes. the 24 points were a new season-high for the guard, who has received extra playing time due to the injuries that have taken a toll on this roster here at the end of the season.This marks the final regular season game for both teams.

												The Chicago Bulls (50-32) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (60-22) 91-85 on Wednesday.Derrick Rose played just ten minutes but the Bulls were able to take the regular season finale, in a game with lots of playoff implications. With the victory, Chicago was able to secure the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Toronto Raptors won earlier in the night, which put the Bulls in jeopardy of dropping to the fourth seed. However, that was not the case as they were able to beat the number one seeded Atlanta Hawks. Aaron Brooks stepped his game up with Rose still getting the rust off from his most recent knee injury. Brooks played 33 minutes and had 23 points, six rebounds, three assists and four steals. The Bulls will take on the sixth seeded Milwaukee Bucks (41-41) when the playoffs begin this weekend.The Hawks wrapped up the first seed long ago and had little to play for as the regular season wound down. Dennis Schroder was a spark plug off the bench. He scored 21 points in 17 minutes of 9-of-13 shooting from the field. Paul Millsap and DeMarre Carroll each played 27 minutes but other than that no Atlanta player saw the floor for more than 23 minutes. They ended the season on a three-game losing streak but were looking to stay healthy and rested for their up-coming playoff appearance as the first seed in the Eastern Conference.

												The Dallas Mavericks (50-32) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (51-31) 114-98 on Wednesday.Tyson Chandler led the Mavericks to victory in the final game of the regular season. He dropped 22 points, 15 rebounds and one block in 25 minutes on the Trail Blazers. He got some help from Amar'e Stoudemire, who came off the bench and scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds in 18 minutes. Dallas has been locked into the seventh seed in the Western Conference playoffs for some time now. They'll be taking on the second-seeded Houston Rockets (56-26) when they playoffs begin this weekend.It was the usual suspects getting it done for Portland against the Mavericks. Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge combined for 36 points, but it wasn't enough to get it done on Wednesday. The Trail Blazers will be the number four seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and that wasn't going to change regardless of the outcome of this game. Allen Crabbe was the lone starter to play more than 30 minutes and all four bench players who saw the floor played more than 23 minutes. The Blazers will host the fifth seeded Memphis Grizzlies (55-27) in the opening round of the playoffs.

												The Houston Rockets (56-26) concluded the regular season with an 117-91 win over the Utah Jazz (38-44). The Rockets jumped out to a 65-35 halftime lead. They clinched the two seed in the Western Conference following the San Antonio Spurs’ loss to the New Orleans Pelicans and will face the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs.James Harden conceded the scoring title to the Thunders’ Russell Westbrook, but did his best Westbrook imitation by securing a triple-double in fewer than 28 minutes. The potential Most Valuable Player recipient provided 16 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, one steal, one block and two three-pointers. Aside from finishing second in scoring, Harden’s 1.9 steals per game was fifth best in the league. Dwight Howard returned to the lineup after sitting out the previous game, accumulating 14 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes. The Rockets hit 12 more three-pointers, extending their single-season NBA record to 921 makes from downtown.Derrick Favors made a brief appearance after missing the previous two games due to back problems. He finagled four points in nine minutes to close out his best season as a pro. Gordon Hayward and Trevor Booker were given the night off, and coach Quin Snyder ran a 10-man rotation. Rudy Gobert made one last push for Most Improved Player and Defensive Player of the Year awards, notching three blocks and one steal in 24 minutes. He finished the year with 2.3 blocks per game, third best among qualifiers. The Jazz ended the season with the 11th worst record in the league after posting a 19-10 mark after the All-Star break.

												The Boston Celtics (40-42) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (41-41) 105-100 on Wednesday in Milwaukee.In the final game of the regular season, neither the Bucks nor Celtics had anything but pride to play for, as both teams were locked into the No. 6 and 7 seeds respectively. Nevertheless, both teams competed till the bitter end. Boston, however, was able to steadily lead the fourth quarter and pull away in the end for the victory. Luigi Datome led the way for the Celtics, as he scored 22 points (9-15 FG, 3-7 3Pt) in a spot start with Jae Crowder sidelined with a sore right ankle. It can be expected that it was just precautionary and Crowder will make a return to Boston’s rotation once the postseason begins. Datome was the only starter to score in double figures for the Celtics, but both Jonas Jerebko and Kelly Olynyk were able to each score 16 points in 23 and 22 minutes off the bench respectively. Boston was very efficient on offense, shooting a respectable 49 percent from the field and a very solid 43 percent from behind the arc. They also recorded 37 assists on 42 made field goals to just 16 turnovers. They will take on the No. 2 seed Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the NBA playoffs this weekend. The Bucks’ starters all played limited minutes with their fate already sealed. However, both Ersan Ilyasova and Khris Middleton played well in those minutes. Ilyasova scored a game-high 21 points (8-13 FG, 3-5 3Pt) to go along with five rebounds and four assists in 26 minutes, while Khris Middleton scored an incredibly efficient 18 points (8-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt) in 21 minutes. O.J. Mayo was able to score 16 points (7-14 FG, 1-6 3Pt) and grab five rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench, while Tyler Ennis scored 11 points (5-13 FG) and dished out 8 assists in 27 minutes off the bench. Milwaukee also shared the ball well, recording 35 assists on 41 made field goals, but unfortunately for them it was not enough. Regardless, the Bucks still will be the No. 6 seed and will play the Chicago Bulls once the playoffs begin. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Boston,Celtics,Fiserv Forum,40,42,41,41,7.0,21.0,37.0,85.0,10.0,14.0,45.0,35.0,17.0,12.0,25.0,39.0,78.0,6.0,10.0,37.0,35.0,16.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,28,Evan Turner,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,17,Ersan Ilyasova,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,26,Brandon Bass,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Zaza Pachulia,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Tyler Zeller,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Khris Middleton,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,20,Gigi Datome,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,9.0,15.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,27,Michael Carter-Williams,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Marcus Smart,4.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,24,Johnny O'Bryant III,9.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,21,Gerald Wallace,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,18,John Henson,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Jared Sullinger,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,11.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,27,Tyler Ennis,3.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,27,Phil Pressey,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,26,O.J.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (45-37) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-66) 138-113 on Wednesday in Minnesota.The Thunder were fighting for their playoff lives, as they needed a win and a loss from the Pelicans in order to clinch the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.They got the win they needed on the back of Russell Westbrook, who helped Oklahoma City end the game in the first quarter by jumping out to a 47-29 lead after the first 12 minutes. Westbrook scored 23 points in that opening period and finished with 37 points (11-20 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 13-17 FT), eight rebounds and seven assists in just 32 minutes of play. That effort was enough for him to be the NBA scoring champion for the 2014-15 season.Dion Waiters was not too far behind, putting in one of his best performances of the season, scoring 33 points (12-23 FG, 5-8 3Pt) in 36 minutes. Enes Kanter posted a monster double-double of 25 points (11-17 FG) and 15 rebounds in 34 minutes. Nick Collison was the only other Thunder player to score in double figures with 12 points in 26 minutes. Despite the dominating victory, Oklahoma City did not get the loss from the Pelicans that they needed to reach the playoffs, as they defeated the Spurs, and the Thunder have been eliminated from playoff contention just one year after reaching the Western Conference finals. The Timberwolves could not end the season on a high note, but they still got great final performances out of both of their rookies. Andrew Wiggins scored 23 points (6-12 FG, 11-13 FT) and grabbed six rebounds in 38 minutes, while Zach LaVine recorded a double-double of 19 points (6-16 FG, 6-6 FT) and 13 assists in 41 minutes. Kevin Martin led the way scoring, putting up 29 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the field. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Target Center,45,37,16,66,,,,,,,,,,12.0,27.0,50.0,91.0,22.0,31.0,43.0,21.0,13.0,Andrew Wiggins,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,23.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,37,Andre Roberson,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Adreian Payne,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Enes Kanter,15.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,25.0,11.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,33,Arinze Onuaku,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Steven Adams,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Kevin Martin,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,29.0,9.0,15.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,32,Dion Waiters,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,33.0,12.0,23.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,35,Zach LaVine,5.0,13.0,3.0,1.0,19.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,40,Russell Westbrook,8.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,37.0,11.0,20.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,31,Justin Hamilton,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,11,Anthony Morrow,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,19,Robbie Hummel,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25,Nick Collison,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,26,Lorenzo Brown,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,20,D.J.

												The Pelicans (45-37) pulled off a 108-103 victory over the Spurs (55-27) on Wednesday, clinching a playoff berth.The Pelicans controlled their own destiny coming into the game. Eighth place in the Western Conference, they were ahead of the Thunder by way of tiebreaker. San Antonio also had a lot to play for. A win would have ensured home court advantage in the first two rounds of the playoffs. Instead of nailing down the two-seed in the West, the best the Spurs can hope for is third place. Worst-case scenario, the Spurs fall to sixth place with a Rockets loss and a Grizzlies win. The Pelicans jumped out to a 34-19 lead in the first quarter. At halftime, they were up 16 points. Going into the fourth, the Pelicans led 82-73. The Spurs came as close as three points with 11 seconds on the clock, but Jrue Holiday’s foul shots iced the game.Anthony Davis had a monster day. He was the Pelicans’ leading scorer with 31 points (12-26 FG), to go with 13 rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in 43 minutes. Tyreke Evans also stuffed the stats sheet, recording 19 points (9-15 FG, 1-2 3Pt), four rebounds, 11 assists, three steals and one block in 34 minutes. Eric Gordon contributed 14 points (5-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt), four rebounds, one assist and one steal in 33 minutes. Jrue Holiday (lower leg), who was listed as questionable coming into Wednesday’s contest, had 11 points (4-9 FG, 1-1 3Pt), three rebounds and four assists in 25 minutes.Tony Parker was the Spurs’ leading scorer with 23 points (11-17 FG), one rebound and six assists in 35 minutes. Boris Diaw came off the bench and recorded 20 points (10-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt), five rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes. Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard combined for 29 points and 20 rebounds. The Pelicans had the Spurs' number all year, finishing their season series 3-1.  ",New Orleans,Pelicans,San Antonio,Spurs,Smoothie King Center,55,27,45,37,5.0,10.0,43.0,83.0,17.0,25.0,35.0,23.0,9.0,3.0,10.0,44.0,78.0,10.0,13.0,36.0,33.0,15.0,Quincy Pondexter,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Kawhi Leonard,10.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,38,Anthony Davis,13.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,31.0,12.0,26.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,43,Tim Duncan,10.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Omer Asik,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Aron Baynes,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Eric Gordon,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,32,Danny Green,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Tyreke Evans,4.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,19.0,9.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,34,Tony Parker,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,11.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,35,Dante Cunningham,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Manu Ginobili,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,20,Jrue Holiday,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,25,Boris Diaw,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,34,Ryan Anderson,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,21,Marco Belinelli,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Norris Cole,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Cory Joseph,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,7,Alexis Ajinca,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Patty Mills,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,10

												The Nets (38-44) took care of business Wednesday, defeating the Magic (25-57) 101-88.The game was a must-win for Brooklyn, who trail the eighth place Pacers by a half-game in the Eastern Conference. If the Pacers fall to the Grizzlies, they’ll relinquish their playoff spot to the Nets. If not, Brooklyn’s season is over. A loss would not improve Orlando’s draft position, so the Magic had nothing to play for but pride. They put up a good fight. Orlando led by two points at halftime. Midway through the third, they extended their lead to 10 points. But, by the end of the quarter, the Nets had closed the gap, tying the game 75-75. The fourth quarter was all Brooklyn, as they outscored the Magic 26-13. The Nets’ leading scorer came off the bench. Bojan Bogdanovic had 28 points (12-17 FG, 4-8 3Pt), three rebounds and two assists in 34 minutes. Thaddeus Young had 16 points (5-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block in 37 minutes. Joe Johnson also scored 16 points (7-15 FG, 2-4 3Pt), to go with seven rebounds, six assists and one steal in 41 minutes. Brook Lopez had a relatively quiet game, recording 14 points (4-8 FG), seven rebounds, one assist, four steals and three blocks in 33 minutes. Nikola Vucevic was the Magic’s leading scorer with 26 points (12-21 FG, 0-1 3Pt), to go with 11 rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block in 40 minutes. Victor Oladipo had 19 points (7-17 FG, 3-7 3Pt), two rebounds, three assists and one block in 44 minutes. Andrew Nicholson contributed 18 points (8-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt), nine rebounds, one assist and one block in 28 minutes.With the victory, the Nets completed the season series sweep of the Magic 3-0.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (53-29) defeated the Washington Wizards (46-36) 113-108 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics.With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6-for-11 from the floor and 4-for-5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double-double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season-highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4-7 FG, 4-4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6-12 FG, 5-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest.Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5-9 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season-high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7-19 FG, 3-8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 7.6 points and 2.6 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6-13 FG, 0-1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4-8 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and six assists.This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.

												The Detroit Pistons (32-50) ended the season with an 112-90 victory over the New York Knicks (17-65). Seven Pistons finished with at least 10 points in the season finale.In what may be his final game in a Pistons uniform, Greg Monroe compiled 10 points and four steals as he heads into the offseason an unrestricted free agent. Impending restricted free agent Reggie Jackson performed marvelously, supplying 24 points, 11 assists, four rebounds and three steals in 32 minutes. Andre Drummond scored 17 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. He completed the season second to the Los Angeles Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan in rebounds per game while leading the league in offensive rebounds per game. Jodie Meeks sank both free throws and ends the season behind only the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry in free-throw percentage. The Pistons head into the offseason with the eighth-worst record in the league.The Knicks ended the season with their worst record in franchise history. Their futility gives them the second-worst record in the league and a 19.9 percent chance of winning the NBA Draft Lottery. They’re guaranteed at least a top-five pick. Langston Galloway ended the year second in minutes per game and scoring average among rookies. He also connected on a rookie high 1.4 three-pointers per game. Cole Aldrich scored a career-high 24 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in 27 minutes, taking advantage of garbage time.

												The Miami Heat (37-45) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18-64) 105-101 on Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.With both teams having already been eliminated from the playoffs, this game was more about giving the young and inexperienced players a chance to make an impression on the coaching staff in hopes of coming back with their team next season in a bigger and better role. As a team, the Heat finished at 44 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers went 46 percent from the floor but just 18 percent from deep.The Heat rested nearly their whole team in this game, with just six players seeing the court and four players not coming out of the game even once. Michael Beasley was one of those players who played the full 48 minutes Wednesday as a starter. He went off for a game-high of 34 points (12-27 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 10-11 FT), to go along with 11 rebounds and eight assists in a near triple-double effort.  They were season-highs across the board for Beasley, who hadn't even broken the 20-point mark yet this season. James Ennis also had a huge game, filling up the stat sheet like Beasley. Over 48 minutes, he recorded 17 points (7-20 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 1-2 FT), 12 rebounds and six assists, marking one of his best games of the season as well. Averaging just 4.8 points, 2.7 rebounds and 0.7 assists per game over the course of the season, this was a great finish for the forward. Both Zoran Dragic and Henry Walker were in the starting lineup as well and put up some points. Dragic finished with 22 points (9-17 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and two steals, while Walker chipped in with 21 points (6-10 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and four rebounds.Despite taking the loss, the Sixers still had some impressive performances of their own. Jakarr Sampson stood out once again. He recorded a team-high of 22 points (8-15 FG, 0-5 3Pt, 6-7 FT), while also adding five rebounds and six assists. Sampson has seen extended time here at the back end of the season, as he's averaged 16.7 points and 5.7 rebounds over his last three games. Robert Covington really struggled with his shot, but got to the free throw line enough to score 19 points (4-14 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 9-10 FT), to go along with four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting over 40 percent from the field and scoring more than 20 points in his previous three games, this was somewhat of a let-down performance for Covington in the season finale. The Sixers also received a ton of production off their bench from the likes of Hollis Thompson and Thomas Robinson. Thompson finished with 19 points (8-15 FG, 3-7 3Pt) and four assists, while Robinson ended with 13 points (5-7 FG, 3-3 FT) and 10 rebounds.With both teams failing to make the playoffs, this marks the end of their respective seasons.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (55-27) beat the Indiana Pacers (38-44) 95-83 on Wednesday.Marc Gasol ended his spectacular season with another splendid performance. He absolutely dominated the Pacer's interior, with 33 points and 13 rebounds. Gasol also held his opposing counterpart Roy Hibbert to just seven points and four assists in 25 minutes. With Mike Conley out with a foot injury, it was up to Beno Urdih and Nick Calathes to man the point guard position. Udrih started and played 16 minutes, while Calathes played 32 minutes and finished with eight points, six rebounds, six assists and four steals. The win put Memphis in the fifth seed for the Western Conference playoffs. They'll be taking on the Portland Trail Blazers (51-31) in the first round of the playoffs.Indiana would've clinched a playoff birth with a win but didn't have an answer for Gasol's beastly play. It certainly didn't help that Paul George exited the game with a left calf injury, after playing 15 minutes. The Pacers did take advantage of Conley's absence, as the starting backcourt duo of George Hill and C.J. Miles combined for 46 points on 19-of-38 shooting from the field. Indiana ended the season with a record identical to the Brooklyn Nets, but the Nets own the tie-breaker and will be taking on the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the Eastern Conferences playoffs.

												The Golden State Warriors (67-15) defeated the Denver Nuggets (30-52) 133-126 on Wednesday.The Warriors clinched the Western Conference long ago and at this point were just trying to stay healthy for the playoffs. In a somewhat meaningless game for Golden State, no starter played more than 20 minutes, and no bench players saw the floor for more than 25 minutes. Despite playing just 16 minutes, Klay Thompson managed to lead the Warriors with 25 points on 8-for-12 shooting from the field and 5-for-7 from downtown. Golden State will take on the New Orleans Pelicans (45-37) when the playoffs commence this weekend.The Nuggets ended a second straight disappointing season with a loss to the top-seeded Warriors. Jusuf Nurkic finished an up and down season with 17 points and nine rebounds for Denver, as Kenneth Faried was held out of the regular season finale to rest. With a 30 win season, the Nuggets end 2014-2015 as the 12th best team in the Western Conference. They finished 15 wins behind the eighth-seeded New Orleans Pelicans.

												The Sacramento Kings (29-53) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (21-61) 122-99 on Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Because both teams have already been eliminated from the playoffs, this gave each coaching staff another shot at evaluating talent for next season. It also cemented the Lakers into having the fourth worst record in the league, which means they'll have the fourth best odds at getting the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft.The Kings dominated this game, as they went 55 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers finished at 38 percent from the floor and 29 percent from deep. It was the duo of Ben McLemore and Derrick Williams that helped lead the Kings to such a large victory. McLemore posted 24 points (9-18 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 4-6 FT), five rebounds and seven assists, while Williams recorded 22 points (9-16 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and six rebounds off the bench. McLemore has been very inconsistent all season long, so it was good to see him at least end with a strong performance. Williams also finished on a high note, as he combined for 42 points and seven rebounds over his final two outings. Ray McCallum chipped in with 19 points (7-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-9 FT) and six assists, while Nik Stauskas was in the starting lineup and posted 14 points (5-9 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and five assists.The Lakers were led by a huge performance from Jabari Brown. Brown went 9-for-19 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 32 points, while also adding three rebounds. He's been one of the few bright spots here at the end of the season for the Lakers, as he's averaged 22.0 points over his final four games. He'll likely find himself a role somewhere next season after showing what he can do on the court this year. Vander Blue also had a solid showing, finishing with 15 points (6-23 FG, 1-8 3Pt, 2-3 FT), seven rebounds and eight assists. With so many injuries in the backcourt, the second-year guard played the whole game Wednesday and took advantage, posting career-highs in points, rebounds and assists in just his second game for the Lakers this season. Jordan Hill added 12 points (5-14 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six rebounds as well.   With both teams missing the playoffs, this marks the end of their respective seasons.

												The Boston Celtics (39-42) defeated the Toronto Raptors (48-33) 95-93 on Tuesday at the TD Garden in Boston.Down two points with just over 10 seconds left in the game, Kyle Lowry brought the Raptors back to tie the Celtics after a driving layup. It was the Celtics who came out with the last laugh though, as Jae Crowder hit a clutch jump shot with just under a second left in regulation to pull out the victory. It was a solid victory for the Celtics, as they're now going to go into the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference standings, meaning they'll take on the Cleveland Cavaliers during the first round. The Raptors, on the other hand, moved down into the fourth seed in the East, a game behind the Chicago Bulls, which would mean they could end up playing the fiffth-seeded Washington Wizards in their first playoff matchup.It was the duo of Avery Bradley and Evan Turner that had the biggest impact in securing the win Tuesday. Turner nearly came out with a triple-double, finishing with 14 points (7-14 FG), seven rebounds and nine assists. It wasn't all good for the forward though, as he did record seven turnovers as well. He's combined for 29 points and 14 assists over his last two games, and he'll need to continue to play well if the Celtics want any chance at pulling off an upset during the playoffs. Bradley recorded 14 points (5-11 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT) of his own, to go along with three rebounds and two assists, but he ended up suffering a left quad contusion and was forced to leave the game. He'll likely sit Wednesday's finale out in order to get healthy for their first playoff matchup. Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller were the other two starters in double figures. Bass finished with 13 points (4-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and nine rebounds, while Zeller added 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds.For the Raptors, Kyle Lowry went 6-for-20 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to match a team-high of 16 points, while also recording six rebounds and four assists. Lowry has really struggled with his shot lately, combining to go just 9-for-34 from the field over his last two games, so he really needs to get things turned around if the Raptors want to have some success in the playoffs. Despite struggling with his shot similar to Lowry, Louis Williams still posted 16 points (3-13 FG, 0-4 3Pt), as he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times, while converting on 10-of-11. Williams continues to be a great offensive option off the Raptors' bench, averaging 20.7 points over his last six games. Jonas Valanciunas nearly came up with a double-double, posting 10 points (4-8 FG, 2-4 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots, while Greivis Vasquez chipped in with 11 points (4-7 FG, 3-6 3Pt), five rebounds and seven assists.   The Celtics will close out the regular season on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, while the Raptors will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers (38-43) kept their playoff hopes alive Tuesday with a 99-95 double-overtime victory over the the Washington Wizards (46-35) at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.The Pacers were in a must-win situation Tuesday after recent skids by the Heat and Nets vaulted them temporarily into the eighth seed in the East. Both teams got off to frigid starts on the offensive end, highlighted by an 0-for-9 stretch by the Pacers in the second quarter. Neither team reached the 50-point mark until the 4:20 mark in the third quarter when John Wall found Marcin Gortat for an easy layup. The teams went back-and-forth throughout the fourth quarter, but a missed John Wall floater at the buzzer sent the game into overtime. One overtime wasn't enough to decide the outcome, however, as the Pacers and Wizards mustered just four points apiece in the first extra period. Indiana's George Hill clutch three-pointer in the second OT gave the Pacers a five point lead with under 30 seconds remaining to help seal the victory. The Pacers are in position to clinch the East's final playoff spot with a win Wednesday against the Grizzlies or a Nets loss. Washington entered Tuesday with the fifth seed in hand, but decided to play its starters against a playoff caliber team. Nene Hill was sidelined with an ankle injury, which moved veteran Drew Gooden into the starting lineup. Five different Wizards logged over 40 minutes of playing time, led by Marcin Gortat and John Wall with 44 minutes. Wall finished with 16 points on 7-of-23 shooting and added 11 assists while Gortat posted 19 points and 10 rebounds. Washington will finish wrap up the regular season Wednesday in Cleveland.Indiana lost seven out of eight in late March to temporarily fall out of a playoff spot, but its current six-game win streak has given it control of its playoff destiny. George Hill finished just shy of a triple-double with 24 points, 10 assists, and nine rebounds. C.J Miles followed his 30-point outing Sunday with a 25 point performance and he also grabbed eight rebounds. Paul George exceeded his minutes restriction, finishing with 10 points in 18 minutes on the floor. Indiana's win eliminated Miami from playoff contention, but a matchup with Memphis on Wednesday will be no easy task for the Pacers just one night after a double-overtime victory. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Washington,Wizards,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,46,35,38,43,9.0,30.0,40.0,102.0,10.0,17.0,54.0,20.0,13.0,7.0,24.0,37.0,104.0,14.0,17.0,59.0,22.0,11.0,Solomon Hill,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,22,Paul Pierce,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,17,David West,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,41,Drew Gooden,10.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,38,Roy Hibbert,12.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37,Marcin Gortat,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,43,CJ Miles,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25.0,9.0,22.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,42,Bradley Beal,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,24.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,41,George Hill,9.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,24.0,11.0,25.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,48,John Wall,2.0,11.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,23.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,44,Paul George,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,17,Otto Porter Jr.,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,42,Ian Mahinmi,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Kris Humphries,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Rodney Stuckey,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,34,Rasual Butler,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,14,Luis Scola,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Kevin Seraphin,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Donald Sloan,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9,Ramon Sessions,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,13

												The Los Angeles Clippers (56-26) defeated the Phoenix Suns (39-43) 112-101 on Tuesday at the US Airways Center and are now guaranteed finish no lower than the  third seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The Clippers led by as many as 30 points in this contest, but their reserves allowed the Suns to cut the lead down to 11 late in the fourth quarter. Still, the lead proved to be insurmountable as the Clippers notched a franchise-record eighth consecutive road win. Chris Paul finished with 22 points and six assists over 29 minutes of action and DeAndre Jordan had another double-double with 13 points and 14 rebounds. Paul played in all 82 games this season for the first time in his career. Los Angeles finished the regular season winning 14 of its final 15 games and seven in a row. While the Clippers starting lineup is loaded with star power, questions remain about their bench corps being an Achilles heel in the post season. The Rockets and Spurs, both sitting at 55-26, will finish their respective seasons Wednesday. Those games have major implications on the West's final standings, but the Clippers will be slotted no lower than third. Phoenix's disappointing second half came to an end Tuesday. The Suns had a legitimate chance at winning the eighth seed in the West when they moved to 38-33 in late March, but a 1-9 finish down the stretch eliminated them from contention. Phoenix started the year with a crowded back court that featured Goran Dragic, Isaiah Thomas, and Eric Bledsoe, but a flurry of trade deadline moves jettisoned Dragic and Thomas to the Eastern Conference and brought Brandon Knight to the Suns. Knight was hampered by an ankle injury for much of the second half of the season, causing him to miss all but one game after March 9. The Suns have narrowly missed the playoffs two years in a row, but players like Markieff Morris and Eric Bledsoe should keep them a competitive team next season. 											",Phoenix,Suns,Los Angeles,Clippers,Talking Stick Resort Arena,56,26,39,43,,,,,,,,,,15.0,38.0,42.0,87.0,13.0,18.0,43.0,26.0,12.0,P.J.

												The Houston Rockets (55-26) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33-48) 100-90 on Monday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte. After coming into Monday sitting as the projected sixth seed in the Western Conference standings, the Rockets were able to pull themselves even with the San Antonio Spurs for the second overall seed. The Spurs still hold the tiebreaker over the Rockets though, so in order to get the second seed going into the playoffs, the Rockets will need both a win of their own and a Spurs loss in the final games on Wednesday. They'll also have to deal with the likes of the Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies as well though, who both remain just a half game back from the Rockets and Spurs. Despite shooting just 41 percent from the field and 26 percent from deep, the Rockets were still able come out with the win due to a strong third quarter where they out-scored the Hornets 31-23. Like he's done for the majority of the season already, James Harden put the team on his back and finished with a game-high of 29 points (7-20 FG, 1-8 3Pt, 14-16 FT), to go along with six rebounds and six assists. He didn't have the best day shooting the ball, but he continued to get to the free throw line at a very high rate. He's now combined for 59 points and 12 assists over his last two games, so he'll try and stay hot as the Rockets head into the playoffs later this week. Harden received some help from Josh Smith though, as he came off the bench for 16 points (5-13 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 5-6 FT), 11 rebounds and two blocked shots. He's also played well of late and has averaged 16.3 points and 7.3 rebounds over his last three games. Also off the bench, Corey Brewer added 11 points (5-9 FG, 1-1 3Pt) and three rebounds over 24 minutes, while Clint Capela chipped in with 10 points (4-4 FG, 2-4 FT) and five rebounds over 17 minutes. Dwight Howard was held out of this game for a night of rest. Like the Rockets, the Hornets also saw some strong contributions off their bench. Brian Roberts led the way, going 8-for-19 from the field and 5-for-12 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 23 points, while also adding five rebounds and three assists. With just one game left in the season, it's good to see Roberts end on a high note, as he's averaging just 6.5 points and 2.2 assists on the season. Troy Daniels also shot the ball well during his time on the court. Over 28 minutes, he finished with 15 points (6-10 FG, 3-6 3Pt) and two assists. It matched a season-high in points for Daniels, a season-high that he had just set during Friday's game against the Hawks. While the bench had a solid showing, the starters really struggled. Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker were absolutely brutal, combining to go just 3-for-20 from the field and 0-for-5 from the three-point line to score just six points. The Rockets' finish the regular season off at home against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, while the Hornets will travel to Toronto to play the Raptors on Wednesday. 											",Charlotte,Hornets,Houston,Rockets,Spectrum Center,55,26,33,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jeffery Taylor,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,29,Trevor Ariza,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,35,Marvin Williams,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,25,Terrence Jones,11.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,10.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,31,Bismack Biyombo,13.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Joey Dorsey,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Gerald Henderson,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,29,James Harden,6.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,29.0,7.0,20.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,36,Kemba Walker,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,27,Jason Terry,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,28,Troy Daniels,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,28,Josh Smith,11.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,16.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,30,Noah Vonleh,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,22,Pablo Prigioni,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,19,Jason Maxiell,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Corey Brewer,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,23,Brian Roberts,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,19.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,28,Clint Capela,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,PJ Hairston,,,,,,,,,,,,Dwight Howard,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (52-29) defeated the Detroit Pistons (31-50) 109-97 on Monday.J.R. Smith hit eight three-pointers to lead the Cavs past the Pistons. His teammate Kyrie Irving went 2-for-3 from three-point land, but sat out the second half as a precautionary measure when his hip tightened up. Matthew Dellavedova stepped in at point guard for Cleveland and finished with two points, five assists and no turnovers in 31 minutes. LeBron James had 21 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his second triple-double of the season. The last one came against the Chicago Bulls back on  Apr. 5. Cleveland has the second seed locked up in the Eastern Conference. They are just waiting to see who lands in the seventh spot when the regular season concludes on Wednesday. They're 4-2 in April and finish up with the Washington Wizards on Wednesday in Cleveland.The Pistons had all five starters plus Jodie Meeks score in double figures, but it wasn't enough to stop the Cavs. Even with Irving out of the lineup in the second half, they couldn't overcome the 15-point lead Cleveland had at halftime. Andre Drummond lead Detroit with 20 points, nine rebounds and three blocks. It was the first time Drummond played 30 or more minutes and didn't record 10 rebounds since Feb. 28. The Pistons are 2-5 in April and will look to end their season on a positive note when they take on the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (41-40) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18-63) 107-97 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The Bucks continued to gain some steam as the regular season winds down, notching their third straight victory and finishing the season sweep over the Sixers. They've already locked up the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings, so this was another solid momentum builder for the playoffs that start this coming Saturday. The game did get somewhat chippy towards the end though, as both Jerryd Bayless and O.J. Mayo received technical fouls for the Bucks, while Jakaar Sampson picked one up for the Sixers.The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers finished at 40 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep. Michael Carter-Williams had another strong showing, finishing with 30 points (11-17 FG, 8-13 FT), five rebounds, five assists and three steals. Over his last four games, he's averaged 22.8 points, six assists and 2.8 steals, so the Bucks would love to see him stay this hot going into their playoff series with either the Toronto Raptors or Chicago Bulls. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid overall game as well, recording 12 points (3-9 FG, 6-10 FT), seven rebounds and three assists over 34 minutes. He'll take season averages of 12.8 points and 6.7 rebounds into the Bucks' final matchup on Wednesday. The only other two players to reach double figures in points were Ersan Ilyasova and O.J. Mayo. Ilyasova finished with 13 points (5-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and three steals, while Mayo posted 13 points (5-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), four rebounds and three steals of his own.The Sixers were led by the duo of Robert Covington and Hollis Thompson. Covington went 6-for-13 from the field, but just 1-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 25 points, while also adding seven rebounds and four blocked shots. It wasn't all good for the forward though, as he turned the ball over a whopping 10 times. He's played well over these final games other than the turnovers, averaging 24.0 points over his last three. Thompson, on the other hand, finished with 19 points (7-18 FG, 3-10 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds over 36 minutes. Thompson shot less than 40 percent from the field in three of his last four games coming into this one, so it was a step in the right direction Monday with his performance. Thomas Robinson and Jakaar Sampson finished in double figures off the bench. Robinson posted 12 points (4-8 FG, 4-6 FT) and six rebounds, while Sampson had 10 points (3-8 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds.  The Bucks' regular season will come to an end at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday.

												The New York Knicks (17-64) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (60-21) 112-108 on Monday at Philips Arena in Atlanta. While the Knicks have already been eliminated from the playoffs, this game did carry some weight in regards to their 2015 NBA Draft lottery odds. The Timberwolves now have taken over as the worst record in the league, so they'll likely end up with the highest odds come draft day in June for that number one overall pick. The Hawks, on the other hand, weren't affected much by the loss, as they've already locked up the number one overall seed for the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. It still hasn't been determined who they'll play yet, but it should be either the Boston Celtics, Indiana Pacers, Brooklyn Nets or Miami Heat. The Knicks were the superior shooters in this game, going 56 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three-point line, while the Hawks finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 34 percent from deep. The Knicks turned the ball over 18 times compared to just eight from the Hawks, but they were able to overcome the disparity with their strong shooting. Langston Galloway had an extremely impressive performance. He went 10-for-12 from the field and a perfect 6-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 26 points, while adding five rebounds and six assists as well. It was a complete turn around from Saturday's game against the Magic where he shot just 25 percent (4-16 FG) from the field, so the Knicks were happy to see the guard play so well with the season coming to an end. Tim Hardaway Jr. also had a very strong showing, finishing with 23 points (9-17 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and five assists over 36 minutes. It was just the seventh time this season that he's reached the 20-point mark, as he's averaging just 11.1 points on the season. Jason Smith had a big game with 20 points (7-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-5 FT), nine rebounds and five assists over 36 minutes as well. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver did their best to pull out this win for the Hawks. Teague finished with 19 points (7-17 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), nine assists and two steals, while Korver posted 19 points (4-10 FG, 4-9 3Pt, 7-7 FT) and five rebounds. Korver has been hitting three-pointers at a very high rate as the season has been winding down. He's made at least three three-pointers in six of his last seven games, which bodes well for the Hawks as the playoffs begin Saturday. With Paul Millsap getting the night off in hopes of having his shoulder return closer to 100 percent, both Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll put up some points in the frontcourt. Carroll finished with 16 points (5-11 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and four rebounds over 33 minutes, while Horford added 18 points (9-17 FG) and six rebounds over 33 minutes. While the Hawks' starters all played well, they just happened to run into the Knicks at the wrong time, as the Knicks played one of their best offensive games of the season. The Knicks' final game of the season will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, while the Hawks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,New York,Knicks,State Farm Arena,17,64,60,21,11.0,32.0,39.0,88.0,19.0,23.0,37.0,27.0,8.0,13.0,25.0,43.0,77.0,13.0,19.0,39.0,33.0,17.0,DeMarre Carroll,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,33,Lance Thomas,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,33,Al Horford,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,9.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Jason Smith,9.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,20.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,36,Mike Muscala,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Cole Aldrich,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,Kyle Korver,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,4.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,34,Langston Galloway,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,26.0,10.0,12.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,32,Jeff Teague,5.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,17.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,34,Tim Hardaway Jr.,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,23.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,35,Kent Bazemore,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,16,Lou Amundson,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Mike Scott,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,21,Quincy Acy,4.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,25,Elton Brand,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Cleanthony Early,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12,Shelvin Mack,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,16,Shane Larkin,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,22,John Jenkins,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,9,Ricky Ledo,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8

												The Chicago Bulls (49-32) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (37-44) 113-86 on Monday.Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to lead the Bulls with 26 points in 24 minutes. He has continued to impress when he gets the chance to play. In March he averaged 20.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 30.8 minutes a game. He was putting up 9.7 points and 4.8 rebounds in April, coming into Monday's game. His role was increased against Brooklyn because Joakim Noah sat out with a knee injury. Taj Gibson also saw an uptick in minutes. He jumped into the starting lineup at power forward for the Bulls, as Pau Gasol was moved to center. Gibson had 15 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots. Gasol had a dominant all-around performance with 22 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocks against a hot Brook Lopez. Chicago has the night off on Tuesday and will host the number one seed in the Eastern Conference, the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday. The Bulls will either be the number two or number three seed. On their off-day Tuesday, they can watch the Toronto Raptors, who they are currently battling for the second seed with.The Nets ran into a tough Bull's defense and had a hard time getting their starters points. Lopez lead the Bulls with 13 points to go along with eight rebounds, but he would've liked to have a better game with Noah out of the lineup. Jarrett Jack and Bojan Bogdanovic combined for 32 points off the bench but it wasn't nearly enough as Chicago took it too the Nets in a 30-15 third quarter to add to the seven point lead they already had at halftime. This loss dropped the Nets out of the eighth seed in the playoffs for the time being. The Indiana Pacers had off Monday, as they slipped into the eighth seed with the Brooklyn's loss. The Nets will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday as they hope for a playoff birth.

												The Miami Heat (36-45) beat the Orlando Magic (25-56) 100-93 on Monday.Hassan Whiteside dominated the Orlando interior and finished with a spectacular 24-point, 13-rebound, five-block performance. On Saturday, he put up 16 points, 18 rebounds and six blocks on the Toronto Raptors. He's proving he can be a forced to be reckoned with. If his team can sneak into the eighth seed of the Eastern Conference, they might be able to do some damage on the number-one seeded Atlanta Hawks. Even though they've won just two of their last eight, Miami still has an outside chance to make the playoffs.The Magic were lead by Victor Oladipo's 30 points, four steals and two blocks. Tobias Harris added 26 points and 12 assists but Orlando didn't get much from anyone else and it made a huge impact against a playoff hungry Miami team. Orlando had no answer for Hassan Whiteside and his play was the difference in the battle of Florida. After a three game win streak in early April, the Magic have lost three straight.  Orlando will wrap up another disappointing season against the Brooklyn Nets, as the playoff-hopeful Heat end their season against the 76ers in Philadelphia on Wednesday. 											",Miami,Heat,Orlando,Magic,AmericanAirlines Arena,25,56,36,45,3.0,10.0,39.0,83.0,19.0,23.0,50.0,21.0,13.0,6.0,21.0,35.0,85.0,17.0,28.0,41.0,14.0,8.0,Luol Deng,10.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,39,Tobias Harris,12.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,11.0,15.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,40,Udonis Haslem,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Aaron Gordon,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,31,Hassan Whiteside,13.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,24.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Nikola Vucevic,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Dwyane Wade,4.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,22.0,8.0,21.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,33,Victor Oladipo,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,30.0,10.0,23.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,42,Goran Dragic,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,38,Elfrid Payton,1.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37,Mario Chalmers,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,20,Maurice Harkless,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,19,James Ennis III,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Willie Green,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,20,Chris Andersen,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Dewayne Dedmon,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Michael Beasley,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,8,Andrew Nicholson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4,Tyler Johnson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Channing Frye,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,12

												The New Orleans Pelicans (44-37) beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-65) 100-88 on Monday.Anthony Davis had a special game, in which he led his team in all five major statistical categories. He had 24 points, 11 rebounds, five assists, six blocks and two steals in a do-it-all performance. His play brought his team to the winner's circle with a much needed victory to keep his team ahead of the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference playoff race. The Pelicans have the same record as the Thunder, but hold the tie-breaker and would be admitted into the playoffs if the teams wind up with identical records.The Timberwolves had a rough second quarter and couldn't quite climb out of the hole against New Orleans. They went into halftime down by 15 after trailing the Pelicans by two heading into the second. Zach LeVine led Minnesota with 24 points and seven assists to go along with five rebounds for the rookie. Decimated by injuries, the Timberwolve's frontcourt was manned heavily by Justin Hamilton, Adreian Payne and Arinze Onuaku. Those three combined for 18 points and 12 rebounds. Chase Budinger and Robbie Hummel helped pick up the slack. They had 29 points, 18 rebounds and five assists combined. Minnesota needs a win and a New York Knicks loss to avoid being the sole team with the worst record in the NBA this season.Minnesota will end their rebuilding year in Oklahoma City against the Thunder, as the Pelicans will travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Wednesday. Each game has massive playoff implications. The Thunder need a win and a Pelicans loss. If the Pelicans win they secure the eighth seed. However, the Spurs are playing for the second seed in the Western Conference and likely won't rest their star players. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,New Orleans,Pelicans,Target Center,44,37,16,65,,,,,,,,,,6.0,21.0,37.0,84.0,20.0,24.0,39.0,15.0,9.0,Andrew Wiggins,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,44,Quincy Pondexter,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,24,Adreian Payne,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Anthony Davis,11.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,24.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Justin Hamilton,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,27,Omer Asik,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Chase Budinger,8.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,30,Eric Gordon,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,29,Zach LaVine,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,24.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,45,Tyreke Evans,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,31,Robbie Hummel,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,32,Alexis Ajinca,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Lorenzo Brown,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,24,Dante Cunningham,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,23,Arinze Onuaku,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Norris Cole,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,19,Anthony Bennett,,,,,,,,,,,,Ryan Anderson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,18,Gorgui Dieng,,,,,,,,,,,,Toney Douglas,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,15

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (44-37) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (51-30) 101-90 on Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.The Thunder were able to keep their playoff hopes alive with the win over the Blazers. The New Orleans Pelicans also came out with a win on Monday, so both the Thunder and Pelicans remain tied for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West. The Pelicans own the tiebreaker though, so in order for the Thunder to get into the playoffs, they'll need a win of their own, as well as a Pelican's loss on Wednesday in the finale. The Trail Blazers, on the other hand, have locked up the fourth seed in the West. It's still up in the air who they'll end up having to play, but it could be either the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies or Los Angeles Clippers.  Despite finishing with worse shooting percentages than the Blazers, the Thunder came out with a huge advantage on the boards, out-rebounding them 58-35. It was the duo of Enes Kanter and Russell Westbrook who helped keep the Thunder in playoff contention. Westbrook went 13-for-27 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 36 points, to go along with 11 rebounds and seven assists. He's been absolutely phenomenal throughout the whole second half of this season and he continues to put all the pressure on his own shoulders here in the final stretch, as he's averaging a ridiculous 39.0 points, 6.7 rebounds and 7.3 assists over his last three games. Kanter, on the other hand, finished with 27 points (13-20 FG, 1-2 FT) and 13 rebounds over 36 minutes. Kanter has scored over 20 points in five of his last seven games, a seven-game stretch where he's averaging 21.3 points. Dion waiters (4-21 FG, 0-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and Anthony Morrow (4-10 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 1-2 FT) were the only other two players in double figures with 13 and 11 points respectively. Already heavily hit by the injury bug, this was another damaging game for the Blazers, as both Nicolas Batum and C.J. McCollum had to leave the game with injuries. McCollum went down with a nasty looking ankle injury, while Batum's leg appeared to buckle as he went down with a knee injury. It's an awful amount of bad luck for this Trail Blazers' team, who could now go into the playoffs very shorthanded. With Aldridge also sitting this game out due to a foot injury, it was Meyers Leonard who led this team while in the starting lineup. Leonard posted a season-high of 24 points (9-17 FG, 5-9 3Pt, 1-1 FT), while also adding four rebounds and a blocked shot over 32 minutes. He'll go into the season finale averaging 5.6 points and 4.5 rebounds in his second season as a pro. Damian Lillard didn't have his best showing of the season, posting just 10 points (3-9 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and six assists in the loss. After going off for 28 points in Saturday's game against the Jazz, it was a disappointing performance for Lillard, who will need to play much better in the playoffs if the Blazers want any shot at making it past the first round. Joel Freeland added 16 points (8-13 FG) and five rebounds off the bench, while Chris Kaman chipped in with 14 points (7-9 FG) and four rebounds.      The Thunder's final game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, while the Trail Blazers will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Wednesday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Portland,Trail Blazers,Chesapeake Energy Arena,51,30,44,37,,,,,,,,,,8.0,23.0,38.0,83.0,6.0,9.0,35.0,22.0,12.0,Andre Roberson,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,21,Nicolas Batum,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,Enes Kanter,13.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,13.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,35,Meyers Leonard,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,24.0,9.0,17.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,32,Steven Adams,10.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,35,Robin Lopez,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Dion Waiters,7.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,21.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,39,CJ McCollum,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,19,Russell Westbrook,11.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,36.0,13.0,27.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,38,Damian Lillard,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,26,Anthony Morrow,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,31,Chris Kaman,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,15,Nick Collison,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,24,Allen Crabbe,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,36,D.J.

												The Utah Jazz (38-43) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (49-32) 109-92 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City. This loss didn't mean much for the Mavericks' spot in the playoffs, as they've already been locked in as the seventh seed in the West. They have yet to find out who they're playing though, as they could end up against the likes of the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Clippers or Memphis Grizzlies. The Jazz have been eliminated from playoff contention, but the win marks their second in a row, as they'll try and close the season with a strong finish, giving them plenty of momentum heading into next season. The Jazz saw a very impressive performance from Rudy Gobert. Gobert went 9-for-16 from the field and 2-for-3 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while also notching a monster 17 rebounds and three blocked shots. The double-double was his third over his last four games, a stretch where he's averaging 13.0 points, 13.0 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. In just the fourteenth game of his career, rookie Bryce Cotton went off for a career-high of 21 points (8-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four assists in 26 minutes off the bench. He had only reach double figures in points twice before, so it was good to see him have success while being given the opportunity to have an extended amount of minutes. Joe Ingles was in the starting lineup with both Derrick Favors and Gordon Hayward sitting out. He went 6-for-9 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 15 points in 27 minutes. Averaging just 4.9 points on the season, it was another nice surprise for the Jazz. Trevor Booker chipped in with a 13-point (5-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT), 12-rebound double-double as well. The Mavericks held out Monta Ellis, Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler for this game. Because of that, it was J.J. Barea who came out and took the lead for this team. He went 8-for-15 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 18 points while coming off the bench. The guard matched a season-high in field goal attempts, as he saw extended time with those other players being rested. Amar'e Stoudemire had a strong showing while running with the starting lineup. Over 22 minutes, he finished with 15 points (7-11 FG, 1-4 FT) and three rebounds. Both Rajon Rondo and Charlie Villanueva were the other starters to reach double figures. Rondo recorded 13 points (4-6 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five assists, while Villanueva added 15 points (6-13 FG, 3-6 3Pt) and four rebounds.  The Jazz's season will come to an end on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Dallas,Mavericks,Vivint Smart Home Arena,49,32,38,43,11.0,28.0,41.0,82.0,12.0,16.0,46.0,24.0,13.0,9.0,20.0,34.0,81.0,14.0,21.0,41.0,18.0,16.0,Joe Ingles,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,26,Richard Jefferson,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,17,Trevor Booker,12.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,30,Charlie Villanueva,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,22,Rudy Gobert,17.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,20.0,9.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Amar'e Stoudemire,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Rodney Hood,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,27,Rajon Rondo,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,31,Dante Exum,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,27,Raymond Felton,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,36,Chris Johnson,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,22,Al-Farouq Aminu,10.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,28,Jeremy Evans,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Bernard James,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Bryce Cotton,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,26,Devin Harris,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Elijah Millsap,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,J.J.

												The Sacramento Kings (28-53) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (21-60) 102-92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. With both teams already eliminated from the playoffs, this game was more about getting a look at players in anticipation of next season. It also cemented the Lakers with the fourth worst record in the league, meaning they'll have the fourth best odds to win the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. The Kings won this game in the fourth quarter, where they went on a huge run to out-score the Lakers 27-18. The Kings also secured the shooting advantage, finishing at 49 percent from the field, while the Lakers ended at 42 percent. With DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay being shut down for the rest of the season, Omri Casspi continued to take over as the leader of this team. He went off for a game-high of 26 points (7-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 10-13 FT), while nearly notching a triple-double with nine rebounds and six assists as well. Over his last five games, he's averaging an impressive 22.0 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists. Coming off the bench, Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well. He went 6-for-12 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score 20 points over 29 minutes. Like Casspi, he's been relied upon to pick up the slack without Cousins and Gay, as he's averaged 16.4 points over his last five games. Jason Thompson came up with a 10-point (4-8 FG, 2-4 FT), 10-rebound double-double, while also recording three blocked shots. It marked the third time over his last four games reaching double-digit rebounds. Both Carl Landry and Ray McCallum reached double figures as well. Landry had 14 points (5-7 FG, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds over 19 minutes, while McCallum added 12 points (5-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five rebounds over 28 minutes. Rookie Jordan Clarkson was again one of the few Lakers to have some success. He went 10-for-21 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 23 points, to go along with five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Clarkson has already earned himself a role for this team next year, but he continues to improve his numbers late in the season, averaging 21.6 points and 7.2 assists over his last five games. Jabari Brown also played well in the loss, finishing with 18 points (6-17 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and seven assists over 46 minutes. It marked his third straight game with 18 points or more, as he's pushed his season averages to 10.8 points and 2.1 assists over 18 games with the Lakers. The only other Laker in double figures was Jordan Hill. Hill posted 18 points (9-19 FG) of his own, while adding six rebounds and four assists. The Lakers had only seven players available for this game, as they are dealing with a ton of injuries. These two teams will play each other again on Wednesday in each team's final game of the season.

												The Golden State Warriors (66-15) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (54-27) 111-107 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. Already having locked up the number one overall seed in the Western Conference, the Warriors gained even more momentum against a very tough Grizzlies' team. The Warriors shot the ball extremely well, going 52 percent from the field and 54 percent from the three-point line, while the Grizzlies finished at 42 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep. This marks a tough loss for the Grizzlies, as they will likely be out of the running for the number two overall seed for the playoffs. With that being said, they will move down to the sixth seed and fall a half game behind the San Atonio Spurs, Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers, who all came up with victories on Monday. The Warriors can thank Klay Thompson for this victory, as he was unstoppable all night long. He went a ridiculous 15-for-21 from the field and 8-for-10 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 42 points, while also adding six rebounds and three assists as well. If Thompson and Stephen Curry both get hot for the playoffs, this team will be very tough to beat. Thompson is averaging 30.3 points over his last three games, while also hitting at least three three-pointers in each of those outings, so he's well on his way to hitting his groove with the playoffs starting Saturday. Curry, on the other hand, was the only other Warrior's player to reach double figures in points. He finished with 15 points and eight assists, while shooting 6-for-10 from the floor and 3-for-6 from deep. Curry is shooting unbelievably well right now. He's finished over 50 percent from the field in each of his last five games, while shooting over 45 percent from the three-point line in those five games as well. Arguably the current leader in the MVP race, Curry is averaging 24.0 points and 7.7 assists on the season, as he'll look to take his hot shooting into the postseason.Along with holding Mike Conley out of this game, the Grizzlies also limited the minutes of their starters, as Beno Udrih was the only starter to play over 22 minutes. Because of that, it was the bench that did the majority of the work for the Grizzlies. Rookie Jordan Adams came out of nowhere to score a career-high of 19 points (6-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 5-7 FT) in 21 minutes off the bench. He had only reach double-digit points in two other games this season and only averages 2.5 points per game, so it was a very nice surprise for this team. Russ Smith also had a very surprising performance off the bench. He went 5-for-8 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 16 points. He did it in only 10 minutes of action, which made it all the more impressive. Zach Randolph was the only starter in double figures, as he posted 10 points (3-7 FG, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds over 21 minutes. The Warriors' final game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday, while the Grizzlies will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (55-26) defeated the Denver Nuggets (30-51) 110-103 on Monday.The Clippers got superstar performances from their superstar players against the Nuggets. Blake Griffin and Chris Paul both nearly had triple-doubles. Griffin had 22 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, while Paul put up 17 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. Big man DeAndre Jordan also posted 20 points, 21 rebounds and four blocks for his fourth game of 20 or more points and 20 or more rebounds on the season. The Clippers hope to improve their playoff status when they take on the Suns on Tuesday. Los Angeles has locked up a playoff birth but can still improve their seeding in the Western Conference standings.The Nuggets nearly upset the Clippers behind a solid game by Wilson Chandler. He scored a game-high 32 points to go along with six rebounds before fouling out. Kenneth Faried came close to matching Jordan's 20-20 performance, but came up a little shy with 19 points and 17 rebounds. Denver will end their season on Wednesday when they take on the NBA's top team, the Golden State Warriors.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (40-40) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (47-43) 96-73 on Sunday in Milwaukee.After holding just a two point lead after the first half, the Bucks used a monster second half to turn this game into a route, outscoring the Nets by 12 in the third period and nine in the fourth. The victory not only brought Milwaukee back to .500, but it also clinched them a playoff birth after holding the worst record in the NBA last season. Ersan Ilyasova led the way for the Bucks, scoring 21 points (8-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt), 11 of which came in the third quarter, and grabbing five rebounds in 28 minutes. This comes after Ilyasova scored just eight points in his previous two outings combined. Khris Middleton scored 16 points on 7-of-11 shooting to along with seven assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes of action. Giannis Antetokounmpo was not far behind, recording 13 points on 6-of-14 shooting, nine rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes. O.J. Mayo scored 17 points (6-13 FG, 3-5 3Pt) in 20 minutes off the bench, while Michael Carter-Williams scored 12 to round out the five Milwaukee players who scored in double figures.The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end.The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half-game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule.Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double-double of 12 points (3-8 FG, 6-7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. Off the bench, both Mason Plumlee and Jarrett Jack scored 11 points in 17 and 24 minutes respectively. Deron Williams struggled mightily shooting the ball, going just 1-for-11 from the field en route to scoring just four points in 33 minutes. He was, however, able to record seven assists and seven rebounds. As a team, the Nets shot a dreadful 32.5 percent from the field and 16.7 percent from three, all while recording 21 turnovers to just 17 assists.Up next, the Bucks will travel to Philadelphia Monday to take on the 76ers, while the Nets head home to Chicago Monday to play the Bulls with their playoff hopes in the balance. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Brooklyn,Nets,Fiserv Forum,37,43,40,40,6.0,20.0,38.0,77.0,7.0,10.0,45.0,29.0,16.0,3.0,18.0,25.0,80.0,16.0,22.0,45.0,17.0,20.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,9.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,30,Joe Johnson,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,34,Ersan Ilyasova,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,27,Thaddeus Young,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,28,Zaza Pachulia,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Brook Lopez,10.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Khris Middleton,4.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,30,Markel Brown,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Michael Carter-Williams,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Deron Williams,7.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,32,Jared Dudley,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,28,Bojan Bogdanovic,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,25,O.J.

												The Boston Celtics (38-42) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (51-29) 117-78 on Sunday in Boston.This was the second game in a row where the Celtics played the Cavaliers and the second in a row where they emerged victorious. This time, however, Cleveland sat most of its star players, including LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Nevertheless, Boston took advantage, dominating their opponent for the final three quarters, starting with a 34-9 thrashing in the second period.Seven Boston players scored in double figures, with Isaiah Thomas leading the way off the bench, scoring 17 points (5-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and dishing out six assists in just 22 minutes. Evan Turner also put together a solid performance, posting 15 points (6-12 FG), seven rebounds, five assists and four steals in 27 minutes. Avery Bradley (12) and Tyler Zeller (10) each reached double figures as starters, while Jared Sullinger (11), Kelly Olynyk (10) and Jonas Jerebko (10) each were in double figures off the bench.The Celtics recorded 20 steals and forced 24 turnovers in total, and the win leaves them as the No. 7 in the Eastern Conference. With just two games left to play, they hold a two-game lead over the eighth-place Nets. Cleveland has nothing but pride to play for at this point, as they are locked into the No. 2 seed in the East. With majority of their starters resting, Iman Shumpert lead the way in the starting lineup, recording a double-double of 15 points (6-15 FG) and 10 rebounds in 38 minutes. Tristan Thompson (15) was the only other starter to score in double figures, while James Jones scored 14 points (4-7 FG) in 26 minutes off the bench.Up next, the Celtics will stay home Tuesday to take on the Raptors, while the Cavaliers will head home on Monday to play the Pistons.

												The Detroit Pistons (31-49) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33-47) 116-77 on Sunday in Detroit.The Pistons opened up the game strong, starting on a 12-2 run in the first six minutes and winning the first quarter 30-10. From there on out, they never lost control. Jodie Meeks led the way scoring for Detroit, posting a game-high 24 points on 8-of-12 shooting in 27 minutes off the bench. After a rough stretch to start the month, Meeks has picked up his production off the bench as of late, averaging 17.3 points in his last three outings.Andre Drummond posted a monster double-double in the winning effort of 15 points (7-12 FG) and 19 rebounds in 32 minutes, while Greg Monroe came up a rebound shy of a double-double of his own, posting 17 points (4-10 FG. 9-10 FT), nine rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes. Reggie Jackson struggled shooting the ball, going just 1-of-7 from the field and scoring five points, but he was still able to dish out 13 assists in 30 minutes. The Pistons recorded an efficient 33 assists on 41 made field goals to just 14 turnovers and outrebounded the Hornets 56-33.At one point, Charlotte was well in the playoff race, but have consistently fallen towards the bottom of the Eastern Conference since then. Four players scored in double figures, with Noah Vonleh leading the way in one of his best performances of the season, scoring 16 points (6-11 FG) and 12 rebounds in 29 minutes off the bench. Gerald Hendersen was not far behind, scoring 14 points on 6-of-16 shooting in 26 minutes, while Brian Roberts (11) and Jeff Taylor (10) round out the four Hornets who scored in double figures. Kemba Walker had a very poor shooting performance, going just 2-of-11 from the field and recording seven points and seven assists in 31 minutes. Up next, the Pistons will head to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Monday, while the Hornets will travel back home Monday to go up against the Rockets.  											",Detroit,Pistons,Charlotte,Hornets,Little Caesars Arena,33,47,31,49,16.0,28.0,40.0,79.0,17.0,21.0,55.0,31.0,14.0,4.0,15.0,27.0,79.0,19.0,29.0,33.0,16.0,9.0,Caron Butler,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,Jeffery Taylor,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Greg Monroe,9.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,17.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Marvin Williams,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,19,Andre Drummond,19.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Bismack Biyombo,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,28,Gerald Henderson,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Reggie Jackson,4.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,29,Kemba Walker,1.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,Anthony Tolliver,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,19,Noah Vonleh,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,28,Jodie Meeks,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,27,PJ Hairston,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,13,Quincy Miller,4.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,26,Jason Maxiell,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,John Lucas III,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,18,Troy Daniels,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,28,Shawne Williams,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,8,Brian Roberts,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,19

												The Denver Nuggets (30-50) defeated the Sacramento Kings (27-53) 122-111 on Sunday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. The Nuggets finished as the superior shooters in this game, going 56 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 51 percent from the floor and just 28 percent from deep. The Nuggets also came out with the advantage on the boards, out-rebounding the Kings 43-32. While it was a high scoring game, both teams were quite sloppy with the ball, as the Nuggets recorded 18 turnovers and the Kings finished with 20. Kenneth Faried had another excellent showing as the Nuggets continued to use their small lineup with him at the center position. Faried went an impressive 12-for-14 from the field and 6-for-8 from the free throw line to score a game-high of 30 points, while also chipping in with seven rebounds and three steals. He's really picked up his play of late and is averaging 24.3 points and 5.7 rebounds over his last three games. Wilson Chandler also did his part in the win as well and finished with 21 points (8-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), nine rebounds and three steals. He's put in two solid performances in a row now, combining for 41 points and 20 rebounds during that stretch. He's now averaging 13.5 points and 6.1 rebounds on the year. Despite struggling with his shot, Randy Foye still posted 16 points (3-11 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and two steals over 29 minutes. He has shot below 40 percent from the field in three of his last four games, so he'll look to build on those percentages with the regular season winding down. With scoring leaders DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay still sitting out, it was Ben McLemore and Omri Casspi who did the bulk of the work offensively. Casspi nearly triple-doubled with 22 points (8-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-8 FT), seven rebounds and seven assists, while McLemore finished with 20 points (6-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 6-8 FT), seven assists and four steals. Casspi has taken it on himself to make up for the Kings' injury issues of late, as he's now averaging 21.0 points and 5.5 rebounds over his last four games. McLemore has struggled with his consistency all season long, so it's also a very positive sign for the Kings that he's recorded three solid performances in a row. Ray McCallum shot the ball well Sunday, going 6-for-10 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 14 points, while also adding three assists. He's been on fire the last two games, combining to go 14-for-21 from from the field and 2-for-4 from deep during that span.  The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday, while the Kings will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Sacramento,Kings,Pepsi Center,27,53,30,50,9.0,25.0,42.0,77.0,23.0,30.0,38.0,30.0,17.0,5.0,18.0,38.0,74.0,30.0,42.0,32.0,28.0,20.0,Wilson Chandler,9.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,30,Omri Casspi,7.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,34,Danilo Gallinari,6.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,34,Derrick Williams,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,29,Kenneth Faried,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,30.0,12.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,30,Jason Thompson,5.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Randy Foye,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,3.0,11.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,29,Ben McLemore,5.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,20.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,37,Ty Lawson,0.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,36,Ray McCallum,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,29,JJ Hickson,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Carl Landry,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Will Barton,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,17,Ryan Hollins,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Jusuf Nurkic,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,11,Andre Miller,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Erick Green,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8,Nik Stauskas,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,21,Gary Harris,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,13,David Stockton,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

												The Indiana Pacers (37-43) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (43-37) 116-104 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. While Russell Westbrook did everything he could to bring the Thunder back in this game, he just didn't get enough help in the end, as the Thunder took the loss. This was a tough defeat for the Thunder, as it pushes them to a half-game back from the New Orleans Pelicans for the final projected playoff spot in the West. The Pelicans play the Houston Rockets on Sunday as well, so they could extend their lead to a full game. The Pacers, on the other hand, remain alive in the East with their fifth straight win. They're now even with the Brooklyn Nets for the final playoff spot in the East, although the Nets hold the tie breaker over them, so they'll likely need to win their last two games in order to pass up the Nets. It was C.J. Miles who came up with the huge night on Sunday. He went 9-for-14 from the field and 6-for-8 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 30 points, while also posting 10 rebounds. It was his second impressive performance in a row, as he's combined for 54 points and 15 rebounds over his last two games. The 10 rebounds were a new season-high, with the double-double marking his first of the season. Notching a double-double of his own was Roy Hibbert, who finished with 17 points (7-12 FG, 3-4 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. The double-double was his third in a row, a stretch where he's averaging 12.7 points and 10.7 rebounds per game. Including some clutch buckets during the final few minutes of the game, George Hill added 19 points (6-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and seven assists over 40 minutes. He shot just 2-of-6 from the field in Friday's game against the Pistons, so the guard was able to get pointed back in the right direction Sunday. Westbrook did everything he could to try and pick up the win for the Thunder. Westbrook took nearly half of the teams' total shot attempts in this one, recording a ridiculous 43 field goal attempts, while converting on 21 of them. He finished with a monster line of 54 points (21-43 FG, 5-15 3Pt, 7-11 FT), nine rebounds and eight assists over 40 minutes, but he just didn't get enough help from his teammates to convert those impressive numbers into a win. Westbrook has combined for 81 points over his last two games alone. Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter were the only other two Thunder players to reach double figures in points. Waiters posted 16 points (7-16 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 0-4 FT) and two rebounds, while Kanter recorded 13 points (5-11 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT), five rebounds and a block. The Thunder received only 14 points from their bench.The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,43,37,37,43,10.0,20.0,40.0,76.0,22.0,35.0,49.0,23.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Solomon Hill,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Andre Roberson,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,23,David West,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,22,Enes Kanter,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,32,Roy Hibbert,10.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,17.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Steven Adams,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,CJ Miles,10.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,30.0,9.0,14.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,35,Dion Waiters,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,16.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,39,George Hill,3.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,39,Russell Westbrook,9.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,54.0,21.0,43.0,5.0,15.0,2.0,40,Paul George,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,14,Nick Collison,8.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Ian Mahinmi,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Anthony Morrow,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,28,Rodney Stuckey,7.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,Mitch McGary,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Luis Scola,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,D.J.

												The Washington Wizards (46-34) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (60-20) 108-99 on Sunday in Washington. It was a game where neither team had much to play for, as the Hawks are locked in as the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Wizards are locked in as the No. 5 seed. The only difference Sunday night was that Atlanta rested their starters, while Washington played at full strength. After sitting out to rest the previous two games, All-Star John Wall returned for the Wizards to put up 24 points (9-20 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT), nine assists and four rebounds in 35 minutes. He did, however, have a game-high 10 turnovers. Nene Hilario shook off a rough stretch of play he has had as of late to record a double-double of 14 points and 10 rebounds in 27 minutes, while Marcin Gortat felt one rebound shy of putting up a double-double of his own, posting 15 points and nine rebounds in 32 minutes. Bradley Beal scored 17 points and Paul Pierce added 14, putting every Washington starter in double figures. The game was won on the boards, as Washington dominated down low, outrebounding Atlanta 51-38.Despite resting their regular starters, the Hawks still put together a solid performance. Mike Scott led the way for them off the bench, scoring 19 points (6-15 FG, 3-7 3Pt) in 30 minutes. John Jenkins was close behind, scoring 17 points (6-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt) in 35 minutes. Dennis Schroder got the start and put up 14 points (6-16 FG), six rebounds and three assists in 29 minutes. Shelvin Mack came off the bench to run the show and put up 14 points (5-12 FG), six assists and four rebounds in 26 minutes. Up next, the Wizards will travel to Indiana Tuesday to take on the Pacers, while Atlanta heads back home Monday to play the Knicks.  											",Washington,Wizards,Atlanta,Hawks,Capital One Arena,60,20,46,34,9.0,21.0,39.0,85.0,21.0,27.0,51.0,22.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,Paul Pierce,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,29,Kent Bazemore,6.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,28,Nene,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,27,Elton Brand,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Marcin Gortat,9.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Mike Muscala,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,27,Bradley Beal,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,17.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,37,John Jenkins,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,35,John Wall,4.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,24.0,9.0,20.0,2.0,4.0,10.0,35,Dennis Schroder,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,28,Drew Gooden,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,20,Shelvin Mack,4.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,26,Otto Porter Jr.,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,25,Mike Scott,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,15.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,29,Ramon Sessions,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Pero Antic,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,18,Kris Humphries,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Austin Daye,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,25,Kevin Seraphin,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,DeMarre Carroll,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Houston Rockets (54-26) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (43-37) 121-114 on Sunday in Houston. The Pelicans found themselves with the lead for majority of the game, but then the Rockets kicked it up a notch towards the end of the third period and were able to hold onto their lead for the remainder of the game. MVP-candidate James Harden lead the way for the Rockets on Sunday, scoring 30 points (10-18 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 9-9 FT) and dishing out 7 assists in 38 minutes. It was Harden's third 30-point game of the month. Corey Brewer provided a huge spark off the bench for Houston that helped them keep their lead, as he scored 20 points (6-11 FG, 8-11 FT) in just 29 minutes off the bench. Dwight Howard posted his third consecutive double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds in 28 minutes and also hit some key free throws down the stretch when New Orleans was intentionally fouling him.The game was won on the fast break, as the Rockets scored 21 fast break points compared to zero for the Pelicans, and the win pushed Houston into a tie in the Western Conference with the Grizzlies and Clippers. However, the Rockets are losing the tiebreaker to both teams.New Orleans missed out on an opportunity to advance a game ahead of the Thunder in the playoff chase in the West, but even with the loss and owning the tiebreaker over Oklahoma City, the Pelicans are still in the playoffs as of today. All five New Orleans starters scored in double figures with Anthony Davis leading the way. Davis scored 27 points (10-16 FG, 7-10 FT) and grabbed seven rebounds in 40 minutes of play. Jrue Holiday played in his second game since returning from a leg injury and scored a very efficient 17 points (7-9 FG, 3-3 3Pt) in 15 minutes off the bench. Ryan Anderson also made strong contributions off the bench, scoring 15 points (6-13 FG, 2-7 FT), all of which came in the first half, in 27 minutes. Omer Asik (13), Eric Gordon (13), Quincy Pondexter (13) and Tyreke Evans (12) round out the seven Pelicans players who scored in double figures. Up next, the Rockets will travel to Charlotte Monday to take on the collapsing Hornets, while New Orleans will head to Minnesota and play the Timberwolves on Monday. 											",Houston,Rockets,New Orleans,Pelicans,Toyota Center,43,37,54,26,,,,,,,,,,11.0,27.0,44.0,91.0,15.0,22.0,39.0,22.0,10.0,Trevor Ariza,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,38,Quincy Pondexter,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,33,Terrence Jones,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Anthony Davis,7.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,27.0,10.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,39,Dwight Howard,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,19.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Omer Asik,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,James Harden,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,10.0,18.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,37,Eric Gordon,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,32,Jason Terry,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,24,Tyreke Evans,5.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,39,Joey Dorsey,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Ryan Anderson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,27,Josh Smith,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,26,Norris Cole,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12,Corey Brewer,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,29,Jrue Holiday,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,15,Pablo Prigioni,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,24,Dante Cunningham,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Clint Capela,,,,,,,,,,,,Alexis Ajinca,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

												The San Antonio Spurs (55-26) defeated the Phoenix Suns (39-42) 107-91 on Sunday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio. The Spurs continued their unbelievable stretch, winning their eleventh game in a row and propelling themselves into the second spot in the Western Conference standings. After many had criticized the defending champs for their slow start to the season, the Spurs have made them eat their words, as they now own a half game lead over the Clippers, Grizzlies and Rockets for that second projected playoff seed. The Spurs were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Suns finished at 41 percent from the floor and just 25 percent from deep. It was the Spurs' frontcourt duo of Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard that helped seal the victory Sunday. Duncan finished with 22 points (7-11 FG, 8-9 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots, while playing just 26 minutes. It was a very efficient showing for the veteran, who's posted two double-doubles in a row. During that two-game stretch, he's combined for 51 points and 20 rebounds, so Duncan is doing a great job of building even more momentum for himself as they head into the playoffs. Leonard, on the other hand, went 6-for-12 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 18 points, to go along with nine rebounds. He's had a fantastic span of games throughout April, averaging 19.8 points over seven games. He's also done it defensively though, posting three or more steals in four out of those seven games as well. The Spurs received some solid contributions off their bench. Cory Joseph had 13 points (5-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds over 19 minutes, while Marco Belinelli posted 13 points (4-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and four assists over 24 minutes. Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green were the only two Suns' players that really had any success against the Spurs' defense. Bledsoe notched a double-double with 20 points (7-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and 10 assists. He's now combined for 39 points and 17 assists over his last three games. Green, on the other hand, went 8-for-16 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 23 points, while also adding four rebounds over 26 minutes. Over his last five games, he's now averaging 19.4 points, as he's been one of the few bright spots for the Suns. Markieff Morris and Archie Goodwin were the only other two players to reach double figures. Morris finished with 12 points (4-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five rebounds, while Goodwin recorded 11 points (5-15 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four rebounds.    The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Suns will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (49-31) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (21-59) 120-106 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.It was another nice victory for the Mavericks, who have now extended their winning streak to three straight games. They're already locked in as the seventh seed in the Western Conference standings, so they'll look to continue to build their momentum with the playoffs on the verge of beginning. The Lakers have been eliminated from the playoffs for quite some time now, but the loss only helps their cause, as a worse record increases the potential for a higher landing spot for the 2015 NBA Draft. With the fourth worst record in the league, it's almost a sure thing they'll get a very high pick come draft day. The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this game, going 54 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers finished at 44 percent from the floor and 38 percent from deep.It was Tyson Chandler who surprisingly led the team in scoring. He went 9-for-10 from the field and 2-for-4 from the free throw line to score a team-high of 20 points, while also adding nine rebounds and two blocked shots. The Lakers were just too young and inexperienced in their frontcourt, as Chandler was able to have a field day. It was just the fourth time all season that he reached the 20-point mark, so it was easily one of his best offensive performances of the year. Richard Jefferson also gave a solid contribution. In 27 minutes as a starter, he finished with 17 points (4-7 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 7-9 FT) and three rebounds. He's shot very well over his last two games and has combined for 41 points during that span, so he'll look to keep his confidence high going into the playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki was the third starter in double figures, as he recorded 16 points (5-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four rebounds. He's now averaging 19.4 points over his last seven games. Coming off the bench, Charlie Villanueva added 14 points (5-11 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four rebounds, while Raymond Felton chipped in with 15 points (7-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and three assists.The Lakers production was very spread out through their lineup Sunday, with seven players reaching double-digit points. Jordan Clarkson led the way, finishing with a game-high of 26 points (9-19 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 5-5 FT), to go along with six assists and two steals. The rookie has been a very nice surprise for the Lakers so far this season, as he's averaged 21.3 points and 7.5 assists over his last four games. Clarkson received some help from Wesley Johnson though. Johnson went 6-for-9 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score an efficient 16 points over 20 minutes. He had shot below 40 percent from the field in four out of his last five games coming into Sunday, so it was good to see him finally have some better success in this one. While it wasn't his best game shooting the ball, Jabari Brown still posted 18 points (4-13 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 8-9 FT) and two assists over 42 minutes. He's combined for 38 points and nine assists over his last two games, moving his season averages to 9.9 points and 1.8 assists over 17 games with the Lakers.The Lakers' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Monday, while the Kings will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Monday.

												The New York Knicks (16-64) escaped with an 80-79 win over the Orlando Magic (25-55). Tim Hardaway hit the game-winning three-pointer with 12.6 seconds remaining. Both teams combined to score 15 points in the second quarter, an NBA record for the lowest scoring quarter in the shot-clock era. The Knicks won the quarter 8-7. The win snapped a two-game losing streak, giving the Knicks a half game lead over the Minnesota Timberwolves for worst record in the league. By night’s end, both teams could be tied if the Timberwolves lose to the NBA’s best team, the Golden State Warriors. The Knicks lost the season series to the Timberwolves, giving them pole position for best draft lottery odds. Tim Hardaway scored the team’s final seven points. He and rookie Langston Galloway each shot 4-of-16 from the floor. Cole Aldrich scored 14 points in the first eight minutes and concluded with a career-high 19 points and 14 rebounds in 26 minutes. Cleanthony Early played a team-low 15 minutes in his return to the lineup, missing the previous three games due to an ankle sprain.The Magic fell to 5-7 when wearing sleeved jerseys. They have the fifth worst record in the league, two and half games behind the sixth worst team, the Sacramento Kings. Elfrid Payton, Rookie of the Year candidate, snapped a streak of 10 consecutive made free throws, going 1-of-4 against the Knicks. He also added seven points, nine assists, two steals, one rebound and one block in 37 minutes. Nikola Vucevic entered the game averaging 27.3 points and 16.3 rebounds against the Knicks, yet only managed 12 points on 5-of-14 shooting and 13 rebounds. Victor Oladipo scored 21 points on 25 shots, converting 1-of-8 three-pointers, including two misses to tie the game in the final 10 seconds.

Harrison Barnes, the only Warrior to play every game this season, secured his sixth double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds in 29 minutes.The Timberwolves 10-game losing streak gives them the same record as the New York Knicks, both claiming the league’s worst record. Since they Wolves swept the season series, the Knicks hold the inside track for the best chance of landing the first overall selection. Both teams are two games better than the Philadelphia 76ers with two games remaining. Down to eight healthy players, the Wolves learned earlier in the day Ricky Rubio will have arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle early next week, essentially ending his season. Rookie of the Year frontrunner Andrew Wiggins supplied 17 points, a career-high nine assists, six rebounds, three steals, and one block in 44 minutes. He currently leads the NBA in minutes played, surpassing the Rockets’ James Harden by eight minutes for a total of 2,887. Fellow rookie Zach LaVine put on a performance of his own, scoring a career-high 37 points against the league's best defense. Kevin Martin, Justin Hamilton, and Chase Budinger all chipped in with 12 points each.The Warriors host the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday, a contest which will help clear up the top of the Western Conference playoff seeding. The Timberwolves begin a two-game homestand Monday against the Pelicans.

												The Toronto Raptors (47-32) defeated the Orlando Magic (25-54) 101-99 on Friday in Orlando.The game went back and forth until the final buzzer sounded. DeMar DeRozan put the Raptors up two with 18 seconds left, but then Victor Oladipo countered with a three-point bomb of his own to put the Magic up one point with 13 seconds remaining. Finally, it was Lou Williams who hit a three of his own with nine seconds left to give Toronto their two-point lead back.With four seconds left, down two points, the Magic had an opportunity to tie it or win the game, but Oladipo's jumper at the buzzer was just off, giving the Raptors the victory.DeRozan led the way for Toronto, recording a game-high 29 points (10-21 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 6-6 FT), five assists and three rebounds in 37 minutes. Tyler Hansbrough also filled in nicely once again for the injured Amir Johnson (ankle), scoring 16 points (7-12 FG) and grabbing 7 rebounds in 36 minutes.Lou Williams, in addition to hitting the game-winning shot, scored 13 points on 5-of-15 shooting, while Kyle Lowry (back) returned to the starting lineup after sitting the last seven games to post 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in 33 minutes. Terrence Ross left Friday's game with a sore left ankle and did not return.The win moves the Raptors into a tie for third place in the East, where they currently hold the tiebreaker over the Bulls with just three games left to play in the regular season. Oladipo led the way for the Magic in the losing effort, posting 19 points (8-18 FG), five rebounds and four assists in 43 minutes. Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic each scored 16 points, while Evan Fournier (18) and Aaron Gordon (13) combined to score 31 points off the bench. Up next, the Raptors will travel to Miami Saturday to play the Heat, while the Magic will stay at home and take on the Knicks on Saturday. 											",Orlando,Magic,Toronto,Raptors,Amway Center,47,32,25,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tobias Harris,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,8.0,15.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,32,Terrence Ross,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,20,Dewayne Dedmon,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Tyler Hansbrough,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35,Nikola Vucevic,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,Jonas Valanciunas,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Victor Oladipo,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,18.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,43,DeMar DeRozan,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,29.0,10.0,21.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,37,Elfrid Payton,6.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,34,Kyle Lowry,8.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,33,Aaron Gordon,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,24,Patrick Patterson,5.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,24,Evan Fournier,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,25,Greivis Vasquez,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,25,Willie Green,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,15,Lou Williams,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,27,Andrew Nicholson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Chuck Hayes,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Channing Frye,,,,,,,,,,,,Bruno Caboclo,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Atlanta Hawks (60-19) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33-46) 104-80 on Friday.It was just another balanced team performance from the Hawks. After going into halftime down by one, Atlanta came out strong and took care of business against the Hornets. They did it without leading scorer Paul Millsap, who was out with a shoulder injury. Mike Muscala didn't just step in to start at power forward for Millsap, he also did his best impression of his teammate. He led the Hawks with a game-high 17 points on 8-for-9 shooting from the field in just 25 minutes played. Atlanta has the Eastern Conference locked up, at this point they are hoping to stay healthy while they wait and see who they'll be matching up with in the first round. They're now 4-0 in April and they'll look to stay hot entering the playoffs.The Hornets went with a skeleton crew against Atlanta. Al Jefferson (knee), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (ankle), Lance Stephenson (toe) and Cody Zeller (ankle) all missed Friday's game with injuries. With a lot of the heavy lifters out, it was up to Kemba Walker to shoulder the load for Charlotte. Walker unfortunately didn't play his best game, finishing with just 10 points and six assists in 24 minutes. He got some help from Troy Daniels, but even his 15 points in 20 minutes off the bench wasn't enough to overcome the Eastern Conference's top team. Charlotte will host the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, as the Hawks will head to Washington D.C. to take on the Wizards.

												The Brooklyn Nets (37-42) defeated the Washington Wizards (45-34) 117-80 on Friday in Brooklyn.The Nets seized control of this game from the very start, opening up a 31-14 lead after the first quarter. They also ended the contest on a very strong note, winning the fourth quarter 42-18. Brook Lopez once again led the way for the Nets, as he continues to play his best basketball of the season. He had 26 points (12-22 FG) and nine rebounds, and in his last five games is averaging 25.0 points and 10.2 rebounds in his last five games. Bojan Bogdonavic was not far behind, scoring 22 points (7-12 FG, 6-6 3Pt) in 30 minutes off the bench. Jarrett Jack (14) and Thaddeus Young (10) were the only other Brooklyn players to score in double figures, and while he did not reach double figure scoring, Deron Williams still put together a solid stat line of nine points (3-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt), nine assists and seven rebounds in 31 minutes. The win, along with a Celtics win, leaves the Nets in a tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, but they are losing the tiebreaker to Boston. They currently hold a 1.5-game lead over the Pacers for that position with just three games left to play in the regular season.The Wizards rested John Wall for the second night in a row, as they do not have much to play for as the season winds down. Bradley Beal played well in the losing effort, scoring a team-high 24 points (10-19 FG, 3-4 3Pt), while Marcin Gortat recorded a monster double-double of 21 points (9-11 FG) and 16 rebounds. Ramon Sessions filled in for Wall once again, but struggled shooting the ball, going 1-for-7 from the field for two points to go along with 10 assists and seven rebounds.Even with the loss, Washington is sitting comfortably in fifth place in the East, and since they are unable to move up or down in the standings regardless of the outcomes for these final three games in the regular season. Up next, the Nets will head to Milwaukee Sunday to take on the Bucks, while the Wizards head home Sunday and play the East-leading Hawks. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Washington,Wizards,Barclays Center,45,34,37,42,11.0,19.0,44.0,87.0,13.0,21.0,42.0,28.0,6.0,5.0,13.0,29.0,73.0,8.0,13.0,44.0,21.0,15.0,Joe Johnson,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,27,Paul Pierce,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,20,Thaddeus Young,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,29,Nene,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Brook Lopez,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,12.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Marcin Gortat,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Markel Brown,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,28,Bradley Beal,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,10.0,19.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,32,Deron Williams,7.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,30,Ramon Sessions,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,34,Bojan Bogdanovic,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,12.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,29,Drew Gooden,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Jarrett Jack,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,19,Otto Porter Jr.,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,27,Cory Jefferson,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11,Rasual Butler,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Mason Plumlee,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Will Bynum,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,18,Darius Morris,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4,Kevin Seraphin,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,14

												The Boston Celtics (37-42) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (51-28) 99-90 on Friday in Cleveland.With the Cavaliers solidified as the No. 2 seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs, they did not try particularly hard to win this game, starting with sitting Kyrie Irving (hip) to make sure he stays healthy. Regardless, the Celtics took advantage, picking up a huge victory as they fight to stay in the playoffs. Marcus Smart led the way scoring for Boston, posting 19 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 34 minutes. Avery Bradley was close behind, scoring 15 points (7-12 FG) in 31 minutes. The Celtics starting frontcourt of Tyler Zeller and Brandon Bass combined to score 25 points and grab 11 rebounds. Boston's final starter, Evan Turner, struggled shooting the ball and only scored four points, but still managed to dish out 13 assists and grab six rebounds. Isaiah Thomas, as he has done so well since joining the Celtics, provided solid production off the bench, scoring 17 points (4-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt) in 23 minutes. The victory keeps Boston in the playoff chase, as they are tied with the Nets for the final playoff spot, but currently hold the tiebreaker. They are 2 games behind the Bucks for sixth place.For Cleveland this was essentially a night off, as both Lebron James and Kevin Love played less than their normal load of minutes and sat out during crunch time. James scored 14 points (5-14 FG, 0-5 3Pt) and dished out seven assists in 26 minutes, while Kevin Love scored 19 (6-12 FG, 4-8 3Pt) and grabbed six rebounds in 31 minutes.

												The Indiana Pacers (36-43) beat the Detroit Pistons (30-49) 107-103 on Friday.Rodney Stuckey and C.J. Miles each scored 24 points to lead Indiana past the Pistons. The game was tied going into the fourth quarter and came down to the wire, but point guard George Hill hit six straight free throws in the final 81 seconds to seal the victory for his playoff-hopeful Pacers. Indiana is one game behind the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics, who hold the final two playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. Both the Nets and Celtics won their games on Friday to keep their advantage over the Pacers. Indiana has won four straight, but face three teams with winning records in their final three games.Greg Monroe put up another solid performance in just his second game back after an 11-game absence because of a knee injury. He had 17 points, 12 rebounds and three assists. His point guard Reggie Jackson had a nice game, and like Monroe, is a free agent to be this offseason. Jackson had 21 points and nine assists. He's averaging 20.3 points and 10.8 assists in April. However the Pistons are 1-4 this month and have been eliminated from playoff competition.The Pistons will take on the Charlotte Hornets, as Indiana will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (39-40) defeated the New York Knicks (15-64) 99-91 on Friday in New York. It was rough for the Bucks in the first half, as they found themselves down by as much as six to the NBA's worst team. But they were able to kick it up a notch in the third quarter and outscore the Knicks by 13 in the period, and they were able to take care of business from there.Giannis Antetokounmpo was thrust back into the starting lineup after a DNP (coach's decision) in Milwaukee's last game, and he played very well, scoring 23 points (7-14 FG, 9-11 FT) and grabbing nine rebounds in 31 minutes. Khris Middleton was not far behind, posting 22 points (9-16 FG, 3-6 3Pt), seven rebounds and he was very active defensively with six steals in 35 minutes. Michael Carter-Williams also continued his strong play as of late, scoring 19 points (8-13 FG), seven assists and four steals in 31 minutes. In his last two games, Carter-Williams has now combined for 49 points and 15 assists. As a team, the Bucks recorded an astounding 17 steals, and the victory keeps them in sixth place in the Eastern Conference. For now, they sit there comfortably with a two-game lead for that position with just three games remaining in the regular season.The dreadful season for the Knicks continues, as this loss is their 11th in their last 12 games. Langston Galloway was once again solid in the losing effort, scoring 20 points on 8-of-16 shooting in 35 minutes. Four other New York players scored in double figures, with Lance Thomas (16), Shane Larkin (14), Jason Smith (11) and Lou Amundson (10) rounding out the five total. Andrea Bargnani sat out this game with an illness.The Knicks recorded a dreadful 24 turnovers to just 22 assists, and they continue to boast the worst record in the NBA this season.Up next, the Bucks will head home Sunday to take on the Nets, while the Knicks will travel to Orlando Saturday to play the Magic. 											",New York,Knicks,Milwaukee,Bucks,Madison Square Garden,39,40,15,64,,,,,,,,,,6.0,17.0,37.0,74.0,19.0,27.0,31.0,18.0,17.0,Quincy Acy,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,31,Giannis Antetokounmpo,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,23.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,31,Lance Thomas,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,35,Ersan Ilyasova,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,20,Cole Aldrich,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,13,Zaza Pachulia,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Langston Galloway,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,16.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,34,Michael Carter-Williams,1.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,31,Tim Hardaway Jr.,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,25,Khris Middleton,7.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,16.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,34,Lou Amundson,11.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,John Henson,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Shane Larkin,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,32,O.J.

												The San Antonio Spurs (54-26) defeated the Houston Rockets (53-26) 104-103 on Friday.The Spurs have now beaten the Rockets two straight times in a three day span. On Wednesday in San Antonio they beat the Rockets 110-98, and the change of venue didn't alter the result, as they took them down again Friday in Houston. Tim Duncan put on a show with 29 points, 10 rebounds and three assists in 34 minutes. Duncan is putting up 3.5 blocks a game in his last two against Houston, a likely candidate to oppose the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs. San Antonio has played its way up to the third seed and hope to dethrone the Memphis Grizzlies as the second best team in the west with just two games remaining. The Spurs have gone on impressive streak, which has seen them win 10 straight games dating back to Mar. 24.James Harden struggled on Friday, shooting just 5-for-19 from the field. The Spurs did a great job not letting him get to the free throw line, which is a massive part of his game. He shot just six free throw attempts, and put in four of them. The Rockets' shooting woes weren't limited to Harden though, as Josh Smith shot 12-of-26 from charity stripe. Gregg Popovich used that to his advantage and proceeded to foul Smith as often as possible. Harden and Smith weren't totally neutralized as Harden dished out 10 assists with three steals and Smith scored 20 points on 4-for-9 from the field. Houston is now 3-3 over their last six games. Their remaining games are against the New Orleans Pelicans, Charlotte Hornets and Utah Jazz.Houston will host the Pelicans, as the Spurs will welcome the Phoenix Suns to town on Sunday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (43-36) defeated the Phoenix Suns (39-41) 90-75 on Friday in New Orleans. It wasn't pretty, but the Pelicans were still able to pull out a much-needed win as the regular season winds down. Anthony Davis left the game in the second quarter after suffering a throat contusion and missed nearly half the game before returning. Despite the injury, Davis was still able to post 19 points (7-12 FG, 5-11 FT), nine rebounds and four assists in 23 minutes. Omar Asik made up for the rebounding hole Davis left when he was out of the game, as he grabbed 18 rebounds in just 22 minutes, but only managed to score 3 points. Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans each shot 6-of-14 from the field and scored 15 and 14 points respectively. Dante Cunningham had a solid outing off the bench, shooting 6-of-8 from the field en route to 12 points and nine rebounds in 31 minutes. Norris Cole (12) was the only other New Orleans player to score in double figures.The victory keeps the Pelicans' playoff hopes alive, as they are currently tied for, and hold the tiebreaker over, the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.Contrarily, the Phoenix Suns have been officially eliminated from playoff contention and don't have much to play for as the regular season comes close to its end. Eric Bledsoe has had a rough final stretch of the season, but managed 19 points (7-19 FG, 2-6 3Pt) and seven assists in 39 minutes. Markieff Morris posted a double-double of 12 points (5-12 FG) and 11 rebounds in 29 minutes, while P.J. Tucker was the third and final Sun to score in double figures, scoring 12 points in 33 minutes. Up next, the Pelicans will travel to Houston for a tough matchup with the Rockets on Sunday, while Suns head to San Antonio Sunday to take on the Spurs. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Phoenix,Suns,Smoothie King Center,39,41,43,36,5.0,19.0,37.0,84.0,11.0,19.0,56.0,29.0,11.0,7.0,25.0,30.0,84.0,8.0,10.0,43.0,17.0,10.0,Quincy Pondexter,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,27,Marcus Morris Sr.,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,14.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,28,Anthony Davis,9.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Markieff Morris,11.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Omer Asik,18.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Brandan Wright,6.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,28,Eric Gordon,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,34,P.J.

Westbrook scored and shot the ball well Friday night, posting a game-high 27 points (11-19 FG, 1-4 3Pt), 10 assists and five rebounds in 38 minutes. Enes Kanter also continued his strong offensive play, scoring 25 points (9-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and grabbing six rebounds in 32 minutes. Kanter is now averaging 21.8 points 12.2 rebounds in the month of April. Dion Waiters played one of his best games of the season, scoring 22 points (9-19 FG) in 40 minutes, while Anthony Morrow scored 19 points (7-17 FG, 5-10 3Pt) and grabbed six rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench. The win keeps Oklahoma City in the playoff hunt, but they are currently on the outside looking in. Despite holding the same record as the Pelicans for the final spot in the West, New Orleans holds the tiebreaker, so the Thunder will have to hope the Pelicans lose one of their final three games to even have a chance.The Kings are well out of the playoff race and can't stay healthy as they close out the regular season. Both DeMarcus Cousins (foot) and Rudy Gay (head) sat out for the second consecutive game, leaving Sacramento without their two best offensive players. Ben McLemore led the way for the Kings in the losing effort, scoring 20 points (8-17 FG, 4-10 3Pt) in 35 minutes. His running-mate in the backcourt, Ray McCallum, posted a solid stat line of 17 points (8-11 FG), six rebounds and four assists in 38 minutes. Filling in for Gay, Omri Casspi scored a solid 15 points (4-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-8 FT) and grabbed six rebounds in 28 minutes, while Jason Thompson, filling in for Cousins, scored just five points but managed to grab 14 rebounds in 26 minutes. Derrick Williams (17) was the only other Kings player to score in double figures Friday.Up next, the Thunder will travel to Indiana Sunday to play the Pacers, while the Kings will head to Denver and take on the Nuggets on Sunday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Sacramento,Kings,Chesapeake Energy Arena,27,52,43,36,10.0,31.0,43.0,95.0,18.0,24.0,46.0,21.0,6.0,9.0,24.0,37.0,81.0,20.0,28.0,50.0,18.0,16.0,Andre Roberson,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,16,Omri Casspi,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,28,Enes Kanter,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,32,Carl Landry,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,14,Steven Adams,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,31,Jason Thompson,14.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Dion Waiters,6.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,19.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,40,Ben McLemore,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,8.0,17.0,4.0,10.0,5.0,35,Russell Westbrook,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,11.0,19.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,38,Ray McCallum,6.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,38,Nick Collison,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Derrick Williams,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,15.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,26,Anthony Morrow,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,17.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,25,Nik Stauskas,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,16,D.J.

												The Dallas Mavericks (48-31) defeated the Denver Nuggets (29-50) 144-143 in double overtime on Friday in Denver. Dallas blew a 23-point lead Friday, but in the end, it was reserve guard Raymond Felton who took Randy Foye one-on-one on the Mavericks' final offensive possession to score the game-winning layup with 1.5 seconds left. Felton also had the game-ending defensive stop on Nuggets big man Kennth Faried. There was very little defense and a whole lot of offense in a game where Dallas had nothing to play for but pride, given that they are locked in as the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. Given that and the length of the game, most of the starters for the Mavericks were rested for both overtime periods. Despite this, Dirk Nowitzki was still able to score 25 points (10-19 FG) and grab nine rebounds in 28 minutes, while Richard Jefferson was close behind, scoring 24 points (8-15 FG, 4-8 3Pt) in 31 minutes. Devin Harris also played well off the bench, scoring 21 points (7-9 FG, 3-3 3Pt) and dishing out nine assists in 29 minutes. Both Chandler Parsons (knee) and Rajon Rondo (rest) sat out of Friday's contest.Danilo Gallinari was absolutely on fire in the losing effort for the Nuggets, scoring 47 points on a scorching 15-of-23 shooting from the field, 7-of-12 from three and 10-10 from the free throw line in 46 minutes. Gallinari's 47 points is the most scored by a Denver player since Carmelo Anthony dropped 50 in 2011. Ty Lawson also had a monster game, scoring 19 points (8-21 FG) and dishing out 18 assists in a game-high 52 minutes. Wilson Chandler also posted a double-double of 20 points and 11 rebounds. Randy Foye (17) and Kenneth Faried (14) round out all five starters who scored in double figures, while J.J. Hickson scored 14 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench.Up next, the Mavericks will travel to Los Angeles Sunday to take on the Lakers, while the Nuggets while stay home and play the Kings on Sunday. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Dallas,Mavericks,Pepsi Center,48,31,29,50,15.0,43.0,53.0,125.0,22.0,25.0,61.0,29.0,15.0,11.0,29.0,57.0,109.0,19.0,24.0,48.0,39.0,17.0,Wilson Chandler,11.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,22.0,2.0,9.0,3.0,48,Richard Jefferson,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,15.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,31,Danilo Gallinari,9.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,47.0,15.0,23.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,45,Dirk Nowitzki,9.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,25.0,10.0,19.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,37,Kenneth Faried,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,Tyson Chandler,11.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,30,Randy Foye,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,18.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,47,Monta Ellis,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,9.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,37,Ty Lawson,5.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,21.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,52,Raymond Felton,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,29,JJ Hickson,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Al-Farouq Aminu,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Will Barton,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10,Devin Harris,2.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,29,Gary Harris,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9,Charlie Villanueva,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,10.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,18,Jusuf Nurkic,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,14,Amar'e Stoudemire,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Erick Green,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,8,J.J.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (54-25) beat the Utah Jazz (36-43) 89-86 on Friday.Beno Udrih had a big game stepping in for point guard Mike Conley, who sat out with a foot injury. Udrih scored 20 points on 9-for-13 shooting from the field. Nick Calathes also chipped in 18 minutes to help fortify the backcourt without Conley. However, it was center Marc Gasol who lead the Grizzlies in assists with six. He also scored 22 points to go along with seven rebounds in a well-rounded performance. The Grizzlies are trying to fend off the San Antonio Spurs, Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Clippers, and Houston Rockets for the second seed in the Western Conference. Their three games left are against the Los Angeles Clippers, Golden State Warriors and Indiana Pacers.Rudy Gobert's defense has been impeccable this season, but his offense has really come around as of late. He's increased his scoring average in every month of the season but one. In April he's shooting 69 percent from the field for 12.5 points a game. On Friday he scored 14 points to go along with 14 boards, seven of which were on the offensive end. In April he's averaging 12.8 points, 12.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. In April, the Jazz are 3-2 with all three wins coming against teams below .500. They have three games remaining, all of which are against teams with winning records.The Jazz will head to Portland to play the Trail Blazers on Saturday, as the Grizzlies will travel to Los Angeles to take on their rival, the Clippers.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (21-58) beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-63) 106-98 on Friday.Ryan Kelly showed off his passing skills from the frontcourt against Minnesota. He finished with seven assists to go along with 21 points and four rebounds. Jordan Clarkson has been one of very few bright spots for the Lakers in what has been a dreadful season. He put up 18 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in a dominant performance against a youthful Timberwolves squad. Los Angeles only sent eight players to the court tonight so many of them put of nice statistical lines. Jabari Brown had 20 points and seven assists as well. Los Angeles ended a five-game losing streak. After the Dallas Mavericks, the Lakers will play their two final games against the Sacramento Kings.Andrew Wiggins proved again why he was the number one overall selection in last summer's draft, as well as how much his game has matured since the beginning of the season. He had a monster game against the Lakers, with 29 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. However it wasn't enough to end his team's eight game losing streak, that initially started with a 101-99 loss in overtime against the Lakers back on Mar. 25.The Golden State Warriors will host the Timberwolves on Saturday, as the Lakers will welcome the Dallas Mavericks to the Staples Center on Sunday.

												The Bulls (46-32) defeated the Heat (35-44) 89-78 at the AmericanAirlines Arena on Thursday. The Heat were firing on all cylinders in the second quarter, outscoring the Bulls 33-12. They went into halftime with a 19-point lead. But the Bulls turned the tables in the third quarter, outscoring the Heat 33-8. The Bulls entered the fourth quarter up six points and maintained a comfortable lead for the rest of the game. Pau Gasol was Chicago’s leading scorer with 16 points (8-17 FG), to go with 15 rebounds, one assist and one block in 34 minutes. In his second game back and under a minutes restriction, Derrick Rose had 12 points (5-15 FG, 0-3 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists in 20 minutes. Tony Snell filled in for Jimmy Butler (calf) and scored seven points (2-8 FG, 1-3 3Pt), to go with five rebounds and one assist in 38 minutes. Hassan Whiteside led the Heat in scoring with 19 points (9-15 FG), to go with 16 rebounds and one block in 38 minutes. Goran Dragic had 15 points (7-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt), two rebounds, one assist and one block in 33 minutes. Michael Beasley contributed 13 points (5-8 FG, 3-4  3Pt), two rebounds, one assist and one block in 19 minutes off the bench.This is a particularly painful loss for the Heat, one they probably can't afford with only three games remaining on their schedule. They’re 1.5 games behind the eighth place Nets in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls are sitting pretty at third in the East, trying to maintain home-court advantage.The Bulls have won the season series with the Heat 2-1.

												The Toronto Raptors (46-32) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33-45) 92-74 on Wednesday in Charlotte.The Raptors were dominant Monday night from start to finish, and while late in the fourth quarter it appeared as if the Hornets were looking to make one last push, Toronto had little trouble closing it out.DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto, scoring 18 points (6-16 FG, 6-7 FT), to go along with seven assists and three blocks in 31 minutes. Lou Williams provided solid scoring off the bench, putting up 16 points (5-15 FG, 3-8 3Pt) in 26 minutes. Despite their performances, the two still shot rather poorly, going a combined 11-of-31 from the field. Greivis Vasquez got the start once again with Lowry continuing to sit out with a back injury, and he matched Williams' 16 points (6-13 FG, 4-6 3Pt), while also recording five rebounds and four assists in 36 minutes. Amir Johnson missed his second consecutive game. Tyler Hansbrough got the start and logged a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds in 37 minutes. With the win, Toronto tied the Chicago Bulls for third place in the Eastern Conference, although the Raptors own the tie breaker so they currently sit above them.The Hornets struggled to get anything going Monday night. Kemba Walker was the only starter who scored in double figures with 15 points (5-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt), to go along with four rebounds and just three assists. The only other Charlotte players to score in double figures were the team's two point guards off the bench, with Mo Williams and Brian Roberts each scoring 10 points on a combined 8-of-20 shooting.As a team, Charlotte shot a dreadful 35 percent percent from the field, and the loss really hurts their playoff chances, as they are now three games behind the Celtics for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East. Up next, the Raptors will travel to Orlando on Friday and play the Magic, while the Hornets will head to Atlanta Friday to take on the East-leading Hawks.  											",Charlotte,Hornets,Toronto,Raptors,Spectrum Center,46,32,33,45,9.0,21.0,27.0,79.0,8.0,11.0,35.0,15.0,8.0,12.0,27.0,33.0,77.0,14.0,19.0,47.0,20.0,9.0,Jeffery Taylor,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,18,Terrence Ross,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,23,Marvin Williams,8.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,24,Tyler Hansbrough,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37,Bismack Biyombo,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Jonas Valanciunas,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Gerald Henderson,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,27,DeMar DeRozan,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,18.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,33,Kemba Walker,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,31,Greivis Vasquez,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,35,Mo Williams,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,20,Patrick Patterson,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,31,Noah Vonleh,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,23,Lou Williams,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,15.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,25,Brian Roberts,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,16,James Johnson,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Jason Maxiell,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Chuck Hayes,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,PJ Hairston,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,23,Bruno Caboclo,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1

												The Orlando Magic (25-53) defeated the Chicago Bulls (46-32) 105-103 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando.Down two with just over six seconds left in the game, it was Pau Gasol who was able to force his way to the free throw line and hit a pair of free throws to tie the game up. Victor Oladipo then came up clutch for the Magic, driving for a layup with just a second left in the game, therefore giving them a two point lead and eventually the victory. With the loss, the Bulls move into a tie with the Toronto Raptors for the third projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. With just four games left in the regular season, it will be a battle for future playoff positioning from here on out.The Magic were superior shooters in this one, going 46 percent from the field, while the Bulls finished at 43 percent. It was Oladipo that led the way for the Magic. Along with making the game-winning layup, Oladipo had 23 points (8-14 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 4-6 FT), five assists and three steals over 41 minutes. After shooting less than 35 percent from the field in his two previous games, Oladipo got back on track a bit Wednesday with his shot, finishing at 46 percent. Nikola Vucevic played a big factor in the win as well, posting 22 points (9-16 FG, 4-4 FT) and seven rebounds. He continues to be one of the more consistent players on this team, as he's averaging 26.3 points and 10.3 rebounds over his last three games. The third starter in double figures was Elfrid Payton, who nearly recorded a triple-double with 17 points (6-14 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT), nine rebounds and nine assists. He's been doing a little bit of everything for this team, averaging 12.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, 9.3 assists and 3.3 steals in his last four games.Jimmy Butler did his best to keep the Bulls in this game, going 6-for-10 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 19 points, while also adding six assists and two steals. He's now pushed his season averages to 20.1 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game. Pau Gasol didn't have the best day shooting the ball, but got to the free throw line a bunch to record 15 points (4-10 FG, 7-9 FT), nine rebounds and three blocked shots. Over his last three games, he's now averaging 17.7 point and 8.7 rebounds, but he'll need to do even better if the Bulls want to make a run in the playoffs. The Bulls also had some solid contributions from their bench. Taj Gibson recorded an efficient 15 points (6-12 FG, 3-5 FT) and seven rebounds, while Nikola Mirotic added 15 points (3-11 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 6-7 FT) of his own over 27 minutes.The Bulls' next game will be on the road against the Miami Heat on Thursday, while the Magic will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Friday.

												The Washington Wizards (45-33) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18-61) 119-90 on Wednesday in Philadelphia. The Wizards were without All-Star point guard John Wall (rest), but they still no issue dealing with the 76ers. Ramon Sessions was great in replacing Wall in the starting lineup, posting 19 points (5-7 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 7-9 FT), seven assists and four rebounds in 29 minutes.Bradley Beal led the team in scoring with an efficient 21 points (7-9 FG, 3-3 3Pt, 4-5 FT) in 23 minutes, while Marcin Gortat also put up a nice stat line of 19 points (8-9 FG), seven rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes. Paul Pierce was the only other starter to score in double figures with 10 points in 22 minutes, while Kevin Seraphin (12) and Will Bynum (10) each scored in double figures off the bench.Washington shot a very impressive 65.3 percent from the field and 53.3 percent from three, and the victory moves them just one game behind both the Bulls and Raptors as they look to make a late push for third place in the Eastern Conference. Robert Covington had a great shooting night and led the way for the 76ers in the losing effort, posting 27 points (8-11 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 7-8 FT) in just 24 minutes and was the only Philadelphia starter to reach double figures on the night.Jason Richardson also had an efficient performance, scoring 17 points (6-7 FG, 4-5 3Pt) in 21 minutes off the bench. Thomas Robinson scored 11 points and was the only other 76er to score in double figures, but he also added 12 rebounds to give himself a double-double on the night.The team shot a woeful 34.8 percent from the field, but the loss does help Philadelphia in their quest for the No. 1 overall pick, as they continue to boast the third worst record in the league.Up next, the Wizards will travel to Brooklyn Friday to play the Nets, while the 76ers will head to Chicago and go up against the Bulls on Saturday. 											",Philadelphia,76ers,Washington,Wizards,Wells Fargo Center,45,33,18,61,9.0,27.0,29.0,83.0,17.0,23.0,35.0,16.0,8.0,8.0,13.0,47.0,70.0,16.0,21.0,42.0,35.0,14.0,Jerami Grant,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,27,Paul Pierce,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,22,Nerlens Noel,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Drew Gooden,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Furkan Aldemir,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Marcin Gortat,7.0,6.0,0.0,4.0,18.0,8.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Robert Covington,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,27.0,8.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,24,Bradley Beal,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,23,Ish Smith,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,25,Ramon Sessions,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,29,Hollis Thompson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,16,Otto Porter Jr.,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Luc Mbah a Moute,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,23,Rasual Butler,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,22,JaKarr Sampson,0.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,22,Kris Humphries,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Thomas Robinson,12.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Will Bynum,2.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,18,Jason Richardson,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,20,Kevin Seraphin,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,21

												The Boston Celtics (36-42) defeated the Detroit Pistons (30-48) 113-103 on Wednesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.By taking the loss Wednesday, the Pistons were officially eliminated from playoff contention. The Celtics, on the other hand, picked up a much needed win, as they continue to sit as the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. They own just a one game lead over the Miami Heat, while also holding just a game and a half lead over the Indiana Pacers. With just four games left in the regular season, they Celtics will need to win the majority of their games from here on out.The Celtics saw another monster performance from Isaiah Thomas off the bench. He went 10-for-17 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 34 points while also adding six assists in 29 minutes. He's been dominant lately for the Celtics offensively, averaging 27.3 points over his last three games. Thomas received some help from Brandon Bass though, who added 16 points (5-7 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and four rebounds in 20 minutes as a starter. He's now pushed his season averages to 10.6 points and 4.8 rebounds on the year. Also coming off the bench for an impressive performance was Jae Crowder, who chipped in with 17 points 4-8 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 9-9 FT) and six rebounds. Crowder has been dealing with an ankle injury recently, but he didn't seem to have too many problems with it Wednesday. Kelly Olynyk reached double figures off the bench as well with 12 points (5-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in just 18 minutes.Despite taking the loss, it was Reggie Jackson who continued his strong play of late. He finished with a double-double, going for 21 points (10-18 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and 15 assists. It wasn't all good for the guard though, as he did record seven turnovers as well. It marked his second double-double in a row, a stretch where he's combined to go 21-for-36 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 50 points. Both Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe posted a double-double of their own. Drummond finished with 22 points (11-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 0-3 FT) and 14 rebounds, while Monroe had 19 points (9-14 FG, 1-2 FT) and 10 rebounds. This marked the fifth game out of the last six that Drummond recorded double-digit rebounds. Both Jodie Meeks and Tayshaun Prince finished in double figures off the bench. Meeks went a perfect 4-for-4 from the field and 3-for-3 from deep to score 13 points, while Prince went 7-for-8 from the field and 1-for-1 from beyond the arc to finish with 15 points.  The Celtics' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (59-19) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (35-42) 114-111 on Wednesday in Brooklyn.After a big fourth quarter from the Nets, the two teams went down to the wire, changing leads three times in the last two minutes before an Al Horford dunk and two free throws from Jeff Teague sealed the deal for Atlanta.Horford led the way for the Hawks, posting 24 points (11-20 FG, 1-1 3Pt), seven rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes of play. Teague recorded a double-double in the winning effort of 15 points (4-11 FG, 7-11 FT), 12 assists, six rebounds and four steals in 33 minutes as well. DeMarre Carroll was the other Atlanta starter to score in double figures, finishing with 19 points (7-13 FG, 3-7 3Pt), nine rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. Mike Scott was also huge for the Hawks off the bench, scoring 20 points (7-14 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and grabbing eight rebounds in 31 minutes. Paul Millsap was out once again with a shoulder injury, while Mike Muscala got the start in his place, but he had just nine points (4-6 FG) in 24 minutes. The win brings Atlanta just one game away from 60 wins on the year with just four games remaining in the regular season. They have already locked up the number one seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs.Brook Lopez, as he has grown a habit of doing, led the way for Brooklyn, scoring 26 points (8-17 FG, 10-10 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 39 minutes. Over his last two games now, Lopez has put up 58 points and 19 rebounds.Joe Johnson was not too far behind Lopez, scoring 21 points (9-15 FG, 3-9 3Pt) and grabbing eight rebounds, but he missed the potential game-tying three at the end of regulation. Deron Williams also continues to play well, posting a double-double of 10 points and 13 assists, while Thaddeus Young also recorded a double-double of 15 points and 11 rebounds. Jarrett Jack (14) and Bojan Bogdanovic (12) round out the six Nets' players who scored in double figures. The Nets were hot coming into Wednesday's matchup as winners of seven of their last eight, and while they are still winners of seven of their last nine, both those losses came at the hands of the Hawks. Regardless, the Nets still find themselves in the playoffs and hold a one-game lead over the Pacers and Heat for the final spot in the East. Up next, the Hawks will head home Friday to take on the Hornets, while the Nets will stay home Friday and play the Wizards.

												The Indiana Pacers (35-43) defeated the New York Knicks (15-63) 102-86 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Pacers picked up a very big win in this one, as they're in a fight for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. The Nets remain in that eighth spot and own just a one game lead over the Pacers, so they'll need to come out victorious in the majority of their final four games of the regular season if they want to play in the postseason. Despite turning the ball over 17 times compared to just 11 from the Knicks, the Pacers made up for it with their rebounding, as they posted a 54-34 advantage.As he's done for the majority of the time that he's been healthy, George Hill was the player that led this team to the win. He went 7-for-11 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 20 points, while also adding six rebounds and five assists. Hill was away from the team Tuesday for personal reasons, but he was able to come back for this one and pick up where he left off with another strong performance. Roy Hibbert notched a double-double in the win, finishing with 11 points (5-9 FG, 1-2 FT) and 11 rebounds over just 16 minutes. It was his first double-double over his last seven games, as the big man was able to have a bunch of success against a struggling Knicks' team. Both CJ Miles and David West finished in double figures as well in their run with the starters. West went a perfect 5-of-5 from the field to score 11 points, while Miles added 13 points (5-14 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds as well.Langston Galloway and Andrea Bargnani were the few Knicks' players to have some success Wednesday. Galloway finished with 19 points (6-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and five rebounds, while Bargnani chipped in with 15 points (5-11 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and six rebounds. Galloway has shot under 40 percent from the field in five of his last six games prior to Wednesday, so he'll likely look to try and establish more consistency in the final few games of the 2015 regular season. Bargnani has put in a couple of solid games in a row, combining for 40 points and 14 rebounds over his last two matchups. He's now averaging 14.8 points and 4.3 rebounds on the season. Tim Hardaway JR, Quincy Acy and Jason Smith all added 12 points of their own off the bench.    The Pacers' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Friday, while the Knicks will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (53-25) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (42-36) 110-74 on Wednesday in Memphis. The Grizzlies put on a clinic Wednesday night, shooting 51 percent from the field and 47 percent from three. Four of their five starters scored in double figures with Zach Randolph leading the way. Randolph scored 15 points (6-13 FG), grabbed 13 rebounds and dished out six assists in 30 minutes of play. Both Jeff Green and Marc Gasol added 15 points for Memphis, with Gasol adding eight rebounds and six assists in his effort as well. Mike Conley was the fourth Grizzlies' starter to reach double figures, putting up 10 points (4-9 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and four assists in 33 minutes. Memphis got plenty of production off the bench, with Beno Udrih scoring 14 points in 19 minutes, while Vince Carter reached 10 points in 18 minutes. In total, the Grizzlies had 47 points scored from their bench.The win brings Memphis tied with the Rockets for second place in the Western Conference playoff hunt, and it looks as though it will be between those two teams for that position. The Pelicans had a bit of an emotional hangover, as after defeating the NBA-best Golden State Warriors on Tuesday, they laid an egg against the Grizzlies. No one on New Orleans played well, with their best performance being Anthony Davis' 12 points (5-9 FG) and five rebounds in 28 minutes. Tyreke Evans (10) and Quincy Pondexter (11) were the only other players for the Pelicans who scored in double figures. Ryan Anderson epitomized the Pelicans' effort, going 0-for-6 from the field and scoring zero points in 13 minutes off the bench. As a team, they had just 13 assists to 12 turnovers and shot a poor 35 percent from the field on the night. The loss moves them back into a tie with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, but New Orleans currently holds the tiebreaker.Up next, the Grizzlies will head to Utah on Friday to take on the Jazz, while the Pelicans head home Friday and will play the Suns.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (51-27) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-62) 116-91 on Wednesday at the Moda Center in Portland.In securing the victory, the Trail Blazers moved to just two games back from the Memphis Grizzlies and Houston Rockets, who are tied for the second overall spot in the Western Conference standings. With just four games left in the regular season, they still have a shot at making their case for that second or third projected playoff seed. The Blazers were the much better shooting team in this one, going 49 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 38 percent from the floor and just 27 percent from deep.LaMarcus Aldridge had his way with the young frontcourt of the Timberwolves. He went 10-for-16 from the field to score a team-high of 24 points, while also adding 13 rebounds over 29 minutes. It marked his second straight double-double, a stretch where he's combined for 45 points and 25 rebounds. Fellow superstar Damian Lillard also played a factor in the victory. He didn't shoot the best, but he still finished with 17 points (4-13 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and six assists. He was coming off a 36-point showing on Monday, so it was somewhat of a let down performance. Like Aldridge, Robin Lopez also had success against the Timberwolves frontcourt. He went 7-for-8 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free throw line to score 18 points, while adding six rebounds as well. Coming off the bench, CJ McCollum chipped in with 13 points (6-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt) over 25 minutes.With a ton of injuries causing a depleted roster for the Timberwolves, it turned into the Andrew Wiggins show, as he finished with a game-high of 29 points (9-22 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 11-15 FT), to go along with five rebounds and four assists. It marked his fourth straight game surpassing the 20-point mark, a stretch where he's averaging 24.5 points per game.He continues to show why he was selected with the first overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. Fellow rookie Zach LaVine also continues to show his worth. LaVine posted 18 points (6-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-7 FT), six assists and two steals, while playing 38 minutes. He had posted his second career double-double on Tuesday, so this marked another nice contribution for the young guard. Kevin Martin also added 17 points (5-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and three rebounds. Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger was the final Timberwolves player to reach double figures, as he finished with 12 points and five steals.The Trail Blazers' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Thursday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (51-27) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (38-40) 104-99 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.The Cavaliers are now riding a four-game win streak and have clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Bucks, on the other hand, are currently the sixth projected playoff seed in the East. Both the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets are just two games back from them though, so they'll need to pick up some important wins over these final four games of the regular season in order to lock up that six seed. Despite suffering the loss, the Bucks were the superior shooting team, going 50 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Cavaliers finished at 49 percent from the floor and 32 percent from deep.While many teams have been giving their players some time off for rest, coach David Blatt decided to keep his star players in the lineup with a full minutes load Wednesday. Both LeBron James and Kyrie Irving had impressive showings. James finished with 21 points (8-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT), nine rebounds and eight assists, while Irving recorded 27 points (7-13 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 9-11 FT), nine assists and three steals. James has now posted 20 or more points in eight straight games, a stretch where he's averaging 23.1 points. Irving has put in two impressive performances in a row as well, combining for 54 points, 13 assists and six steals during that span. Kevin Love did his part in the victory, going 7-for-14 from the field, but just 1-for-5 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also adding 11 rebounds to notch a double-double. Tristan Thompson posted a double-double off the bench as well, finishing with 11 points (3-3 FG, 5-5 FT) and 10 rebounds.Michael Carter-Williams had one of his best offensive performances since joining the Bucks. He went 13-for-22 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 30 points, while also adding eight assists over 36 minutes. Carter-Williams has struggled with his shot lately, combining to go 7-for-22 from the field over his two previous games, so it was a step in the right direction for the guard, who recorded a new season-high in points. Zaza Pachulia had a strong day from the field as well. He finished with 19 points (8-13 FG, 3-5 FT), 10 rebounds and five steals. The five steals matched a season-high, while the double-double was his second of his last five games. Khris Middleton was hitting nearly all of his shots as well. He posted 16 points, while shooting 7-of-10 from the field and a perfect 2-of-2 from deep. The only other Buck in double figures was OJ Mayo, who came off the bench for 11 points (4-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT)The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday, while the Bucks will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Friday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (53-26) defeated the Houston Rockets (53-25) 110-98 on Wednesday in San Antonio.The Spurs are starting to look like the defending NBA champions, as they are now winners of nine straight games and 12 of their last 13. Tony Parker was questionable coming into the game with an Achilles injury, but the injury appeared to have no major effect on the point guard, as he finished with 27 points (13-18 FG) and four assists in just 26 minutes. Kawhi Leonard was not far behind, scoring 20 points (9-15 FG) and recording four steals in 35 minutes of play. Leonard has been a monster on defense as of late, logging 14 steals in his last three games. Off the bench, Manu Ginobili scored 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting, while Boris Diaw put up a solid line of 15 points (7-14 FG) and nine rebounds in 27 minutes.The victory brings the Spurs into a tie with the Clippers for fifth place in the Western Conference playoff race, although Los Angeles currently holds the tiebreaker over them with just three games left to play for each. MVP-candidate James Harden led the way for Houston, scoring 22 points (6-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt), to go along with four rebounds and four assists in 35 minutes. Coming off his 41-point performance against Oklahoma City, it was a bit of a letdown game for Harden despite still reaching the 20-point mark. Dwight Howard did not play a full load of minutes Wednesday, but still managed 16 points (7-10) and 11 rebounds in 22 minutes, as he continues to recover from a knee injury that kept him out for the majority of the season. Trevor Ariza was the only other Rockets' starter to score in double figures, finishing with 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting in 34 minutes. Off the bench, Josh Smith contributed 13 points (5-13 FG, 3-8 3Pt) and five assists in 27 minutes.With the loss and a Memphis win, Houston is now in third place in the West despite having the same record as Grizzlies, as the Rockets do not hold the tiebreaker over them.These teams will play each other once again on Saturday in Houston in another game with major playoff implications. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Los Angeles,Lakers,Pepsi Center,20,58,29,49,12.0,27.0,42.0,83.0,18.0,24.0,43.0,25.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,Wilson Chandler,8.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Wesley Johnson,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,30,Danilo Gallinari,7.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,27.0,9.0,19.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,35,Ryan Kelly,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,17.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,33,Kenneth Faried,11.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,29.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Tarik Black,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Randy Foye,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,27,Jabari Brown,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,34,Ty Lawson,3.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,39,Jordan Clarkson,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,34,JJ Hickson,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Ed Davis,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Will Barton,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,22,Dwight Buycks,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,33,Jusuf Nurkic,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Robert Sacre,9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,Erick Green,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Carlos Boozer,,,,,,,,,,,,Gary Harris,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Wayne Ellington,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Denver Nuggets (29-49) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (20-58) 119-101 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Both teams came into this game riding their own four-game losing streak, but it was the Nuggets who were able to break the steak, grabbing the 18-point victory in front of their home crowd. The Nuggets were the superior shooters in this one, going 50 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers finished at 48 percent from the floor and 31 percent from deep. Along with the shooting advantage, the Nuggets also forced the Lakers into 15 turnovers, while committing just nine of their own.The Nuggets' frontcourt were dominant in the winning effort. Kenneth Faried was moved to the starter at center, and he took advantage of the move, going off for a game-high of 29 points (10-14 FG, 9-9 FT), while also adding 11 rebounds and two blocked shots. This marked Faried's second double-double in a row, a stretch where he's combined for 39 points and 25 rebounds. Faried received a big help from Danilo Gallinari as well. Gallinari went 9-for-19 from the field and 7-for-14 from the three-point line to score 27 points, to go along with seven rebounds and two blocked shots. He's also put in two impressive games in a row, as he's combined for 47 points and 10 rebounds during that span. He's now averaging 11.4 points and 3.5 rebounds on the season. Ty Lawson Played a factor in the win as well though, as his shot looked to be dialed in. In 39 minutes, he finished with 16 points (7-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and eight assists. Lawson missed Saturday's game with a forearm injury, but it didn't look to affect him in his return to the court. Randy Foye reached double figures as well, posting 12 points (4-6 3Pt) and seven assists in 27 minutes.With injuries taking its toll on this roster, the Lakers ended up playing just eight players in the loss. Rookie Jordan Clarkson led the way with 21 points (7-18 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 7-7 FT), nine assists and two steals. While he's only averaging 11.2 points and 3.2 assists on the season, he's combined for 41 points and 15 assists over his last two outings. He's also posted 20 or more points in four of his last six games. Ryan Kelly also got hot from the field, scoring 17 points, while shooting 6-of-8 from the floor and 2-of-3 from deep. After shooting just 18 percent (3-17 FG) from the field in Tuesday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see Kelly get back on track with a solid showing. The Lakers saw some big contributions off the bench though as well. Ed Davis finished with 15 points (6-9 FG, 3-8 FT) and 12 rebounds over 31 minutes, while Dwight Buycks added 15 points (5-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and five rebounds of his own.The Nuggets' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Utah Jazz (36-42) defeated the Sacramento Kings (27-51) 103-91 on Wednesday in Salt Lake City.Derrick Favors led the way for the Jazz, recording a double-double of 18 points (9-13 FG) and 11 rebounds in just 22 minutes. The double-double is Favors' first over his last six games. Rudy Gobert also posted a double-double, putting up 12 points and 10 rebounds in 30 minutes.Rodney Hood continues to impress as of late, and Wednesday night was no different, as he scored a game-high of 20 points (7-14 FG, 3-7 3Pt) and grabbed eight rebounds in 33 minutes. Dante Exum was also able to make a solid contribution offensively, shooting 4-of-10 from the field (4-9 3Pt) en route to 12 points in 33 minutes. Gordon Hayward struggled mightily, scoring just four points in 20 minutes, but it ended up not having a significant impact on Utah's team performance. Off the bench, Trey Burke scored 11 points in 21 minutes, while Joe Ingles' 10 points rounds out the six Jazz players in double figures.The Kings were without DeMarcus Cousins (foot) and Rudy Gay (head) Wednesday, and considering those are their two best offensive players, they did not have as bad of an effort as they could have. Carl Landry and Jason Thompson got the start in place of Gay and Cousins, and both had solid performances. Landry finished with 16 points on 6-of-11 shooting in 35 minutes, while Thompson posted a double-double of 12 points (5-13 FG) and 11 rebounds in 32 minutes. Omri Casspi and Ben McLemore each scored 16 points in defeat and combined to shoot 10-of-21 from the field. Derrick Williams was the only other Kings' player to score in double figures, scoring 14 points (5-1 FG, 3-7 3Pt), grabbing five rebounds and recording three steals in 29 minutes off the bench. Both teams are well out of playoff contention, but up next, the Jazz will take on the Grizzlies at home on Saturday, while the Kings will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Saturday. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Phoenix,Suns,American Airlines Center,39,40,47,31,4.0,18.0,45.0,94.0,13.0,16.0,47.0,18.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,Richard Jefferson,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,27,Marcus Morris Sr.,10.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,33,Dirk Nowitzki,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,30,Markieff Morris,6.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,39,Tyson Chandler,23.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Brandan Wright,8.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Monta Ellis,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,10.0,21.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,34,P.J.

												The Dallas Mavericks (47-31) defeated the Phoenix Suns (39-40) 107-104 on Wednesday in Dallas.Dirk Nowitzki led the way for Dallas, scoring 19 points (7-15 FG, 1-4 3Pt), including the final four for the Mavericks to seal the deal. But, it was Tyson Chandler who had the monster performance Wednesday night, scoring 12 points (5-9 FG) and grabbing 23 rebounds in 34 minutes. It was Chandler's first time since early December where he was able to grab 20-plus rebounds. Monta Ellis scored a game-high 20 points, but it took a 10-of-21 shooting effort from the field to reach that mark. Rajon Rondo was the fourth Dallas starter to score in double figures, recording 12 points (6-9 FG) and seven assists in 30 minutes. Off the bench, Devin Harris contributed 12 points on 5-of-9 shooting, while Amar'e Stoudemire's 10 points round out the six Mavericks who scored in double figures.As a team, Dallas shot just 22 percent from three, but their offense still worked efficiently, as they had 18 assists to just eight turnovers on the night. Even with the win, the Mavericks continue to sit comfortably in seventh place in the Western Conference, and that is likely where they will be once the playoffs begin.With the loss, the Suns were eliminated from playoff contention for the fifth consecutive season. Gerald Green was phenomenal in the losing effort, scoring 30 points (10-19 FG, 5-10 3Pt, 5-5 FT) in 30 minutes, but his season-best performance was just not enough. Markieff and Marcus Morris both got the start Wednesday and combined for 31 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists, while Eric Bledsoe played poorly by his standards, posting just 14 points (5-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt), one rebound and three assists in 33 minutes. T.J. Warren has continued to be solid, as Phoenix has given him more run off the bench as of late. He had 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting in 24 minutes off the bench.Up next, the Mavericks will head to Denver to take on the Nuggets Friday, while the Suns will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Friday. 											",Portland,Trail Blazers,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Moda Center,16,62,51,27,11.0,31.0,39.0,79.0,16.0,17.0,51.0,24.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,Nicolas Batum,6.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,28,Andrew Wiggins,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,29.0,9.0,22.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,41,LaMarcus Aldridge,13.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,16.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,28,Adreian Payne,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Robin Lopez,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Justin Hamilton,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Arron Afflalo,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,29,Kevin Martin,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,33,Damian Lillard,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,4.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,28,Zach LaVine,5.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,38,Chris Kaman,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Chase Budinger,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,30,CJ McCollum,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,25,Arinze Onuaku,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Steve Blake,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,13,Lorenzo Brown,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Meyers Leonard,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,19,Robbie Hummel,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14,Allen Crabbe,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,7,Anthony Bennett,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Atlanta Hawks (58-19) throttled the Phoenix Suns (39-39), 96-69, Tuesday at the Philips Arena to set a new franchise record for wins in a season. After looking a little sluggish in late March, the Hawks have opened April with two blowout victories. The Hawks dominated the glass even without Paul Millsap, out-rebounding the Suns by 17. The Suns struggled across the board on offense with a paltry 31.% field goal percentage. All of Phoenix's starters were held to single digit points and the only Phoenix player to score in double figures was Gerald Green with 15 off the bench. Atlanta completed its first season sweep of Phoenix since the 1991-92 season. Phoenix's already dim playoff hopes may have been extinguished Tuesday with a blowout loss. The Suns' starters combined for just 38 points, low-lighted by P.J Tucker's five points on 2-of-10 shooting. On the injury front, it was reported earlier Tuesday that point guard Brandon Knight would likely miss the remainder of the season as he continues to be hampered by lingering ankle injuries. The Suns will finish off their back-to-back set Wednesday in Dallas. Atlanta looked dominant throughout Tuesday's contest, holding Phoenix to under 20 points in three quarters and just 26 points in the second half. Mike Muscala got the start for Paul Millsap, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Muscala took advantage of the added playing time by putting up 16 points, seven rebounds, and four steals and finished with a plus-28 +/- rating. Dennis Schroder returned from a two game absence, but he was capped to just 15 minutes on the floor. The Hawks will head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets on Wednesday, their second matchup in under a week. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Phoenix,Suns,State Farm Arena,39,39,58,19,4.0,24.0,39.0,77.0,10.0,14.0,48.0,20.0,15.0,3.0,17.0,24.0,74.0,12.0,16.0,32.0,15.0,14.0,DeMarre Carroll,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,8.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,23,Marcus Morris Sr.,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Al Horford,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Markieff Morris,6.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Mike Muscala,7.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Brandan Wright,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Kyle Korver,3.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,26,P.J.

												The Miami Heat (35-43) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33-44) 105-100 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.With just four games left in the season following this one, this was another huge win for the Heat, who have now moved just a half game back from the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. They had previously lost four in a row and seven of their last ten, so this was a huge sigh of relief for the Heat. Conversely, it was very tough loss for the Hornets, who also remain in reach of that final playoff spot. The loss brings them to two games back from the Celtics, so they're officially in desperation mode for their final five outings. The Heat were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field, while the Hornets finished at 43 percent. They were led by point guard Goran Dragic, who scored a team-high of 28 points (10-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 8-8 FT), to go along with five assists and two steals. His shot looks to be dialed in at the moment, as he's combined to shoot an impressive 16-for-26 from the field to score 43 points over his last two games. Luol Deng also played a big factor in the win. He posted 21 points (9-17 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six rebounds, while playing 41 minutes. After recording just three points on 1-of-8 shooting from the field in Sunday's game against the Pacers, he got back on track with this line, and the Heat will need him to continue to stay hot if they want to push themselves into the playoffs. Dwyane Wade had a strong showing as well with 19 points (6-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-10 FT) and five assists. He did have a season-high of seven turnovers though, so it wasn't all good for the guard. It was Gerald Henderson that kept the Hornets close though. Henderson went 11-for-18 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 29 points before fouling out. It was his second highest points total of the season, as he was able to shoot higher than 60 percent from the floor. Kemba Walker had decent showing as well. In 39 minutes, he finished with 17 points (7-20 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 3-5 FT), four assists and three steals. He's now combined for 41 points and six assists over his last two games, but he'll need to do even more if the Hornets want any chance at sneaking into the playoffs. Recording a double-double, Bismack Biyombo chipped in with 12 points (4-6 FG, 4-6 FT), 12 rebounds and four blocked shots. Getting the start and extended playing time with both Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller sidelined, Biyombo was able to record one of his better statistical outings of the season. Mo Williams added 15 points (5-17 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and four assists off the bench. The Heat's next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, while the Hornets will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday.  											",Miami,Heat,Charlotte,Hornets,AmericanAirlines Arena,33,44,35,43,3.0,15.0,40.0,81.0,22.0,28.0,42.0,20.0,11.0,5.0,18.0,39.0,91.0,17.0,21.0,45.0,12.0,9.0,Luol Deng,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,17.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,41,Jeffery Taylor,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Udonis Haslem,8.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Marvin Williams,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,40,Hassan Whiteside,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Bismack Biyombo,12.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,12.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,41,Dwyane Wade,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,34,Gerald Henderson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,29.0,11.0,18.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,31,Goran Dragic,4.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,34,Kemba Walker,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,20.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,38,Chris Andersen,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Jason Maxiell,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Mario Chalmers,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Mo Williams,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,27,James Ennis III,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,25,PJ Hairston,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7,Henry Walker,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Lance Stephenson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,20,Tyler Johnson,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Noah Vonleh,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2

												The New Orleans Pelicans (42-35) defeated the Golden State Warriors (63-15) 103-100 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The end of this game came down to free throws for the Pelicans, as Tyreke Evans made 1-of-2 attempts with 17 seconds left to put them up one, while Anthony Davis hit 2-of-2 with just under 10 seconds left in the game to put them up three. Stephen Curry had a shot to tie it at the buzzer, but he missed and gave the Pelicans a huge win. With the victory, the Pelicans overtook the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West. The Thunder took a tough loss to the Spurs on Tuesday as well, so the Pelicans now hold a half game lead over the Thunder with just five games left on their schedule.It was the frontcourt duo of Anthony Davis and Quincy Pondexter that pushed the Pelicans to the key victory. Davis finished with 29 points (10-21 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 9-12 FT), 10 rebounds and four blocked shots, while Pondexter had 20 points, shooting 6-for-7 from the field and 4-for-4 from the three-point line. Davis has really stepped up ever since the middle of March in order to get this team in position for a playoff berth in the loaded Western Conference. Over his last 10 games, he's averaging 24.6 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks, so it's not surprising how well he played again in this one. This marked just the second time all season that Pondexter reached the 20-point mark, so it came at the right time for the Pelicans during their intense battle with the Thunder for that final playoff spot. Tyreke Evans did a little bit of everything as well. He finished with 12 points (4-8 FG, 4-5 FT), six rebounds, nine assists and four steals, so despite scoring less than his season average, it was still a very productive showing for the guard. Draymond Green and Stephen Curry did their best to keep the Warriors in position to grab the win. Curry finished with 25 points (9-18 FG, 5-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT), six rebounds and nine assists, while Green added 24 points (10-18 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 14 rebounds. Curry missed a few big shots late in the game, but he still surpassed the 20-point mark for the ninth time over his last 10 outings. Green was really struggling of late, combining to go just 4-for-18 from the field and 1-for-6 from the three-point line in his two previous games, so it was a step in the right direction for him, pushing his season averages to 11.6 points and eight rebounds on the season. The surprise of the night was Klay Thompson, who just couldn't get his shot to fall. He went just 2-for-10 from the field and 1-for-5 from deep to score seven points, marking his second poor performance in a row. He shot just 3-of-11 from the field in Sunday's game against the Spurs, so he needs to get locked back in before the playoffs start next week.The Pelicans' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday, while the Warriors will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Golden State,Warriors,Smoothie King Center,63,15,42,35,9.0,19.0,36.0,83.0,22.0,30.0,45.0,25.0,12.0,9.0,22.0,42.0,95.0,7.0,10.0,50.0,25.0,11.0,Quincy Pondexter,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,34,Harrison Barnes,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Anthony Davis,10.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,29.0,10.0,21.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,40,Draymond Green,14.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,10.0,18.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,34,Omer Asik,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Andrew Bogut,8.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Eric Gordon,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,33,Klay Thompson,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,30,Tyreke Evans,6.0,9.0,4.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,27,Stephen Curry,6.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,18.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,34,Norris Cole,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21,Marreese Speights,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Ryan Anderson,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,15.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,30,Andre Iguodala,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,28,Toney Douglas,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11,Shaun Livingston,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Dante Cunningham,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Alexis Ajinca,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,David Lee,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10

												The San Antonio Spurs (52-26) continued their torrid stretch Tuesday with a 113-88 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder (42-36) at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. This game was nearly over before fans could settle into their seats as the Spurs jumped out to a 29-10 lead after one quarter. The rout was on from there as the Thunder failed to get into a rhythm on offense and simply couldn't get stops to cut into the lead. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook was held in check, finishing with 17 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 26 minutes before being rested for the fourth quarter. San Antonio has now won eight games in a row and are putting pressure on the teams ahead of it in the Western Conference playoff standings. San Antonio has beaten the likes of Golden State, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City (twice) during its current win streak. Kawhi Leonard led the charge for the Spurs, scoring 26 points in 24 minutes on the floor. The lone blemish for the Spurs in Tuesday's game was Tony Parker, who missed of the second half with tightness in his Achilles. The Spurs could have just been exercising caution with their veteran guard as they held a 26-point lead at halftime and have another Game Wednesday against Houston. Oklahoma City once seemed to be a near lock for the eighth seed in the West, but a four-game slide has sent the Thunder tumbling out of the playoff standings. The Pelicans got the win Tuesday and are now in the driver's seat for the last playoff spot. Oklahoma City is at a disadvantage down the stretch because New Orleans holds the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Thunder. On the injury front, Andre Roberson returned to action after missing two and a half weeks with an ankle injury. He finished with five points and two steals in 18 minutes of action. The Thunder will look to snap their losing streak Friday when they host the Kings. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,San Antonio,Spurs,Chesapeake Energy Arena,52,26,42,36,5.0,16.0,29.0,74.0,12.0,24.0,35.0,13.0,15.0,10.0,22.0,43.0,83.0,6.0,9.0,36.0,26.0,15.0,Kyle Singler,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,14,Tim Duncan,9.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,23,Enes Kanter,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Kawhi Leonard,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,26.0,10.0,15.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,24,Steven Adams,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Aron Baynes,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Dion Waiters,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,27,Danny Green,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,17,Russell Westbrook,2.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,26,Tony Parker,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Anthony Morrow,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,24,Boris Diaw,4.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,Mitch McGary,9.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Manu Ginobili,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,17,Andre Roberson,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,18,Cory Joseph,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14,D.J.

												The Sacramento Kings (27-50) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-61) 116-111 on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention, this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals. The Kings came out as the superior shooters in this one, going 53 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 48 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep. Also helping push the Kings to a win was their rebounding, as they finished with a 49-36 advantage. With DeMarcus Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury, it was Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi who really stepped up and had huge games. Gay finished with 33 points (9-17 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 13-15 FT), seven rebounds and five assists, while Casspi posted 31 points (12-20 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and five rebounds. Casspi had far-and-away his best performance of the season, as he's really picked it up lately. Over his last four games, he's averaging 20.0 points, while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field. Gay, on the other hand, is on fire as well, combining to go 19-of-35 from the field and 4-for-6 from deep for 57 points over his last two outings. He's now pushed his season averages to 20.9 points and 5.9 rebounds per game on the season. Coming off the bench, Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well. He went 8-for-12 from the field to score 18 points, while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well. The 18 points matched a season-high for the forward, as it was one of his better outings of the year. Despite being unable to limit the Kings' offense, the Timberwolves nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own. Kevin Martin had the most impressive line, finishing with 37 points (13-31 FG, 3-11 3Pt, 8-11 FT) and eight assists. It was a season-high in field goal attempts for the guard, who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday, where he went just 3-of-12 from the field. He's now averaging 19.9 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the Timberwolves are dealing with. Rookie Andrew Wiggins had a big game as well though, recording 26 points (11-20 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and eight rebounds. He's posted 20 points or more in seven of his last eight games, as he's done his best to help Martin pick up the slack of those sitting out. Zach LaVine was the other big contributor. In 40 minutes, he finished with 21 points (9-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and 11 assists, marking just the second double-double of his career.   The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Portland to take on the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (53-26) held off the Los Angeles Lakers (20-57), 105-100, on Tuesday at the Staples Center.Tuesday's game was the second half of the Clippers and Lakers ""home-and-home"" set that started Sunday. The Clippers routed the Lakers 106-78 in that game, but Tuesday's game proved to be far more competitive. The Lakers hung close throughout Tuesday's contest thanks to rookie Jordan Clarkson's 20 point, six assist outing, but the Clippers' timely shooting helped seal their seventh straight victory over their cross-town rival. The Lakers have now dropped four straight and seven of their last nine overall. Jordan Clarkson shared ball handling duties with Jeremy Lin, who produced 14 points and five assists over 24 minutes on the floor. The Lakers will play the second half of a back-to-back set Wednesday when they travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets. The Clippers could ill-afford to drop a winnable game Tuesday after the Spurs tied their record with a blowout win over the Thunder. Despite some occasional sloppy play that allowed the Lakers to stay close, the Clippers took care of business to notch their 53rd win on the season. Jamal Crawford returned to the floor Tuesday after missing over a month with a calf injury. Crawford showed a some rust, finishing with just four points on 2-of-7 shooting in 19 minutes, but should be able to round back into form for the postseason. Chris Paul recorded 10 assists in the game, marking 25 total assists since his last turnover. The Clippers are off until Saturday when they host the Grizzlies in a matchup with potentially major playoff implications.

												In a battle of brothers, the Brooklyn Nets (36-41) won their ninth game in 11 chances when they defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (50-27), 106-96. This game was originally slated for January 26th but was postponed due to Winter Storm Juno. LaMarcus Aldridge, Nicolas Batum, and Chris Kaman didn’t make the cross-country trip for the Blazers.The Nets’ win gives them a full game lead over the eight seed Boston Celtics while moving them two games behind the six seed Milwaukee Bucks with five games remaining. Four players accounted for 91 of the team’s 106 points (86 percent). None of the Nets starters committed a turnover, and Joe Johnson made a basket for the 879th straight game, longest active streak in the league. Deron Williams continued his improved play post-All-Star break, finishing with 24 points, 10 assists, six rebounds and four three-pointers in 37 minutes. Brook Lopez, recent Player of the Week award winner, contributed 32 points, reaching 30 points for the sixth time in 11 games. Thaddeus Young rounded out the solid performances with 20 points and a thunderous dunk over Meyers Leonard.The Blazers can drop no further than the four seed as a division winner, regardless of record, but home court advantage is quickly fading as they fell one and half games behind the five seed Los Angeles Clippers. C.J. McCollum and Meyers Leonard started in place of Batum and Aldridge, and they combined for 32 points and 21 rebounds with the increased responsibility. Damian Lillard supplied more than a third of the offense, scoring 36 points and hitting six three-pointers in 39 minutes. The Blazers were awarded a three-pointer on a Damian Lillard 19-foot jumper during the third quarter. Since the referees failed to review the play in a timely manner, the extra point stood.

												The Rockets (53-24) took down the Thunder (42-35) 115-112 at the Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday. The game was a showdown between two of the most prolific scorers in the league. Houston’s James Harden put up 41 points (12-22 FG, 6-9 3Pt, 11-13 FT), to go with six rebounds, six assists and three steals in 38 minutes. Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook had yet another tripe-double, with 40 points (12-29 FG, 4-11 3 Pt, 12-15 FT), 11 rebounds and 13 assists in 41 minutes. The Rockets were in control for most of the game, but, late in the fourth quarter, the Thunder staged a comeback. They tied the game 100-100 on a Westbrook three-pointer with 3:12 on the clock. Harden responded by scoring the Rockets’ next eight points, bringing the score to 108-101. Westbrook continued to hit shots from beyond the arc to keep his team in the game, but was unable to sink a three that would’ve tied the game as time expired. Harden’s supporting cast included Dwight Howard, who had 22 points (10-15 FG), eight rebounds and two steals in 23 minutes. Josh Smith had 14 points (7-17 FG, 0-3 3Pt), four rebounds, four assists and two steals in 27 minutes. Oklahoma City’s Enes Kanter had 21 points (9-19 FG), 17 rebounds and one block in 38 minutes. Kanter is averaging 27.0 points and 16.5 rebounds in 36 minutes over his last three games. Anthony Morrow came off the bench and scored 22 points (8-15 FG, 6-8 3Pt), four rebounds, two assists and one steal in 36 minutes. The Rockets are second in the Western Conference, 10.5 games behind the Warriors. The Thunder are currently eighth in the West, only a half-game ahead of the ninth place Pelicans. The Rockets have swept the Thunder in their season series 3-0. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Houston,Rockets,Chesapeake Energy Arena,53,24,42,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kyle Singler,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,30,Trevor Ariza,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,30,Enes Kanter,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,37,Terrence Jones,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,24,Steven Adams,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,14,Dwight Howard,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,10.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Dion Waiters,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,39,James Harden,6.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,41.0,12.0,22.0,6.0,9.0,3.0,38,Russell Westbrook,11.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,40.0,12.0,29.0,4.0,11.0,4.0,40,Jason Terry,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,24,Anthony Morrow,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,36,Josh Smith,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,17.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,26,D.J.

												The Indiana Pacers (34-43) defeated the Miami Heat (34-43) 112-89 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.With both teams just barely on the outside looking in for the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race and less than 10 games left in the regular season, this marked another extremely important outing. The Pacers were able to come out victorious though, pulling even with the Heat in the standings and pushing themselves within striking distance at just one game back from the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed. In order to seal the win, the Pacers used a superior rebounding performance, out-rebounding the Heat 55-37.After missing eight months with a broken leg, Paul George made his highly anticipated return to the court Sunday, playing in a limited 15 minutes of action. He was still quite productive despite the minutes restriction, going 5-for-12 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 13 points. With the playoffs potentially in the future, it was a good sign for the Pacers, as they will need the former all-star's playmaing abilities during this final stretch of the season. Along with George, Luis Scola also put in a strong performance off the bench. In just 18 minutes, he was able to finish with a double-double, recording a team-high of 23 points (10-15 FG, 3-3 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds. After shooting less than 30 percent from the floor in each of his last two games, he was able to get dialed back in Sunday and help the Pacers come out on top. Solomon Hill led the starters offensively, posting 19 points (6-10 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and six rebounds. C.J. Miles chipped in with 17 points (6-13 FG, 5-10 3Pt) and two assists as well.While the Heat struggled to keep up with the Pacers in this one, Dwyane Wade still played well and continued his stellar season, recording a game-high of 27 points (11-21 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 5-7 FT), while also adding three assists. He's combined to shoot 22-of-39 from the field over his last two games while scoring 61 points, as his shot looks to be locked in. On the season, he's pushed his averages to 21.6 points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. Goran Dragic also had some success against this Pacer's team during the loss. He went 6-for-10 from the field and 1-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 15 points, to go along with five assists. The Heat's backcourt is going to be heavily relied upon to help get this team into the playoffs, so both Wade and Dragic will need to step their game up even further in the near future. Coming off the bench, James Ennis added 17 points (6-11 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds in 28 minutes.     The Pacers' next game will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Wednesday, while the Heat will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (51-26) defeated the Golden State Warriors (63-14) 107-92 on Sunday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.Pushing their win streak to seven games in a row, the Spurs had another strong performance Sunday, ending the Warriors' own streak of 12 straight wins in the process. While the Spurs have already clinched a spot in the playoffs, they're still fighting for a higher seed, as the win tied them with the Clippers for the fifth projected playoff seed in the West, while they sit only two games back from the Houston Rockets, who are all the way up in second place near the top of the standings. The Warriors, on the other hand, continue to have a commanding lead in the standings, as they've already clinched the number one overall seed in the Western Conference playoffs.The Spurs were the superior shooters in this game, going 53 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Warriors finished at just 43 percent from the floor and 32 percent from deep. Kawhi Leonard led the way, finishing with a game-high of 26 points (11-17 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT), while adding five reounds in just 24 minutes as well. He made his presence felt on the defensive side of the ball, notching a season-high of seven steals in the win. He's shot the ball very well recently, finishing over 60 percent from the field in four of his last five games, which bodes well for the Spurs as the playoffs near. Leonard had some help Sunday though, with Tim Duncan posting 19 points (6-7 FG, 7-8 FT) and seven rebounds over 24 minutes. While he'll likely be limited in his playing time over the next few weeks in order to keep him as fresh as possible for the post season, it was still another nice showing for the forward, who's averaged 13.6 points and 9.1 rebounds this year. Danny Green chipped in with 18 points (7-10 FG, 4-6 3Pt), six rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He was hitting nearly everything in this game, as the Warriors just didn't have an answer for him defensively.Stephen Curry did his best to keep the Warriors in this game, going 9-for-17 from the field and 5-for-10 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 24 points, to go along with four rebounds and six assists. After struggling with his shot during Saturday's game against the Mavericks, Curry got back on track Sunday and hit at least five three-point shots, something he's done in six out of his last eight games. He's now averaging 23.6 points and 7.7 assists on the season. With Klay Thompson struggling to just six points (3-11 FG, 0-3 3Pt), the only other starter to reach double figures in points was Andrew Bogut, who recorded 10 points (5-7 FG) and seven rebounds in just 18 minutes. It was only the second game over his last 13 outings recording 10 or more points. Coming off the bench, Leandro Barbosa finished with 12 points (6-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and four assists, while Andre Iguodala added 10 points (4-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and two rebounds.The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, while the Warriors will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Tuesday. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Golden State,Warriors,AT&T Center,63,14,51,26,6.0,16.0,41.0,74.0,12.0,15.0,44.0,25.0,11.0,9.0,28.0,38.0,86.0,5.0,10.0,35.0,24.0,10.0,Kawhi Leonard,5.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,26.0,11.0,17.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,24,Harrison Barnes,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,28,Tim Duncan,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Draymond Green,7.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,26,Matt Bonner,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,24,Andrew Bogut,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Danny Green,6.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,18.0,7.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,28,Klay Thompson,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,24,Tony Parker,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,23,Stephen Curry,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,17.0,5.0,10.0,4.0,30,Patty Mills,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Andre Iguodala,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,24,Manu Ginobili,4.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,22,Festus Ezeli,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Boris Diaw,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Leandro Barbosa,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Aron Baynes,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,David Lee,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Cory Joseph,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Justin Holiday,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,17

												The New York Knicks (15-62) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18-60) 101-91 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York.In a matchup of Eastern Conference bottom feeders, the Knicks came out with the hard fought victory, despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention. They were the superior shooters in this one, going 52 percent from the field, while the Sixers ended at just 38 percent. While they committed 19 turnovers to just 10 from the Sixers, the Knicks made up for it in the rebounding department, holding a 48-36 advantage by game's end.Andrea Bargnani was the biggest reason for the Knicks' success, as he finished with a game-high of 25 points, shooting 8-for-15 from the floor and 2-for-3 from the three-point line. He also chipped in with eight rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots, doing a little bit of everything in the win. After making just 1-of-9 attempts from the floor in Friday's game against the Wizards, it was a step back in the right direction for one of the Knicks' biggest offensive threats. Shane Larkin was another huge factor in the win, nearly recording a triple-double. He finished with 15 points (4-8 FG, 7-8 FT), 11 rebounds and seven assists, while playing 41 minutes. The rebounds were a season-high for the guard, who hasn't surpassed six yet this season. Lance Thomas and Tim Hardaway Jr were the other two Knick players to reach double figures. Thomas recorded 14 points (6-8 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and nine rebounds, while Hardaway Jr added 12 points (5-11 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and four assists.The Sixers received most their most production from Ish Smith, who finished with 17 points (8-18 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and seven assists. Despite averaging just six points on the season, he's really picked up his offensive output lately, averaging 18.3 points over his last three games. Hollis Thompson came off the bench for 17 points (6-11 FG, 5-6 3Pt) of his own over 26 minutes. Like Smith, Thompson has had a really nice start to April and is averaging 15.7 points over his last three outings. While he had to leave Saturday's game after suffering a cut to his eye, Nerlens Noel was back in the lineup and didn't look to have any lingering issues, finishing with 14 points (7-14 FG, 0-1 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now pushed his season averages to 9.9 points and 8.1 rebounds on the season.  The Knicks' next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.

												The Utah Jazz (35-42) defeated the Sacramento Kings (26-50) 101-95 on Sunday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.While both teams have already been eliminated from playoff contention, it was still another hard fought game Sunday. Both teams shot very similar percentages, with the Jazz going 46 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 48 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep. This marked the fifth straight loss for the Kings, as they look to improve their draft positioning for the 2015 NBA Draft.The Jazz got their biggest offensive contribution from Rodney Hood, who led this team to the close victory. The rookie finished with a team-high of 25 points (9-17 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 6-7 FT), to go along with four steals. He's only averaging 7.6 points on the season, but he's put together two impressive performances in a row, combining for 42 points and five steals. His four steals were also a career-high. While Gordon Hayward struggled to just five points (2-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt), it was Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors who gave Hood the most help. Gobert finished with 10 points (5-7 FG), nine rebounds and two blocked shots, while Favors added 11 points (5-11 FG, 1-1 FT) and five rebounds of his own. Favors could have put up some higher numbers, but he was limited to just 16 minutes, as he was given a light work load due to the season wearing down and nothing much left to play for. Favors has averaged 16.4 points and 8.2 rebounds so far this season, both of which are the best numbers of his five-year career.With Rudy Gay sitting out another game due to suffering a concussion earlier last week, it was Ben McLemore who gave DeMarcus Cousins the most help on the offensive side of the ball. McLemore shot 8-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also contributing five rebounds and four steals. McLemore has struggled with his consistency over the course of this season, so the Kings' coaching staff would love to see McLemore show some added improvement as the second-year guard's season comes near to its end. The four steals also matched a season-high for him. Cousins, on the other hand, posted a game-high of 26 points (11-22 FG, 4-9 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists. It marked his sixth double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaging an impressive 28.3 points and 16.8 rebounds. The only other King in double figures was Omri Casspi, who chipped in with 14 points (5-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five rebounds.The Kings' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday, while the Jazz will head home to play the Kings again on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (52-26) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (20-56) 106-78 on Sunday at the Staples Center.The Clippers came out with a very strong first half Sunday, grabbing a 49-36 lead by the half. Along with the quick start, the Clippers also used their superior shooting to help coast to the win. They went 53 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers finished at 39 percent from the floor and 41 percent from deep. With the win, the Clippers remain a half game ahead of the streaking San Antonio Spurs for the fifth projected playoff seed in the West, while the Portland Trail Blazers still own a game lead over the Clippers for the fourth spot.The Clippers' frontcourt was a huge factor in the win. Blake Griffin led the way, going 8-for-14 from the floor to post a team-high of 18 points. He's now pushed his season averages to 22.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. DeAndre Jordan also played well, notching a double-double for the third time in as many games. He finished with 16 points (7-9 FG, 2-8 FT), 11 rebounds and four steals over 30 minutes. During his last three games, he's averaging 14.3 points and 15.3 rebounds. The four steals marked a new season-high for the center as well. While he didn't do much as a scorer, finishing with just seven points (3-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt) in 30 minutes, Chris Paul made up for it with his distributions to his teammates, as he added 15 assists in the victory as well. He's averaging 13.7 assists over his last three games. Both Matt Barnes (4-8 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and J.J. Redick (4-6 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) were in double figures as well with 14 and 12 points respectively.The Lakers really struggled to find any production offensively Sunday. Wesley Johnson was one of the few bright spots, posting 16 points (6-16 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds over 32 minutes. While he had some decent production, he still continues to struggle with his shot, as he's shot less than 40 percent from the field in five of his last six games. He's averaging 9.8 points and 4.2 rebounds on the season. Tarik Black and Jabari Brown were the only other two Lakers in double figures. Black finished with 10 points (4-5 FG, 2-4 FT) and nine rebounds, while Brown added 10 points (4-9 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and an assist. Since being called up from the NBA D-League in early March, Brown has done everything he can to make his case for his future in the league. Over 13 games, he's averaging 9.3 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists, while playing just below 26 minutes per game.These two teams will play each other again on Tuesday in the second of back-to-back outings.

												The Charlotte Hornets (33-43) kept their playoff hopes alive as they narrowly edged out the Philadelphia 76ers (18-59), 92-91. Ish Smith missed two free throws with 10 seconds remaining, opening the door for Gerald Henderson’s game-winning layup moments later. Smith followed up with an awry layup attempt at the buzzer that was altered by Bismack Biyombo.The Hornets tied the Indiana Pacers for the 10th best record in the East, just one and a half games out of the playoff picture before the day began. Al Jefferson was ruled out prior to the game after leaving Friday’s game with right knee soreness. Kemba Walker scored a game-high 24 points, picking up where he left off when Jefferson missed time earlier this season. Mo Williams chipped in 18 points off the bench, and Jefferson’s replacement, Bismack Biyombo, blocked three shots in 32 minutes. One night after scoring all 10 of his points in the fourth quarter, Lance Stephenson played a team-low seven minutes and was held scoreless. He’s currently 16-of-100 on three-pointers for the season, the worst mark in NBA of anyone attempting at least 100 threes.Already without the injured Isaiah Canaan, Thomas Robinson and Jason Richardson, the Sixers endured a blow when Nerlens Noel suffered a right lower eyelid laceration. He didn’t return, finished the game with one block and one steal in 11 minutes. The Sixers more than doubled their yearly block number, swatting 14 shots as a team. Jerami Grant accounted for six of the team’s blocks, adding 10 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two three-pointers in the loss. Robert Covington, who replaced JaKarr Sampson in the starting lineup, scored 15 points and hit three three-pointers. The Sixers were unable to capitalize at the charity stripe, converting 24-of-33 free throws. The Hornets begin a span of five games in seven nights Tuesday when they face the Miami Heat. The Sixers conclude a three-game road trip Saturday against the New York Knicks. 											",Charlotte,Hornets,Philadelphia,76ers,Spectrum Center,18,59,33,43,1.0,13.0,35.0,86.0,21.0,23.0,44.0,13.0,11.0,11.0,26.0,28.0,76.0,24.0,33.0,40.0,13.0,15.0,Jeffery Taylor,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Jerami Grant,4.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,28,Marvin Williams,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,33,Nerlens Noel,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10,Bismack Biyombo,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Furkan Aldemir,6.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Gerald Henderson,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,29,Robert Covington,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,29,Kemba Walker,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,11.0,21.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,34,Ish Smith,9.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,20.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,33,Mo Williams,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,5.0,17.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,30,Glenn Robinson III,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,19,PJ Hairston,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,16,Henry Sims,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Noah Vonleh,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Luc Mbah a Moute,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,31,Lance Stephenson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6,Hollis Thompson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,23,Jason Maxiell,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,JaKarr Sampson,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17

												The Atlanta Hawks (57-19) throttled the Brooklyn Nets (35-41) by a score of 131-99 to tie the franchise record for wins Saturday at the Philips Arena. Atlanta came into Saturday's game on three days rest and it showed early on against a Brooklyn team that ground out a 114-109 victory over Toronto on Friday. The Hawks got off to a torrid start, shooting 64 percent in the first half on their way to putting up 66 points through the first 24 minutes. Brooklyn had a difficult time solving Atlanta's defense, which led to 21 turnovers on the night. The Nets will look to avenge this loss Wednesday when these teams match up again in Brooklyn. Brooklyn had vaulted into seventh place in the East with six straight wins coming into Saturday, but sloppy play against the conference's top team was a recipe for disaster. Brook Lopez cooled off from his recent offensive tear, scoring just 11 points and pulling down six rebounds after a 30 point, 17 rebound performance Friday. One positive that can be taken away is that Brooklyn was able to rest its starters for the fourth quarter, giving them some added down time ahead of Monday's game against Portland.Atlanta hadn't been playing its best basketball of late, but looked every bit like the best team in the East on Saturday with a dominant performance. Al Horford was the catalyst on offense with 20 points on 10-of-13 shooting in just 21 minutes of action. It was an all-around team effort with 40 assists on 49 made baskets. Eight Hawks connected from three point range, totalling 17 made threes for the game. The lone blemish for the Hawks in this game was Paul Millsap, who suffered a shoulder injury and did not return. The Hawks will look to set a new franchise record for wins Tuesday when they host the Suns. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Brooklyn,Nets,State Farm Arena,35,41,57,19,16.0,27.0,46.0,72.0,16.0,19.0,29.0,37.0,8.0,10.0,22.0,38.0,75.0,9.0,15.0,36.0,20.0,19.0,DeMarre Carroll,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,26,Joe Johnson,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,20,Paul Millsap,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Thaddeus Young,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,21,Al Horford,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,20.0,10.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21,Brook Lopez,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Kyle Korver,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,22,Markel Brown,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,28,Jeff Teague,3.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,23,Deron Williams,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,25,Pero Antic,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,14,Bojan Bogdanovic,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,32,Kent Bazemore,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,19,Jarrett Jack,1.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,19,Shelvin Mack,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Mason Plumlee,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Thabo Sefolosha,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,22,Earl Clark,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,21,Mike Muscala,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19,Cory Jefferson,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,14

												The Detroit Pistons (30-47) dealt a crushing blow to the Miami Heat's (34-42) playoff chances Saturday with a 99-98 victory at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Miami had a golden opportunity to tie Brooklyn in the standings after the Nets were routed in Atlanta earlier Saturday, but let this game slip away for a gut-wrenching loss. The Heat appeared to be on their way to a victory with a seemingly comfortable 12 point lead with 4:13 to go, but the Pistons battled back with a 14-3 run. Dwayne Wade, who had been efficient from the floor through three quarters, missed all four of his field goal attempts in  the fourth quarter. Wade's miss with 10 seconds to go led to Reggie Jackson's go ahead layup with five ticks left on the clock. The Heat's playoff hopes now hang in the balance with several teams within one game of overtaking them. Miami appeared to be a lock for the playoffs two weeks ago, but a 2-6 record over its last eight games has put its post season hopes in serious jeopardy. Dwayne Wade was able to play 35 minutes on a banged up knee, which he aggravated Thursday in Cleveland. He finished with 24 points, but couldn't convert down the stretch. The Heat are in direct competition with the Pacers and Hornets for one of the final two spots in the East, which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how they perform against them in their next two games. Miami draws a matchup in Indiana on Sunday before hosting Charlotte on Tuesday. Detroit gave Miami a scare late in their last meeting, but it was able to complete the comeback Saturday with a big win. Reggie Jackson was sensational with 29 points and 11 assists, but did commit seven turnovers. Andre Drummond had 11 points and 17 rebounds. The Pistons are off until Wednesday when they host the Celtics. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Miami,Heat,Little Caesars Arena,34,42,30,47,12.0,26.0,36.0,73.0,15.0,23.0,33.0,20.0,16.0,5.0,20.0,37.0,77.0,19.0,26.0,37.0,19.0,14.0,Caron Butler,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,27,Luol Deng,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,38,Anthony Tolliver,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,35,Udonis Haslem,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13,Andre Drummond,17.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Hassan Whiteside,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,31,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,16.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,41,Dwyane Wade,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,11.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,34,Reggie Jackson,3.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,29.0,11.0,18.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,37,Goran Dragic,2.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,35,John Lucas III,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,13,Mario Chalmers,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,24,Tayshaun Prince,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Henry Walker,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,21,Jodie Meeks,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8,Chris Andersen,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10,Joel Anthony,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Tyler Johnson,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,12,Shawne Williams,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3,James Ennis III,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18

												The Boston Celtics (35-42) defeated the Toronto Raptors (45-32) in a 117-116 overtime thriller Saturday at the Air Canada Centre.Boston had a six point lead with under two minutes to go in the fourth, but DeMar DeRozan had eight points in the final 1:23 to send this game into overtime. The Celtics and Raptors traded baskets in the extra period, with three lead changes in the final 32 seconds. Toronto's Louis Williams canned the go-ahead three with four seconds to go, but Marcus Smart answered with a buzzer beater to give the Celtics the win. Boston will look to tie the season series at two games apiece when they meet again April 14. Boston gained ground on Miami and Brooklyn on Saturday after the Heat and Nets both lost. The Celtics moved ahead of the Heat for the eighth and final spot in the East with Saturday's thrilling victory. Isaiah Thomas was a difference maker again off the bench, scoring a team-high 25 points. The Celtics have five games remaining, with three of those games coming against playoff bound teams. Boston will be off until Wednesday when they take on Detroit. Toronto dropped both games of a back-to-back set after Saturday's loss at home. The Raptors lost those two games by six points combined. DeMar DeRozan was prolific in his 43 minutes on the floor, pouring in 38 points. Louis Williams was a big contributor off the bench with 27 points. Kyle Lowry was sidelined again with a back issue that has lingered since late March. The Raptors will be off until Wednesday as well when they travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Boston,Celtics,Scotiabank Arena,35,42,45,32,,,,,,,,,,8.0,26.0,47.0,97.0,15.0,22.0,44.0,26.0,15.0,Terrence Ross,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,29,Evan Turner,6.0,10.0,3.0,0.0,18.0,9.0,17.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,41,Tyler Hansbrough,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Brandon Bass,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Jonas Valanciunas,14.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Tyler Zeller,9.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,DeMar DeRozan,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,38.0,14.0,25.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,43,Avery Bradley,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,37,Greivis Vasquez,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,37,Marcus Smart,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,31,Lou Williams,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,27.0,9.0,17.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,34,Isaiah Thomas,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,10.0,19.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,26,Patrick Patterson,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,31,Jae Crowder,4.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,30,James Johnson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Kelly Olynyk,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,24,Chuck Hayes,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Jonas Jerebko,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Bruno Caboclo,,,,,,,,,,,,Jared Sullinger,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,12

												The Washington Wizards (44-33) beat the Memphis Grizzlies (52-25), 92-83. It was their first win in Memphis since November 3rd, 2004. Jeff Green exited due to back spasms, contributing nine points and one emphatic dunk on Kevin Seraphin in 29 minutes.The Wizards won their third straight game to move two and half games behind the three seed Chicago Bulls. They were without Paul Pierce and Nene Hilario for the second straight game, both resting in preparation for the playoffs. Even though Bradley Beal missed all six three-point tries, he still scored a game-high 20 points on 21 shots in 40 minutes. Marcin Gortat entered the game averaging a double-double since the All-Star break but was held to six points and eight rebounds against the Grizzlies’ frontline. John Wall followed up Friday’s career-high 18-assist performance with 14 assists. He’s second to Los Angeles Clippers’ Chris Paul with 10.0 assists per game.The Grizzlies moved out of a tie with the Houston Rockets but still claim the three seed. The San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers are two and half games back, a number that could change with the Clippers in action Saturday, with five games remaining. Zach Randolph played through lower back tightness and finished with six points and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. The team shot 1-of-15 on three-pointers and fell to 29-10 at home this season. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley were the only Grizzlies to reach double figure scoring, producing 18 and 14 respectively. Conley hasn't hit a three-pointer in his last two games, going 0-of-10 as he battles a sore left wrist. The Wizards have three days off before battling the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday. The Grizzlies also have three days off, concluding a four-game homestand against the New Orleans Pelicans. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Washington,Wizards,FedExForum,44,33,52,25,1.0,13.0,31.0,73.0,13.0,17.0,40.0,22.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,Jeff Green,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,29,Otto Porter Jr.,6.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,28,Zach Randolph,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,31,Drew Gooden,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,30,Marc Gasol,11.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,36,Marcin Gortat,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,31,Courtney Lee,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,34,Bradley Beal,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,10.0,21.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,39,Mike Conley,0.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,15.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,32,John Wall,6.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,36,Kosta Koufos,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11,Rasual Butler,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,19,Nick Calathes,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Ramon Sessions,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,19,Vince Carter,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,19,Kris Humphries,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,Beno Udrih,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,17,Kevin Seraphin,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,JaMychal Green,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,DeJuan Blair,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Golden State Warriors (63-13) continued their march to the playoffs with another convincing win Saturday, defeating the Dallas Mavericks (46-31), 123-110,  at the American Airlines Center. Despite a quiet night from Steph Curry, the Warriors were able to cruise to their 12th straight victory. Curry finished with just 11 points on 4-of-12 shooting, but Marreese Speights and Andre Iguodala scored 18 apiece off the bench to help offset Curry's outing. Dallas couldn't overcome a big fourth quarter deficit and never got closer than 12 points. With the win, Golden State completed the season sweep over Dallas. Golden State has lost just one game since early March, when it fell 114-103 to Denver on the 13th. The Warriors have been finding different ways to win, ranging from comebacks to nights where their stars aren't performing at their best. Draymond Green returned to action Saturday after being sidelined earlier in the week with a shin injury. Green finished with five points and six rebounds over 30 minutes on the floor. The Warriors have another big test on the horizon with a matchup against the red-hot Spurs set for Sunday. Dallas was missing Chandler Parsons (knee) coming into Saturday's tilt and lost another starter when Rajon Rondo left the game with a hyperextended knee. J.J Barea and Devin Harris filled in at point guard for the injured Rondo and combined for 20 points and five assists. The Mavericks struggled from three point range, going just 3-for-16 from beyond the arc. Dallas will have three days off to get healthy before returning to action Wednesday against Phoenix. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Golden State,Warriors,American Airlines Center,63,13,46,31,3.0,15.0,33.0,77.0,31.0,46.0,41.0,14.0,14.0,12.0,34.0,37.0,87.0,19.0,28.0,52.0,27.0,13.0,Richard Jefferson,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,27,Harrison Barnes,10.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,27,Dirk Nowitzki,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Draymond Green,6.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,29,Tyson Chandler,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Andrew Bogut,11.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Monta Ellis,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,32,Klay Thompson,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,17.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,27,Rajon Rondo,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18,Stephen Curry,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,27,Al-Farouq Aminu,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,30,Justin Holiday,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,9,Amar'e Stoudemire,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Andre Iguodala,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,16.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,28,Devin Harris,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,23,Shaun Livingston,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,J.J.

												The Orlando Magic (24-53) snapped the Milwaukee Bucks’ (38-39) two-game winning streak with a 97-90 victory, propelling them to a two-game winning streak of their own and three games behind the Los Angeles Lakers for the fourth-worst record in the league.Coach James Borrego ran an eight-man rotation, and six of them scored at least 10 points. Rookie Aaron Gordon recorded his first career double-double, accumulating 10 points, a career-high 12 rebounds, two blocks, and one assist in 29 minutes. Both Borrego and Rookie of the Year contender Elfrid Payton were assessed a technical foul. Payton hit his lone free-throw attempt and sank a three-pointer, converting 88 percent of his free throws over the past nine contests. He added 10 points, 11 assists, three rebounds, three steals and one block. Victor Oladipo followed a Friday’s 4-of-19 performance with a 6-of-19 shooting display. Tobias Harris, former Buck, scored 23 points, corralled 10 rebounds, blocked three shots, dished two assists, nabbed a steal and hit five three-pointers in 41 minutes.The loss still gives the Bucks a two and a half game lead over the seven seed Brooklyn Nets with five games remaining. It also eliminates them from moving any higher than the six seed as the Washington Wizards hold a six-game lead. Giannis Antetokounmpo left briefly due to a nasal contusion and ended the game shooting 3-of-12. The shooting slump snapped a streak of 14 straight games scoring double figures. Michael Carter-Williams missed out on a triple-double, notching eight points, 10 rebounds, nine assists and two steals in 34 minutes. Ersan Ilyasova scored 11 of his team-high 18 points in the first quarter. John Henson blocked three shots in 25 minutes and scored at least 10 points for the third straight game. The Magic commence a three-game homestand Wednesday against the three seed Chicago Bulls. The Milwaukee Bucks conclude a two-game homestand Wednesday against the two seed Cleveland Cavaliers. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Orlando,Magic,Fiserv Forum,24,53,38,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Giannis Antetokounmpo,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Tobias Harris,10.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,23.0,8.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,40,Ersan Ilyasova,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,26,Dewayne Dedmon,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Zaza Pachulia,5.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Nikola Vucevic,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,10.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,Khris Middleton,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,33,Victor Oladipo,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,19.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,36,Michael Carter-Williams,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,34,Elfrid Payton,3.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,40,O.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (51-26) defeated the Denver Nuggets (28-49), 107-92. Ty Lawson was scratched prior to tip with a sore right forearm and Danilo Gallinari rested the second night of a back-to-back.Coach Doc Rivers didn’t remove his starters until the three-minute mark of the fourth quarter. Each member of the starting unit scored in double figures. The win pulled the Clippers to within a game of the three seed Memphis Grizzlies and half a game ahead of the six seed San Antonio Spurs. Defensive Player of the Year candidate DeAndre Jordan finished with 14 points, 22 rebounds, three blocks and two assists in 34 minutes. However, his 3-of-6 shooting dropped his yearly average to 70.4 percent from the field. He still leads the league in rebounding. Matt Barnes converted 2-of-10 three-pointers and J.J. Redick was slightly better at 4-of-10 from distance. Chris Paul, aspiring Most Valuable Player, contributed 23 points, nine assists, five rebounds, two steals, four three-pointers and just one turnover. He leads the league in assists and assist-to-turnover ratio. The Nuggets fell behind 24-6 in the first seven minutes and never recovered. J.J. Hickson started in Gallinari’s absence, tallying seven points and six rebounds in 24 minutes. Jameer Nelson started the game at point guard but injured his hip and left before halftime. Erick Green replaced Nelson in the second half starting lineup and scored 11 points. Wilson Chandler scored a team-high 17 points on 15 shots in 34 minutes and Randy Foye registered the team’s only block. Neophytes Jusuf Nurkic and Will Barton each shot 3-of-9 from the field and combined for 19 points. Kenneth Faried recorded three assists for the first time since March 1st, supplemented by 10 points and 14 rebounds in 34 minutes.The Clippers technically play a road game when they face the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, concluding a three-game road trip before they turn around and host the Lakers two days later. The Nuggets have three days off before hosting the Lakers, the second game of a four-game homestand. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Los Angeles,Clippers,Pepsi Center,51,26,28,49,6.0,22.0,32.0,84.0,20.0,29.0,43.0,20.0,15.0,13.0,33.0,34.0,78.0,25.0,40.0,45.0,24.0,11.0,Wilson Chandler,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,34,Matt Barnes,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,10.0,2.0,31,Kenneth Faried,14.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,34,Blake Griffin,4.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,25,JJ Hickson,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,DeAndre Jordan,22.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,14.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Randy Foye,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,35,JJ Redick,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,8.0,17.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,32,Jameer Nelson,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,12,Chris Paul,5.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,23.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,31,Will Barton,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,20,Austin Rivers,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Jusuf Nurkic,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Glen Davis,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Gary Harris,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,19,Spencer Hawes,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,11,Joffrey Lauvergne,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Lester Hudson,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Erick Green,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,25,Hedo Turkoglu,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,14

												The Phoenix Suns (39-38) escaped with an 87-85 win over the Utah Jazz (34-42). Rodney Hood missed the game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. He was potentially fouled, but the official ruled otherwise.The Suns moved to three and a half games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final playoff spot with five games remaining. Gerald Green scored 24 points in just 22 minutes for the first time since November 26th. After three straight double-figure scoring games, rookie T.J. Warren was limited to four points with Green putting on a show. Brandan Wright continues to start for the injured Alex Len, supplying 14 points, three rebounds, four blocks, three steals and one assist in 33 minutes. Trey Burke was dealing with back issues and didn’t play. Dante Exum was joined in the starting lineup by fellow rookie Rodney Hood, who was cleared of concussion symptoms after missing the previous game. Hood replaced Joe Ingles in the starting lineup and scored 17 points. He entered the game shooting 47 percent from the field since the All-Star break. Gordon Hayward scored 21 points on 18 shots and Rudy Gobert, potential Defensive Player of the Year, provided eight points, 15 rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 38 minutes.The Suns engage in a four-game road trip Tuesday beginning against the Atlanta Hawks. The Jazz conclude a two-game, two-day road trip when they play the Sacramento Kings on Sunday before hosting them three days later.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (50-26) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (41-35), 99-90, on Saturday at the Moda Center. One night after clinching the Northwest Division title, Portland would have had every right to rest its starters. However, the Trail Blazers are battling with the Clippers for a top-four seed in the Western Conference, so they deployed their regular starting lineup against a Pelicans team that is fighting for the eighth seed. The Trail Blazers dominated the Pelicans on the boards, out-rebounding them 51-35. The Pelicans had a chance to grab sole possession of the eighth spot in the West with a win, but they mustered just 18 points in the fourth quarter to fall to the Trail Blazers for the third time this season. New Orleans had won four straight coming into Saturday's contest, but a two-minute scoring drought in the fourth quarter cost it a fifth consecutive victory. Anthony Davis was held in check by LaMarcus Aldridge, finishing with 19 points on 8-of-20 shooting to go with nine rebounds. Davis hadn't been held to less than 20 points or 10 rebounds since March 10 against Brooklyn. The Pelicans have a very difficult remaining schedule with meetings against the Warriors and Memphis on back-to-back nights starting Tuesday. Portland has now won six of its last seven games to move to 50-26 on the season with six games remaining. LaMarcus Aldridge had another productive night with 21 points and 12 rebounds over 37 minutes of action. Chris Kaman provided a spark off the bench with 16 points and 11 rebounds. The Trail Blazers will head east to face the Nets on Monday before returning home to host the Timberwolves on Wednesday. 											",Portland,Trail Blazers,New Orleans,Pelicans,Moda Center,41,35,50,26,,,,,,,,,,7.0,16.0,39.0,85.0,5.0,10.0,35.0,18.0,9.0,Nicolas Batum,5.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,36,Quincy Pondexter,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,27,LaMarcus Aldridge,12.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,36,Anthony Davis,9.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,19.0,8.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Robin Lopez,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Omer Asik,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Arron Afflalo,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,33,Tyreke Evans,7.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,10.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,37,Damian Lillard,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,19.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,34,Eric Gordon,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,16.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,35,Chris Kaman,11.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Alexis Ajinca,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,CJ McCollum,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,26,Dante Cunningham,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Steve Blake,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,13,Norris Cole,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,25,Meyers Leonard,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,11,Ryan Anderson,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,18,Allen Crabbe,,,,,,,,,,,,Toney Douglas,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9

												The Indiana Pacers (33-43) throttled the Charlotte Hornets (32-43) 93-74 on Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. This game was a must-win for both teams as Charlotte and Indiana are battling for one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. While Indiana wasn't exactly overwhelming on the offensive end, Charlotte was dreadful. The Hornets shot 30 percent from the floor for much of the game, but were able to bump that number up to 35 percent when the game was already well out of hand. With the win, the Pacers locked up the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Hornets, which could be the deciding factor for the eighth spot in the East. Charlotte was already missing Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist coming into this contest, and Al Jefferson missed the second half with continued knee soreness. The dearth of depth was ultimately too much to overcome for the Hornets, and their usual scorers did not come close to their usual offensive production. Kemba Walker was held to six points on 1-of-9 shooting and Mo Williams had nine points on 4-of-11 shooting. The Hornets will look to bounce back Saturday against the 76ers before a crucial matchup with the Heat on Tuesday. Indiana was able to pull away in the second and third quarters by playing a suffocating brand of defense. The Pacers allowed just 22 points over those two quarters, while pouring in 48 points themselves. Rodney Stuckey and C.J Watson provided solid scoring numbers off the bench, combining for 28 points. The Pacers leap-frogged the Hornets in the standings, but remain 1.5 games behind the Celtics and Heat and two games behind the Nets. Indiana only plays one of those teams, Miami, down the stretch. That matchup is on the docket for Sunday in Indiana. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Charlotte,Hornets,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,32,43,33,43,8.0,16.0,32.0,76.0,11.0,16.0,48.0,17.0,19.0,3.0,13.0,22.0,69.0,14.0,20.0,37.0,15.0,16.0,Solomon Hill,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,26,Jeffery Taylor,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,David West,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Marvin Williams,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,29,Roy Hibbert,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,15,Al Jefferson,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,CJ Miles,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,28,Gerald Henderson,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,27,George Hill,6.0,10.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,28,Kemba Walker,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,27,Rodney Stuckey,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,22,Bismack Biyombo,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Ian Mahinmi,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Mo Williams,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,25,Luis Scola,11.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,PJ Hairston,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10,C.J.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (38-38) defeated the Boston Celtics (34-42) 110-101 on Friday.O.J. Mayo came off the bench and had a huge game for Milwaukee. He had his best game since coming back from a hamstring injury that forced him to miss twelve games between Feb. 24 and Mar. 24. In 29 minutes he put up 24 points, six assists, five rebounds and two steals against in Boston. As is the case on most nights recently, Michael Carter-Williams had a rough shooting night, coupled with a high turnover rate. He had eight points of 3-for-8 shooting to go along with a whopping six turnovers on Friday. However he was able to contribute in other areas to help lead his team back to a .500 record. He finished with seven assists, five rebounds, five steals and two blocks.Much like the Bucks, the Celtics have a high-scoring sixth man off the bench who lead them in points. Isaiah Thomas had 23 points and six assists in 26 minutes, but did turn the ball over five times. Evan Turner had three turnovers himself; he followed up his triple-double on Wednesday with a six points, six rebounds and six assists in a not so heavenly performance. Boston is trying to scratch and claw their way to a playoff birth but currently sit on the outside looking in at the Eastern Conference playoff picture.The Celtics will head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Saturday, as the Bucks will host the Orlando Magic.

												The Brooklyn Nets (35-40) beat the Toronto Raptors (45-31), 114-109. Amir Johnson left the game early with a sprained right ankle. Alan Anderson exited in the fourth quarter after spraining his left ankle. Each team boasted three 20-point scorers.The Nets extended their season-long winning streak to six games. They pulled one game ahead of the Miami Heat and remained two and a ahlf games behind the six seeded Milwaukee Bucks. Deron Williams tied Baron Davis with 6,025 assists all-time, good for 32nd in NBA history. He also helped out with a season-high 31 points and five three-pointers in 38 minutes, playing the entire second half. Brook Lopez corralled 17 rebounds, 10 offensive and scored 30 points in 44 minutes. The third amigo, Thaddeus Young, contributed 29 points, including the go-ahead tip-in with 22.2 seconds left, and four steals in 37 minutes. Kyle Lowry missed his fifth straight game and seven of the last eight with back spasms. DeMar DeRozan nearly recorded a triple-double, compiling 27 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, and one steal in 41 minutes. Potential Sixth Man of the Year, Lou Williams, tallied 23 points and five three-pointers in 33 minutes off the bench. He leads all reserves in total points. Jonas Valanciunas scored 21 points, first time since March 4th, and played 36 minutes, first time since February 23rd. He threw up an ill-advised three-pointer, down five with two seconds remaining. The Raptors host the Boston Celtics on Saturday, the second night of a back-to-back. The Nets play their fifth game in seven days when they take on the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Toronto,Raptors,Barclays Center,45,31,35,40,5.0,16.0,46.0,88.0,17.0,23.0,41.0,21.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,Joe Johnson,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,36,Terrence Ross,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,21,Thaddeus Young,6.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,29.0,12.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,36,Amir Johnson,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Brook Lopez,17.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,13.0,24.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,43,Jonas Valanciunas,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,35,Markel Brown,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,DeMar DeRozan,8.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,27.0,10.0,20.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,41,Deron Williams,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,31.0,11.0,18.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,38,Greivis Vasquez,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,33,Alan Anderson,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,26,Lou Williams,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,32,Earl Clark,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,James Johnson,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Mason Plumlee,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Patrick Patterson,9.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,29,Jarrett Jack,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Tyler Hansbrough,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Bojan Bogdanovic,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,17,Bruno Caboclo,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Chicago Bulls (46-30) beat the Detroit Pistons (29-47) 88-82 on Friday.Pau Gasol led the Bulls in a solid team effort against Detroit. His team held the Pistons to just nine points in the second quarter but couldn't quite hold them off, as they were able to make a run on the Bulls late. Gasol had 26 points, 10 rebounds and one block, and his teammate Joakim Noah put on a passing display from the center position with ten assists. Jimmy Butler put another nice game together, as he is very likely to receive a huge payday this summer. Derrick Rose and Kirk Hinrich were both ruled out for Friday's tilt, as they are recovering from knee injuries. The Bull's production at point guard suffered with E'Twaun Moore and Aaron Brooks combining for just ten points on 4-of-16 shooting from the field to go along with three assists in 48 minutes played. Chicago has locked up a playoff spot but still is still looking to improve their seed with just a couple weeks remaining in the season.Andre Drummond has solidified himself as a dominant force in the NBA this season. Even against a stout Chicago defense he was able to record 14 points, 22 rebounds and six blocks before fouling out after 43 minutes of action. Over his past five he's averaged 19.4 points, 13.4 rebounds, 2.2 blocks and 1.2 steals a game. His new point guard Reggie Jackson has been a great addition for the Pistons. He put up a nice game on Friday with 22 points and nine assists, but was bit by the turnover bug, as he recorded eight of them. The Bulls only had ten total turnovers as a team. Detroit has not been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs and will have to make a strong run the rest of the way if they want to take one of the final spots in the Eastern Conference. The Hornets, Pacers and Celtics all would not make the playoffs if they began tomorrow. Each of them has better records than the Pistons.Detroit will head home for Saturday's game with the Miami Heat, who currently holds the eighth seed that the Pistons so desperately covet. The Bulls will have a day off to gear up for their big game with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (52-24) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (42-34), 100-92, on Friday at the FedEX Forum. Memphis came into this game trailing idle Houston by a half game, needing a win to keep pace. The Grizzlies attacked the paint, knowing that Serge Ibaka wasn't available to protect the rim. Memphis ended up scoring 60 points in the paint, with Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol doing most of the damage. Neither team was able to score from the perimeter, as the Thunder and Grizzlies were a combined 8-for-38 from beyond the arc. Russell Westbrook had trouble solving Memphis' defense, finishing with 18 points on 5-of-20 shooting from the field. With Oklahoma City's loss Friday, Portland secured the Northwest Division title. Oklahoma City has now dropped four of its last five, leaving the door open for New Orleans to move within a half game of it should the Pelicans win Friday. Enes Kanter had a good outing on the offensive end with 24 points to go with 17 rebounds, but his defensive struggles attributed to Memphis' success in the paint. The Thunder will look to bounce back Sunday when they host the Rockets. Memphis moved back into a tie with Houston for the second seed in the West with the victory Friday. Jeff Green not only led the team in scoring with 22 points, but his defense on Russell Westbrook limited the MVP candidate's impact. The Grizzlies have now won two straight after a three-game losing skid last week allowed the Rockets to climb the standings. Memphis will host Washington on Saturday before getting three full days of rest prior to its matchup with New Orleans on Wednesday. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Oklahoma City,Thunder,FedExForum,42,34,52,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jeff Green,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,22.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,37,Kyle Singler,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,28,Zach Randolph,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,30,Enes Kanter,17.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,11.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,Marc Gasol,6.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,19.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,37,Steven Adams,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35,Courtney Lee,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,31,Dion Waiters,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,36,Mike Conley,5.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,35,Russell Westbrook,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,5.0,20.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,37,Nick Calathes,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Anthony Morrow,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,33,Beno Udrih,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,17,Mitch McGary,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Kosta Koufos,11.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,D.J.

Restricted free agent to be, Tobias Harris, added 25 points, 12 rebounds and four three-pointers. Rookie of the Year hopeful Elfrid Payton missed a triple-double by four rebounds or six steals.

Last year’s Rookie of the Year runner-up Victor Oladipo was held to 4-of-19 shooting and missed all six three-pointers.The Timberwolves are two games behind the New York Knicks for the worst record in the league. Kevin Martin returned to the starting lineup after missing six games with a strained hamstring. He was one of six Timberwolves to score at least 10 points, producing 12 points on 12 shots to go along with three steals and three assists. Andrew Wiggins, the Rookie of the Year frontrunner, scored 22 points in 37 minutes. He’s played in all 76 games this season and is tied for third in total minutes played (2,720). Justin Hamilton helped out in almost every category, registering 14 points, a team-high nine rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block in 38 minutes as he continues to start for the concussed Gorgui Dieng.The Magic play their second road game in as many days when the face the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (50-26) continued their dominant play Friday with a 123-93 thrashing of the Denver Nuggets (28-48) at the AT&T Center. With the middle of the West's playoff picture wide open, San Antonio is making a push for a top-four seed. The Spurs took over from the early going, taking a 45-25 lead into the second quarter. Their ball movement was too much for the Nuggets to handle as the Spurs dished out 33 assists on 47 made baskets. The Nuggets were also hampered by 18 turnovers against 17 assists. With Friday's win, the Spurs completed the season sweep over the Nuggets. Denver appeared to be turning things around under interim coach Melvin Hunt with a four game winning streak in mid-March, but has struggled since then. The Nuggets are just 2-7 since that winning streak, including a current three game skid. Danilo Gallinari bounced back from a couple of shaky outings to post a team-high 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting. J.J Hickson (knee) returned from a one game absence, finishing with four points and six rebounds over 24 minutes off the bench. The Nuggets will play their next two games in Los Angeles, starting with a matchup with the Clippers on Saturday. San Antonio has regained its status as a team to be reckoned with in the West, going 9-1 over its last 10 games. No one player lit up the scoreboard Friday, but the Spurs had five players (including three reserves) score in double figures. The Spurs shot 55 percent from the floor and 41 percent from beyond the arc as they were able to put the game out of reach. San Antonio will get a chance to prove itself against the West's top team, Golden State, on Sunday. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Denver,Nuggets,AT&T Center,28,48,50,26,13.0,28.0,43.0,72.0,13.0,15.0,34.0,28.0,14.0,6.0,17.0,39.0,81.0,7.0,11.0,33.0,15.0,18.0,Kawhi Leonard,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,9.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,21,Wilson Chandler,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,28,Tim Duncan,7.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,Danilo Gallinari,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,30,Tiago Splitter,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Kenneth Faried,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,20,Danny Green,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,9.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,20,Randy Foye,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,19,Tony Parker,0.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Ty Lawson,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,24,Manu Ginobili,6.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,19,Jameer Nelson,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,16,Boris Diaw,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,25,JJ Hickson,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Aron Baynes,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,18.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Jusuf Nurkic,9.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Cory Joseph,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Will Barton,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,26,Marco Belinelli,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,20,Gary Harris,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,13

												The New Orleans Pelicans (41-34) defeated the Sacramento Kings (26-49) 101-95 on Friday.The Pelicans had dropped four in a row but are now on a four-game win streak after their victory at Sleep Train Arena. Tyreke Evans was just one assist shy of a triple-double. He had 19 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. Anthony Davis had 20 points and ten rebounds in another stellar game for the ""Smoothie King Superstar"". New Orleans is just a half a game back of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth seed in the Western Conference. They could finish as high as the seventh seed but are in danger of missing the playoffs once again.DeMarcus Cousins put up an awe-inspiring performance in another tough loss. Cousins had 24 points, 20 rebounds and 13 assists, all of which were game-highs. He's now put up back-to-back games of 20-plus points, 20-plus rebounds and 10-plus assists from the center position. Russell Westbrook isn't the only one playing out of his mind right now, as Cousins has averaged 27.8 points, 18.0 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 3.5 blocks and 1.8 steals over his last four games. The Kings will welcome the Utah Jazz to Sacramento on Sunday, as New Orleans will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (49-26) routed the Los Angeles Lakers (20-55) at the Staples Center on Friday by a score of 107-77. Portland clinched the Northwest Division shortly before tip-off after Oklahoma City fell to Memphis, but that didn't stop the Trail Blazers from putting the exclamation point on the night. The Trail Blazers started hot and finished hot, outscoring the Lakers 26-12 in the first quarter and 33-14 in the fourth. Second-year guard C.J McCollum poured in a team-high 27 points in 27 minutes off the bench. With Friday's win, the Trail Blazers completed the season sweep over the Lakers.Portland hadn't won a division title outright since the 1998-99 season when it was a member of the Pacific Division. Damian Lillard posted 20 points on an efficient 8-of-15 shooting performance that included going 4-of-8 from beyond the arc. The Trail Blazers currently hold the fourth spot in the Western Conference, but have one less win than the Clippers and Spurs. The division title looms large in this case as the Warriors have already clinched the Clippers' division and the Spurs have an uphill climb to unseat the Grizzlies and Rockets in the Southwest. The Trail Blazers will play the second half of a back-to-back set Saturday when they host the Pelicans.Los Angeles' season-long woes continued Friday with another blowout loss in front of the home crowd. Friday's defeat tied a not-so-prestigious franchise record for most losses in a single season. The Lakers are almost assured to have one of the bottom-five records in the league this season, which should allow them to have a top-five pick in the upcoming draft. Jordan Clarkson was again one of the few bright spots for the Lakers as he led them in scoring with 27 points. Clarkson also pulled down seven rebounds and dished out five assists in 35 minutes of action. The Lakers will kick off their ""home-and-home"" set against the Clippers on Sunday. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Portland,Trail Blazers,Staples Center,49,26,20,55,3.0,12.0,28.0,78.0,10.0,17.0,42.0,12.0,9.0,10.0,24.0,40.0,80.0,11.0,11.0,50.0,21.0,7.0,Wesley Johnson,15.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,37,Nicolas Batum,10.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,26,Ryan Kelly,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,37,LaMarcus Aldridge,8.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,29,Tarik Black,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Robin Lopez,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Jeremy Lin,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Arron Afflalo,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,15.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,32,Jordan Clarkson,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,12.0,20.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,34,Damian Lillard,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,15.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,28,Jabari Brown,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,29,Chris Kaman,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Jordan Hill,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,CJ McCollum,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,27.0,10.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,27,Carlos Boozer,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Steve Blake,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Ed Davis,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Meyers Leonard,11.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Robert Sacre,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Joel Freeland,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (49-27) defeated the Miami Heat (34-41) 114-88 on Thursday at the Quicken Loans Arena.Cleveland seized control from the early going Thursday, but its road to victory got significantly easier when Dwayne Wade left the game midway through the second quarter. Wade slipped and took an awkward fall, suffering a bruised left knee that sidelined him for the remainder of the game. Cleveland allowed Miami to get as close as 10 points in the third before completely pulling away. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving each poured in 23 points to help notch the Cavaliers' 17th consecutive home win. Miami was already a banged up unit coming into Thursday's game, but losing Dwayne Wade for any amount of time could put its playoff chances in serious jeopardy. Thursday's loss drops Miami to the eighth spot in the East, with teams like Boston, Charlotte, and Indiana all within striking distance. Wade's injury occured to the same knee that he had drained last Saturday, leaving his status ahead of Saturday's game in Detroit in question. The Heat did have a key player return to the starting lineup Thursday with Hassan Whiteside getting the nod at center. Whiteside finished with 17 points and eight rebounds. The Heat have a couple games with major playoff implications on the horizon with matchups against the Pacers and Hornets following Saturday's game. Cleveland didn't have its full complement of players available for this game, but its reserves rose to the occasion. Kevin Love sat out with a sore back, but Tristan Thompson was a difference maker with his increased playing time. Thompson pulled down 15 rebounds to go with eight points and Iman Shumpert had one of his best games as a Cavalier, pouring in 17 points on 7-of-12 shooting. Cleveland will have a couple days off before returning to action Sunday against Chicago. 											",Cleveland,Cavaliers,Miami,Heat,Quicken Loans Arena,34,41,49,27,15.0,35.0,40.0,80.0,19.0,25.0,42.0,22.0,14.0,7.0,20.0,32.0,73.0,17.0,21.0,36.0,25.0,16.0,LeBron James,8.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,23.0,9.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,35,Luol Deng,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,36,James Jones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,22,Henry Walker,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,Timofey Mozgov,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Hassan Whiteside,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,JR Smith,3.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,33,Dwyane Wade,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,12,Kyrie Irving,1.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,17.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,35,Goran Dragic,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,32,Iman Shumpert,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,26,Michael Beasley,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,13,Tristan Thompson,15.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Mario Chalmers,2.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,26,Matthew Dellavedova,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,22,Tyler Johnson,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25,Kendrick Perkins,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Chris Andersen,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Joe Harris,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3,James Ennis III,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,27

												The Houston Rockets (52-24) edged out the Dallas Mavericks (46-30), 108-101, on Thursday at the American Airlines Center. In a back-and-forth contest between division rivals, Houston saved its best for the fourth quarter to put the game out of Dallas' reach. Monta Ellis couldn't shake off his shooting slump at a crucial moment in the fourth, missing an open look from three that could have tied the game with under 30 seconds remaining. Houston's James Harden didn't quite sustain the momentum from Wednesday's 51-point outing against Sacramento, but was still able to put up 24 points along with six assists and four rebounds. The Rockets clinched the season series over the Mavericks 3-1, but it might not be the last time these teams meet this season. Houston moved into second place in the West with Thursday's win while Dallas stayed put in the seventh spot. Houston didn't need James Harden to be at his best to win this game, as several Rockets players made major contributions. Trevor Ariza had another all-around performance with 19 points, six assists, six rebounds, and two steals and Crey Brewer added 14 points off the bench. Dwight Howard continues to be on a minutes restriction as he works his way back into game shape, but was able to post eight points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes on the floor. The Rockets are now a half game ahead of the Grizzlies for the second seed in the West, but staying in that spot will be a tough task. Houston will return to action Sunday in Oklahoma City before a kicking off a home-and-home set with San Antonio on Wednesday. Dallas notched an important win over eighth-seeded Oklahoma City on Wednesday, but couldn't close out Houston on Thursday. The Mavericks took a seven point lead into the fourth, but were outscored 31-18 in the final stanza. Monta Ellis had 19 points on the night, but that came on 7-of-21 shooting from the floor--including 0-for-7 from beyond the arc. Chandler Parsons exited the game in the third quarter with knee soreness and did not return. The Mavericks will be off Friday before hosting Golden State on Saturday. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Houston,Rockets,American Airlines Center,52,24,46,30,7.0,25.0,36.0,81.0,17.0,25.0,41.0,21.0,13.0,11.0,31.0,34.0,75.0,29.0,40.0,50.0,22.0,17.0,Chandler Parsons,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,25,Trevor Ariza,6.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,38,Dirk Nowitzki,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,31,Terrence Jones,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,22,Tyson Chandler,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Dwight Howard,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Monta Ellis,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,21.0,0.0,7.0,4.0,37,James Harden,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,6.0,15.0,2.0,8.0,5.0,38,Rajon Rondo,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Jason Terry,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,29,Amar'e Stoudemire,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Josh Smith,12.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,15.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,31,Al-Farouq Aminu,8.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,26,Joey Dorsey,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Devin Harris,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,22,Pablo Prigioni,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,19,J.J.

												The Golden State Warriors (62-13) narrowly edged out the Phoenix Suns (38-38) on Thursday in a 107-106 thriller at the Oracle Arena. It isn't often that Golden State gets tested at home, but a Phoenix team clinging to slim playoff chances gave Golden State all it could handle Thursday. Phoenix trailed for much of the game, but took an 89-88 lead with 5:33 to go. A back-and-forth battle ensued with both teams trading haymakers. It looked like Golden State was going to escape after Steph Curry swished a three to take a one-point lead with eight seconds to go, but Eric Bledsoe answered with a crafty move at the basket to give Phoenix the lead. Coming out of a timeout, Golden State called on Harrison Barnes, who delivered the winning basket with under a second remaining. The Suns have now lost five games on buzzer beating shots, but this one may have ended their playoff hopes for good.Phoenix desperately needed a win Thursday, having lost four straight coming into its matchup with Golden State. Every starter scored in double-figures, led by Eric Bledsoe with 18 points. Rookie T.J Warren had a big outing with 17 points off the bench. Despite the solid all-around performances, Phoenix couldn't hold on as it suffered another gut-wrenching loss. The Suns will return home to host the Jazz on Saturday. Golden State has the Pacific Division and the West's number one seed locked up, but still played like its season was on the line. The Warriors rallied from a big deficit against the Clippers on Tuesday, and followed it up with another clutch performance. Stephen Curry showed once again why he's an MVP candidate, canning six three-pointers on his way to scoring 28 points. The Warriors were missing Draymond Green again Thursday, which allowed David Lee to make his second straight start. Lee finished with seven points and six rebounds over 21 minutes. Golden State will start a three-game road trip Saturday in Dallas. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Phoenix,Suns,Chase Center,38,38,62,13,10.0,26.0,41.0,90.0,11.0,17.0,49.0,29.0,13.0,5.0,18.0,41.0,88.0,17.0,26.0,47.0,25.0,11.0,Harrison Barnes,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,23,Marcus Morris Sr.,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,25,David Lee,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Markieff Morris,12.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,33,Andrew Bogut,9.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Brandan Wright,12.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Klay Thompson,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,14.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,32,P.J.

												The Hornets (31-42) defeated the Pistons (29-45) 102-78 at Time Warner Cable Arena on Wednesday.The Pistons had a tough time shooting all night long, hitting 35 percent of their shots from the field and just 23 percent from beyond the arc. The Hornets jumped out to an eight-point lead in the first quarter, one they extended to 11 points by halftime. In the fourth quarter, the Hornets outscored the Pistons 29-16 to complete the rout. The Hornets shared the love, with six players scoring in double digits. Marvin Williams was the Hornets' leading scorer with 18 points (7-11 FG, 3-6 3Pt), to go with six rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 29 minutes. Kemba Walker had 17 points (7-13 FG, 2-2 3Pt), nine rebounds, three assists and four blocks in 33 minutes. Mo Williams (knee) contributed 13 points (6-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt), two rebounds, six assists and one steal in 25 minutes. Al Jefferson (knee) played through the pain, putting up 11 points (4-12 FG), to go with nine rebounds, three assists and four blocks in 26 minutes. The Pistons leading scorer, Jodie Meeks, came off the bench. He had 15 points (6-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt) and five rebounds in 34 minutes. Andre Drummond had 13 points (6-15 FG), nine rebounds and two steals in 28 minutes. Reggie Jackson only recorded nine points (3-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt), but he did have seven rebounds and eight assists in 29 minutes. Jackson, whose production has fallen off over the last two games, is battling an illness. Wednesday's win was crucial for the Hornets, who have struggled down the stretch. They're currently eleventh in the Eastern Conference, 1.5 games behind the eighth-place Nets. The Pistons are now five games behind the Nets in the East, and their playoff chances look bleak. The Hornets lead the season series with the Pistons 2-1. They will play once more on Apr. 10. 											",Charlotte,Hornets,Detroit,Pistons,Spectrum Center,29,46,32,42,8.0,21.0,36.0,87.0,17.0,24.0,55.0,21.0,8.0,5.0,21.0,30.0,86.0,11.0,18.0,51.0,23.0,12.0,Jeffery Taylor,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,21,Caron Butler,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,26,Marvin Williams,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,28,Anthony Tolliver,8.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,31,Al Jefferson,9.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Andre Drummond,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Gerald Henderson,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,30,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,14,Kemba Walker,6.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,33,Reggie Jackson,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,16.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,28,PJ Hairston,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,22,Joel Anthony,7.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Mo Williams,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,24,Jodie Meeks,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,33,Bismack Biyombo,10.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,John Lucas III,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,19,Jason Maxiell,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Tayshaun Prince,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,20,Brian Roberts,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,Shawne Williams,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12

												The San Antonio Spurs (49-26) defeated the Orlando Magic (22-53) 103-91 on Wednesday.The Spurs took did some early damage to the Magic and that put them in a situation where they could rest their starters. Tony Parker led the San Antonio starters with 22 minutes; he had seven points and four assists. Tim Duncan played just 12 minutes and scored six points to go with three rebounds and a block. With the starters getting some much-needed rest, it was up to the reserves to put nail the coffin on Orlando's chances of getting their 13th home victory of the season. Aron Baynes led the Spurs with 18 points in 24 minutes off the bench. He and Marco Belinelli, as well as Manu Ginobli were the key cogs in the Spurs' bench brigade on Wednesday. Belinelli put in 12 points in a team-high 30 minutes. Ginobli had a plus 27 in the plus/minus statistic in just 18 minutes played.Orlando's starters played very well against the Spurs, but didn't get enough help from their reserves to make it a game. The Magic got good all-around games from Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and Elfrid Payton. Vucevic had five assists from the center position as well as three blocked shots. Oladipo put in a game-high 24 points to go along with seven assists and six rebounds. Payton continued his stellar rookie season with seven, assists, seven rebounds, four steals and one block. His shot has been much improved over the past few months, he showed that against San Antonio going 7-for-15 from the field.

												The Washington Wizards (42-33) beat the Philadelphia 76ers (18-58) 106-93 on Wednesday.The Wizards made quick work of the 76ers, putting them in a 10-point hole to start the second quarter, and then pushed that to a 23-point lead to end the first half. Marcin Gortat dominated the inside against the Sixers, he put in 10 of his 11 shots for a team-high 23 points. He also had team-highs with 14 rebounds and two blocks in his 31 minutes of action. The Washington backcourt was hard to handle on Wednesday, Bradley Beal and John Wall combined for 33 points, 20 rebounds and nine assists. Washington has already locked up a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, their next objective is to try and get home-court advantage for the first round. They are currently hot on the heels of the fourth place Toronto Raptors.Ish Smith has supplanted himself as the starting point guard for the 76ers, since they sent away Michael Carter-Williams in a deadline trade. Smith led his team with 23 points on 11-for-17 shooting to go along with three steals. He and sensational rookie Nerlens Noel combined for 37 points, but unfortunately for them, the other three starters combined for a lousy seven points in 44 minutes played. Isaiah Canaan came in and stepped it up to help out the struggling starting crew. Canaan poured in 18 points in 22 minutes before injuring his ankle. He also had six assists, three rebounds and two steals before suffering the injury. Canaan did not return to floor after being diagnosed with a sprained right ankle. Philadelphia has lost four straight and six of their last seven. Their sights are set on the future as the 2014-2015 season winds down.The 76ers will play the Hornets in Charlotte on Saturday. The Wizards will host the New York Knicks on Friday.

												The Boston Celtics (34-41) defeated the Indiana Pacers (32-43) 100-87 on Wednesday.Evan Turner turned in his third triple-double of the season in this matchup of two teams knocking on the door of playoff births. He had 13 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in 35 minutes of action. Turner's shot wasn't falling, he went 6-for-17 from the floor, but obviously found other ways to help lead his team to victory. The Celtics' two-headed center approach had success against the Pacers. The tandem of Tyler Zeller and Kelly Olynyk combined for 38 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals in 46 minutes. It was a shock that Olynyk was able to play after receiving an inadvertent elbow in the eye from Shavlik Randolph during shootaround earlier in the day. Olynyk showed true grit, and knocked three of his four shots from beyond the arc. His sight must've been just fine. The Celtics have won two very important games against the Pacers and Charlotte Hornets, the two teams they are battling with in search of reaching one of the final playoff spots.George Hill played a solid game in a losing effort; he scored a game-high 21 points to go along with six assists and six rebounds. He was on fire, hitting nine of his eleven shots from the field. He didn't get much help from his supporting cast, as the Pacers are a little banged up at the moment. C.J. Miles sprained his ankle on Tuesday but was able to score 12 points in 29 minutes on Wednesday. Rodney Stuckey has been dealing with a sore calf as well as a wrist injury he suffered over the weekend. He too was able to play. Stuckey scored 16 points to lead the Indiana bench attack in 20 minutes of play. Much like the Celtics, the Pacers have their eyes on the Brooklyn Nets and Miami Heat, the two teams that hold the final two playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday, as the Pacers will welcome the Charlotte Hornets to town.

Kirk Hinrich left Wednesday's games with a knee injury after he recorded three points and a steal in 10 minutes, he did not return. The Bucks found a way to cool down rookie Nikola Mirotic. Mirotic had an insane month of March where he averaged more than 20 points and eight rebounds a contest. He had just six points on 3-for-10 shooting to go along with six rebounds in 23 minutes in Milwaukee. The Bulls have already clinched a playoff spot but would like to gain home-court advantage for the at least the first round. As long as they keep the Washington Wizards behind them, they will do just that.The Bulls will host Reggie Jackson and the Detroit Pistons on Friday, as the Bucks will head to Boston to face-off with the Celtics.

												The Toronto Raptors (45-30) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-59) 113-99 on Wednesday.The Raptors got a good team effort in an easy win for them in Minnesota. No Toronto player garnered more than 30 minutes or scored 20 points, but seven players scored in double-figures. They were led by Louis Williams, who put in a team-high 18 points in 26 minutes off the bench. Toronto has the same record as the Chicago Bulls as they'll battle for playoff position the rest of the regular season.The banged up Wolves played just eight players against the Raptors. Probably rookie of the year Andrew Wiggins was the man against his hometown team. He put in 25 points to go along with five boards, five assists, two blocks and one steal. His teammate rookie point guard Zach LaVine had a solid game with 22 points and seven rebounds but recorded seven turnovers and just three assists. Minnesota has lost five straight, they'll play a home game on Friday before heading on a four-game west coast road trip.The Timberwolves will host the Orlando Magic on Friday, as The Raptors will head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets.

												The Utah Jazz (34-41) beat the Denver Nuggets (28-47) 98-84 on Wednesday.Rudy Gobert keeps impressing as the season winds down in April. Only three times since Feb. 20 has he failed to record double-digit rebound totals. Against the Nuggets he coupled his spectacular rebounding ability with his first 20-point game of the season. His scoring has vastly improved and has now put up six straight double-doubles. His frontcourt mate Derrick Favors was thought to be in jeopardy of missing Wednesday's tilt with a back injury, but he proved the doubters wrong and finished with 19 points and three blocks in 25 minutes of action. Dante Exum put on a passing display, recording 12 assists with three turnovers in 29 minutes. His counterpart Trey Burke came off the bench and had 12 points, five rebounds and four assists in 25 minutes. The Jazz won't make the playoffs but their strong surge of late has really improved their feeling going into the offseason with a solid young core to build off of. The Nuggets had just one player finish with more than 30 minutes played and just three who reached double-digits in scoring. Kenneth Faried had his way on the boards as usual. He had 19 points and 10 rebounds, leading his team in both categories. Will Barton provided a spark off the bench for the Nuggets. In 23 minutes he recorded 13 points, seven rebounds and two steals. Denver's lost six of their last eight; like the Jazz they won't make the playoffs, but don't seem to be heading in the right direction.  The Nuggets will head to San Antonio to face the Spurs on Friday, as the Jazz will travel to Phoenix to face-off with the Suns on Saturday.

												The Clippers (50-26) defeated the Trail Blazers (48-26) 126-122 at the Moda Center on Wednesday. The Trail Blazers led by 13 points at halftime, but the Clippers methodically crept back into the game, cutting the lead to seven points by the end of the third quarter. In the fourth, the Clippers outscored the Trail Blazers 41-30. With less than seven minutes remaining, they took the lead 100-98. Three-pointers from Blake Griffin and Chris Paul on back-to-back Clippers' possessions extended the lead to six points. With less than two minutes to go, the Clippers led by 10.

Tyreke Evans has continued to relish his role as the Pelican's point guard, he had 16 points and eight assists with zero turnovers in 28 minutes. He's put up averages of 19.5 points and 7.5 assists over his last five games. New Orleans has won three straight and hope to dethrone the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final playoff spots in the Western Conference.The Lakers got a solid performance from Jordan Clarkson but got little help from teammates, as they currently don't have a go-to guy. Clarkson led Los Angeles with 18 points and 10 assists to go along with seven rebounds in 31 minutes. The Lakers have an eye on the future as the season rolls to an end in just a couple weeks.The Lakers will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, as the Pelicans will play in Sacramento against the Kings.

												The Nets (33-40) defeated the Pacers (32-42) 111-106 at the Barclays Center on Tuesday. The Pacers reduced a 19-point second quarter deficit to just three points by halftime. The lead changed hands four times in the third quarter. Near the end of the third, the Nets went ahead by five, 84-79. The Nets maintained their lead throughout the fourth quarter. Late in the game, the Pacers came within three points, but their offense stalled for nearly two minutes. Indiana's George Hill finally hit a three pointer with 12 seconds on the clock, but, by then, it was too little too late.George Hill led the Pacers in scoring with 28 points (10-17 FG, 4-8 3Pt), to go with six rebounds and three assists in 32 minutes. Hill has been hot lately, averaging 21 points over his last five games. David West contributed 14 points (4-10 FG, 6-7 3Pt), five rebounds, six assists and one block in 27 minutes. C.J. Miles went down early in the game with a right ankle sprain. He did not return. Miles had 26 points against the Bucks on Thursday and 28 against the Mavericks on Sunday. Rodney Stuckey (wrist), who was listed as questionable headed into Tuesday's contest, did suit up and play, scoring four points off the bench in 25 minutes.Brook Lopez was the Nets' leading scorer with 24 points (11-17 FG), to go with 11 rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Lopez has been dominant over his last five games, averaging 27.8 points. Joe Johnson had 21 points (6-13 FG, 3-6 3Pt), six rebounds and four assists. Thaddeus Young (knee) returned to the starting lineup after a two-game absence, scoring eight points (4-11 FG, 0-3 3Pt).With Tuesday's win, the Nets replaced Boston as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, while also distancing themselves from the tenth-place Pacers. Boston is a half-game behind the Nets, while the Pacers are now 1.5 games back. The Nets are one game behind the seventh-place Heat, and 1.5 games behind the Bucks.The Nets have won the season series with the Pacers 2-1.

												The Atlanta Hawks (56-19) fell to the Detroit Pistons (29-45), 105-95, on Tuesday at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Both teams got off to torrid starts on the offensive end, with the Pistons opening the game shooting 10-of-11 from the floor and the Hawks hitting seven of their first 10 shots. The game remained relatively even through the first three quarters until Detroit began to pull away from Atlanta in the fourth. A 9-0 Pistons run midway through the fourth gave them a 16 point advantage to effectively put the game away. The Hawks cut into the deficit late, but the Pistons were never in any real danger of losing their lead. Despite the loss, Atlanta took the season series from Detroit 3-1.  The Hawks opted to not rest their starters for the second game of a back-to-back set Tuesday, at least officially. Four of Atlanta's reserves matched the starters' playing time with 24 minutes on the floor. Al Horford had an excellent night from the floor in his truncated outing, hitting eight of his ten field goal attempts. Dennis Schroder did not travel with the team for Tuesday's game with a toe injury, but an MRI earlier in the day revealed that it's a sprain rather than a break. The Hawks will return to action Saturday when they host the Nets. Detroit bounced back from Sunday's loss to improve to 5-1 over its last six games. Andre Drummond had another dominant performance with 22 points and 13 rebounds in 31 minutes of action. John Lucas filled in admirably off the bench with 15 points in 22 minutes after rookie Spencer Dinwiddie, the usual backup point guard, went down with a sprained ankle. The Pistons will finish out their back-to-back set Wednesday in Charlotte before another back-to-back starts Friday in Chicago.  											",Detroit,Pistons,Atlanta,Hawks,Little Caesars Arena,56,19,29,45,10.0,26.0,34.0,72.0,12.0,17.0,37.0,23.0,9.0,7.0,24.0,39.0,83.0,7.0,10.0,42.0,23.0,16.0,Caron Butler,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,22,DeMarre Carroll,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,23,Anthony Tolliver,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,40,Paul Millsap,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,23,Andre Drummond,13.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Al Horford,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,16.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,32,Kyle Korver,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,23,Reggie Jackson,4.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,22,Jeff Teague,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,23,Jodie Meeks,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Shelvin Mack,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,24,Spencer Dinwiddie,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Pero Antic,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,16,Shawne Williams,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,7,Thabo Sefolosha,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,24,Joel Anthony,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Kent Bazemore,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,24,Tayshaun Prince,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,25,Mike Muscala,13.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,24

												The Spurs (48-26) defeated the Heat (34-40) 95-81 at the AmericanAirlines Arena on Tuesday.The game was tight until midway through the third quarter, when the Spurs began to pull away. By the end of the third, they'd established an 11-point lead. Shooting percentages were probably the difference-maker, as the Spurs went 50 percent from the field (37-74 FG) and 44 percent from three-point range (8-18), while the Heat hit 41 percent of their shots from the field (32-79) and 33 percent from beyond the arc (5-15). Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs in scoring with 22 points (8-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt), to go with nine rebounds, three assists, four steals and two blocks in 38 minutes. Tony Parker had 16 points (7-12 FG), two rebounds, five assists and one steal in 26 minutes. Tim Duncan contributed 12 points (5-10 FG), 11 rebounds, one assist, one steal and three blocks in 24 minutes. Goran Dragic was Miami's leading scorer with 19 points (6-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt), to go with one rebound and three assists in 39 minutes. Dwayne Wade added 15 points (6-20 FG, 1-3 3Pt), five rebounds and one assist in 34 minutes. Chris Andersen (calf) started Tuesday's game despite sitting out Sunday against the Pistons. He had four points (2-8 FG), 10 rebounds and two steals in 24 minutes. Hassan Whiteside (hand) returned from a three-game absence to spell Andersen at center. He finished with 10 points (5-7 FG), six rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block in 23 minutes. The Spurs are sixth in the Western Conference, three games ahead of the seventh-place Mavericks. Miami is currently the seven seed in the Eastern Conference, only a half-game ahead of the eighth-place Nets. With Tuesday's victory, the Spurs have swept the season series with the Heat, 2-0.

												The Golden State Warriors (61-13) overcame a big deficit to pull out a 110-106 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers (49-26) on Tuesday at the Staples Center. The final regular season meeting between the Clippers and Warriors did not disappoint. After the Clippers opened up a 17 point lead in the second quarter, the Warriors woke up and started chipping away at the deficit. Los Angeles took a six point lead into the fourth, but Golden State's reserves opened the period on a 9-0 run to grab the lead. The Clippers, who had 88 points through three quarters, went cold from the floor in the fourth, hitting just three of their 13 field goal attempts. The Warriors clinched the season series 3-1. Golden State withstood an offensive barrage from Los Angeles to make a run of its own to notch its 61st victory of the season. Klay Thompson had a quiet first half, but started to heat up in the third with 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting from the floor. Thompson finished with 25 points. While the ""Splash Brothers"" combined for 52 points, the Warriors' role players were key in keeping them in the game. Marreese Speights had 13 points in 15 minutes off the bench and David Lee, who started in place of the injured Draymond Green, scored 17. The Warriors will look to extend their winning streak to 11 on Thursday when they host the Suns.  Los Angeles did everything right through the first 36 minutes of this contest, but a fourth quarter collapse cost the Clippers a signature win over their rival. Blake Griffin had a tremendous game with 40 points (16-25 FG) to go with 12 rebounds and three blocks.

												The Boston Celtics (33-41) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (31-42) 116-104 on Monday.Rookie point guard Marcus Smart bounced back after going scoreless against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. He put in 14 points to go along with six boards, four assists three steals and one black. His backcourt mate Avery Bradley led the Celtics with 30 points and eight rebounds in 39 minutes of action. Boston got loads of backcourt production, as Isaiah Thomas came off the bench and had 10 points and seven assists. Thomas has been great since putting up a dud in his first game back from injury four games ago. Over his last three games Thomas is averaging 15.7 points and 6.7 assists in less than 25.0 minutes a game. Their three-headed backcourt has put them in the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference with the Brooklyn Nets hot on their heels. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 28 points and 12 assists in 39 minutes. Charlotte's other star Al Jefferson was able to play despite needing to have his knee drained of fluid two times over the past week. He finished with 12 points, five rebounds and four assists in 25 minutes. Cody Zeller was unable to play again on Monday with a shoulder injury, he's missed nine of the last ten games, including five straight. The Hornets are 3-7 in his absence.Charlotte will welcome the Detroit Pistons to town, as Boston will host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (20-53) beat the Philadelphia 76ers (18-57) 113-111 in overtime on Monday.Jordan Clarkson not only led the Lakers with 26 points and 11 assists, but he also led them to victory with a game winning layup with less than a second remaining in overtime. Wayne Ellington assisted on Clarkson's layup and also scored seven points of his own in the extra period. Jabari Brown came off the bench and scored 22 points to help the Lakers achieve their 20th win of the season. Nerlens Noel had another nice game to help his bid for rookie of the year. He had 19 points, 14 rebounds, four assists, one steal, one block and scored the final six points for Philadelphia. However, it wasn't enough to squeak by the Lakers, as these two teams compile ping pong balls for the NBA Draft Lottery in hopes of a bright future.   The 76ers will play the Washington Wizards on Wednesday, as the Lakers will bring in the New Orleans Pelicans. 											",Philadelphia,76ers,Los Angeles,Lakers,Wells Fargo Center,20,53,18,57,10.0,30.0,39.0,96.0,23.0,38.0,51.0,27.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,Robert Covington,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,13.0,3.0,10.0,5.0,31,Wesley Johnson,11.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,12.0,5.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,43,Nerlens Noel,14.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,36,Ryan Kelly,7.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,16.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,43,Furkan Aldemir,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Tarik Black,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,JaKarr Sampson,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,25,Wayne Ellington,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,15.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,42,Ish Smith,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,20.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,31,Jordan Clarkson,6.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,26.0,9.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,43,Isaiah Canaan,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,18.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,27,Robert Sacre,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Glenn Robinson III,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,25,Jabari Brown,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,33,Hollis Thompson,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Jordan Hill,10.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,21,Thomas Robinson,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Carlos Boozer,,,,,,,,,,,,Henry Sims,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,24,Kobe Bryant,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Atlanta Hawks (56-18) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (36-38) 101-88 on Monday at the Philips Arena. When the Bucks cut the Hawks' lead to five midway through the third quarter, it appeared to be anyone's game. However, after an Atlanta timeout, the Hawks' Kyle Korver made his mark on the game. Korver scored 11 straight points, including three three-pointers, help break the game open. The Hawks are now one game away from tying the single season franchise record for wins. Milwaukee was coming off a 108-95 loss to Golden State at home Saturday and fell again Monday. The Bucks, who are just 1.5 games ahead of the Heat for the sixth seed in the East, have now dropped eight of their last ten. Michael Carter-Williams was able to play after being away from the team to attend the funeral of a family member. Carter-Williams shot just 1-for-6 from the floor and finished with four points, five assists, and four turnovers in 21 minutes. Zaza Pachulia had 17 points and 13 rebounds against his former team. The Bucks will look to bounce back Wednesday against the Bulls in what could be a playoff preview. Atlanta deployed all of its usual starters Monday after resting them against Charlotte one night after clinching the number one seed in the East. Dennis Schroder suffered a left toe injury during Monday's contest and coach Mike Budenholzer said in his post game press conference that the second year guard will not travel with the team to Detroit for Tuesday's game. Schroder has been a great contributor off the bench and in spot start situations this season, so the Hawks will be cautious with him as they already have the top seed secured. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Milwaukee,Bucks,State Farm Arena,36,38,56,18,9.0,27.0,36.0,76.0,20.0,24.0,41.0,25.0,11.0,4.0,17.0,31.0,71.0,15.0,22.0,39.0,25.0,11.0,DeMarre Carroll,8.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,23.0,9.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,34,Giannis Antetokounmpo,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,38,Paul Millsap,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,34,Ersan Ilyasova,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,28,Al Horford,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,18.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,33,Zaza Pachulia,13.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35,Kyle Korver,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,33,Khris Middleton,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,36,Jeff Teague,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,29,Michael Carter-Williams,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,21,Pero Antic,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Jerryd Bayless,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,30,Kent Bazemore,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,15,O.J.

												The Toronto Raptors (44-30) took down the Houston Rockets (50-24) 99-96 on Monday.DeMar DeRozan lit it up with 42 points in 41 minutes on 14-for-27 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds. He did a great job of getting himself to the free throw line, as he went 12-of-17 from the charity stripe. Jonas Valunciunas didn't mind not facing Dwight Howard. He finished with 15 points, nine rebounds and a whopping five blocked shots in 28 minutes in this matchup of playoff teams. Toronto ended March on a two-game win streak after they went 5-8 to begin the month.With Dwight Howard sitting out to rest on the second night of a back-to-back, Joey Dorsey was deployed into the starting lineup. He had seven points and four rebounds in 20 minutes of action. James Harden continued to roll in what has been his best season as an NBA player. He's averaging 27.2 points, 7.0 assists, 5.7 rebounds and 1.9 steals a game in an MVP-caliber season. The Rockets will host the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, as the Raptors will head to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Houston,Rockets,Scotiabank Arena,50,24,44,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Terrence Ross,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,23,Trevor Ariza,8.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,15.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,39,Amir Johnson,16.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,Josh Smith,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,14.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,27,Jonas Valanciunas,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Joey Dorsey,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,DeMar DeRozan,11.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,42.0,14.0,27.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,41,James Harden,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,31.0,9.0,22.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,37,Greivis Vasquez,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,33,Jason Terry,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,25,Patrick Patterson,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,27,Clint Capela,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,Lou Williams,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,26,Pablo Prigioni,2.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,James Johnson,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,19,Corey Brewer,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,31,Tyler Hansbrough,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Nick Johnson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Bruno Caboclo,,,,,,,,,,,,Dwight Howard,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Memphis Grizzlies (51-24) beat the Sacramento Kings (26-47) 97-83 on Monday.The Grizzlies badly needed a slump buster, as they had lost three straight in a tough stretch of their schedule against the Cavaliers, Warriors and Spurs coming into Monday. That's just what they got in the form of the DeMarcus Cousin-less Sacramento Kings. Marc Gasol didn't have a field day scoring the ball as Reggie Evans, who stepped in for Cousins, is a bothersome defender. Instead Gasol was able to find passing lanes that led to baskets as he finished with six assists, leading his team in that category from the center position. Memphis is elated that March is over, as they piled up eight losses, making it their worst month of the season.Former Memphis star Rudy Gay did his best to pick up the slack for Cousins. Gay put up 24 points in 29 minutes but left the game in the third quarter after being elbowed by Gasol. He didn't return as he was suffering from concussion like symptoms. The Kings went into the final period down 11 and with their go-to scorer. They were unable to muster enough points to surpass the Grizzlies and garnered their second straight loss after a four-game win streak. The Houston Rockets will welcome the Kings to town on Wednesday, as Memphis will bring in the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Utah Jazz (33-41) routed the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-58), 104-84, on Monday at the Target Center. Utah took a 10-point lead into the half, but turned this contest into a blowout in the third quarter. The Jazz outscored the short-handed Timberwolves 31-17 in the third and led by as many as 27 in the game. Gordon Hayward led the Jazz with 22 points and Trey Burke added 19 off the bench to help secure the victory. With Monday's win, the Jazz win the season series with the Timberwolves 3-1. Utah finished March with a 10-6 record, holding opponents to under 100 points in all but three of those games. Derrick Favors, who has been having an excellent second half of the season, sat out of this game with back spasms despite being able to participate in Monday's shootaround. Trevor Booker filled in at power forward and had a Favors-like stat line of 17 points and 13 rebounds. Rodney Hood left the contest with concussion-like symptoms and did not return. The Jazz will return to action Wednesday against the Nuggets. Minnesota was once again without several of its regular starters Monday and was outmatched. The Timberwolves were missing Ricky Rubio, Kevin Martin, Gorgui Dieng, and Gary Neal and Nikola Pekovic was ruled out for the rest of the season earlier on Monday. The eight players Minnesota had at its disposal Monday finished with a 36 percent field goal percentage, making just 28-of-76 of their shots from the field. Zach Lavine made another start at point guard and posted 21 points, six assists, and five rebounds. Robbie Hummel had nine points and seven rebounds in his second game back after a broken hand sidelined him for 29 games. The Timberwolves will return to action Wednesday against Toronto.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (48-25) clinched a playoff spot Tuesday with an emphatic 109-86 win over the Phoenix Suns (38-37) at the Moda Center. Portland will be going back to the playoffs after its second win over Phoenix in four days. While Friday's game was a tightly contested and low-scoring contest where Portland nabbed the 87-81 victory, Monday's game was out of hand by the eight minute mark of the third quarter. The Trail Blazers outscored the Suns 37-16 in the third to put the result beyond all doubt. Portland moves one game closer to clinching the Northwest Division while Phoenix's playoff chances may be coming to a close. Phoenix had a crucial four-game home stretch last week, but went 1-3 and stumbled again Monday. The Suns have now lost four games in a row and have a brutal schedule the rest of the way. All but one of Phoenix's final seven opponents are either in the playoffs or in contention for a playoff spot. Brandon Knight missed Monday's game after aggravating his pre-existing ankle injury during Sunday's loss to the Thunder. The Suns are now 4.5 games out of the eighth seed in the West with just seven games to go. Phoenix will return to action Thursday against Golden State. Portland  has now won four straight games after a five-game skid earlier in March raised some concerns about its viability come playoff time. The Trail Blazers had the luxury of resting their starters for the fourth quarter, allowing seven of its eight reserves to log double-digit minutes. The Trail Blazers have a huge matchup with playoff implications on the horizon with a game against the Clippers on Wednesday. Portland needs to win to even the season series with Los Angeles at two games apiece. 											",Portland,Trail Blazers,Phoenix,Suns,Moda Center,38,37,48,25,12.0,26.0,41.0,78.0,9.0,10.0,41.0,26.0,12.0,3.0,13.0,38.0,80.0,7.0,10.0,33.0,18.0,12.0,Nicolas Batum,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,27,Marcus Morris Sr.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,22,LaMarcus Aldridge,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,29,Markieff Morris,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,28,Robin Lopez,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Alex Len,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Arron Afflalo,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,25,P.J.

												The Houston Rockets (50-23) defeated the Washington Wizards (41-32), 99-91, on Sunday at the Verizon Center. Sunday's earliest game got off to a sluggish start, especially for the Wizards. For much of the game, Washington's John Wall appeared to be the only Wizard that was playing at full speed. Houston started to let its lead slip away during the fourth quarter when Washington's Otto Porter canned a three to cut it to four. The Rockets answered with consecutive three pointers to extend the lead back to double digits. Every time the Wizards would start to embark on a comeback, the Rockets had an answer. The ""Hack a Howard"" strategy backfired for the Wizards as Dwight Howard hit five of his eight free throw attempts. Bradley Beal had a chance to cut Houston's lead to three late in the game, but had his shot rejected by James Harden, which all but sealed it for Houston.Houston has now won four in a row, three of which have come on the road. The Rockets are the third-best road team in the league, behind only the Hawks and Warriors with a 23-13 mark away from the Toyota Center. Sunday's win temporarily puts Houston in a tie with Memphis for the second sweed in the West. The Grizzlies could fall behind the Rockets if they are unable to notch a victory in San Antonio later in the day Sunday. James Harden led the team in scoring with 24 points on 7-of-20 shooting. The Rockets will play the second part of a back-to-back set Monday at the Raptors. Washington snapped its four-game losing streak Friday with an overtime win against Charlotte, but was unable to notch its second straight win Sunday. John Wall barely missed out on a triple-double, finishing with 25 points, 12 assists, and eight rebounds. The Wizards are looking more and more cemented in the fifth spot in the East as they now trail the Raptors by two games. Washington is off until Wednesday when it hosts Philadelphia. 											",Washington,Wizards,Houston,Rockets,Capital One Arena,50,23,41,33,2.0,13.0,25.0,68.0,24.0,30.0,37.0,17.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,Paul Pierce,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,22,Trevor Ariza,8.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,37,Nene,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Josh Smith,10.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,36,Marcin Gortat,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Dwight Howard,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Bradley Beal,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,37,James Harden,3.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,24.0,7.0,20.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,37,John Wall,8.0,12.0,4.0,1.0,25.0,7.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,42,Jason Terry,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,19,Martell Webster,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8,Joey Dorsey,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Drew Gooden,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Corey Brewer,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,7.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,22,Rasual Butler,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,13,Pablo Prigioni,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,28,Ramon Sessions,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,Nick Johnson,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,16,Kevin Seraphin,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,Clint Capela,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Brooklyn Nets (32-40) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (19-53), 107-99, on Sunday at the Barclays Center. Brooklyn had a comfortable lead for much of the game until Los Angeles made its move in the fourth, cutting the deficit to four with a minute to go. However, Brook Lopez answered with two free throws to put the Nets up six. Lopez finished with 30 points and 11 rebounds, his second 30 point outing in his last three games. Lopez has been key to Brooklyn's playoff hopes, averaging 20.9 points and 9.1 rebounds over his last ten games while shooting 58 percent from the floor. The Nets are now percentage points behind the Celtics for the eighth seed in the East, but the Celtics won the season series 3-1 over the Nets. Los Angeles has now dropped seven of its last nine games, with the two wins coming over Philadelphia and Minnesota. Jeremy Lin was sidelined for this game with an upper respiratory infection, which allowed Wayne Ellington to move back into the starting lineup. Ellington had 13 points and five rebounds over 30 minutes on the floor. Jordan Hill returned to action for this game and had a huge outing off the bench with 22 points and 26 rebounds. The Lakers will finish out their five game road trip Monday when they take on the 76ers. Brooklyn is continuing to make a playoff push in the crowded Eastern Conference playoff picture. The Nets have won seven of their last nine, but have a tough schedule the rest of the way. Every team they play outside of the Knicks and Magic are either firmly in the playoffs or competing for a spot. Deron Williams (illness) was able to take the floor Sunday and posted 13 points and nine assists over 34 minutes. The Nets will return to action Tuesday against the Pacers. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Los Angeles,Lakers,Barclays Center,19,53,32,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Joe Johnson,8.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,35,Wesley Johnson,5.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,35,Mason Plumlee,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Ryan Kelly,2.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,35,Brook Lopez,11.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,30.0,13.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40,Tarik Black,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Markel Brown,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,36,Jordan Clarkson,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,35,Deron Williams,1.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,33,Wayne Ellington,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,29,Earl Clark,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,19,Jabari Brown,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,30,Alan Anderson,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,28,Robert Sacre,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Jarrett Jack,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,14,Jordan Hill,16.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,10.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Bojan Bogdanovic,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,Carlos Boozer,,,,,,,,,,,,Cory Jefferson,,,,,,,,,,,,Kobe Bryant,,,,,,,,,,,

												The New Orleans Pelicans (39-34) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-57), 110-88,  on Sunday at the Smoothie King Center. New Orleans needed to take advantage of Sunday's favorable matchup in order to keep its playoff hopes alive, and that's exactly what it did. The short-handed Timberwolves simply didn't have enough talent available to hang with the Pelicans. Anthony Davis turned in another strong outing with 28 points, nine rebounds, and five assists over 37 minutes. The Pelicans are now two games behind the Thunder for the final playoff spot in the West. Minnesota was already missing Kevin Martin, Kevin Garnett, Nikola Pekovic, and Ricky Rubio for this game, and things got worse when Gorgui Dieng had to leave the game with a facial contusion. Dieng was held scoreless in nine minutes before exiting the contest. Robbie Hummel returned from a 29-game absence due to a broken hand and finished with six points in 18 minutes off the bench. The Timberwolves will look to end their three game losing streak Monday when they host the Jazz. New Orleans took care of business Sunday, but a tough stretch awaits it starting Saturday. The Pelicans will start a three game road trip Wednesday against the Lakers and will then take on the Kings on Friday. From there, the Pelicans play the Trail Blazers, Warriors, Grizzlies, and Suns in a crucial stretch. Sunday's game was a solid all-around effort by the Pelicans, who shot 57 percent from the floor and will look to continue that sort of efficiency Wednesday against the Lakers. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Smoothie King Center,16,57,39,34,6.0,13.0,43.0,75.0,18.0,24.0,35.0,29.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,Quincy Pondexter,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,20,Andrew Wiggins,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,38,Anthony Davis,9.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,28.0,10.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37,Adreian Payne,11.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,35,Omer Asik,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Gorgui Dieng,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Eric Gordon,3.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,30,Zach LaVine,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,37,Tyreke Evans,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,22,Lorenzo Brown,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,36,Dante Cunningham,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Chase Budinger,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,30,Norris Cole,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,26,Justin Hamilton,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,23,Alexis Ajinca,8.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Robbie Hummel,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Toney Douglas,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,16,Anthony Bennett,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,11,Luke Babbitt,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7,Kevin Garnett,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (48-27) survived a scare from the Philadelphia 76ers (18-56) as they edged them out by a score of 87-86 at the Quicken Loans Arena. The 76ers gave the Cavaliers everything they could handle Sunday, but fell just short of pulling off the upset as Nerlens Noel missed the potential go-ahead jumper with two seconds remaining. The Cavaliers narrowly avoided their second straight loss despite being held to just 38.8% shooting from the field. The 76ers missed too many free throws down the stretch, finishing just 8-for-15 from the stripe in a one point loss. Philadelphia could have taken the season series from Cleveland had it won Sunday's contest. Philadelphia put forth a valiant effort Sunday against the East's second seed on Sunday, but poor free throw shooting prevented the upset. Robert Covington bounced back from a disappointing two point outing Friday to score 19 against the Cavaliers. Furkan Aldemir got the start at center and responded with 11 points and 10 rebounds over 27 minutes. The 76ers will finish out their back-to-back set on Monday when they host the Lakers. Cleveland had its full complement of players on the floor to start the game, but it didn't end that way. Iman Shumpert left the game with an ankle injury and Kevin Love had an early exit due to a lower back injury. LeBron James had 20 points, but it came on 8-of-24 shooting from the floor and 3-of-6 shooting from the line. The Cavaliers will be idle Monday before hosting the Heat on Tuesday. 											",Cleveland,Cavaliers,Philadelphia,76ers,Quicken Loans Arena,18,56,48,27,9.0,23.0,33.0,85.0,12.0,18.0,53.0,17.0,17.0,10.0,30.0,34.0,84.0,8.0,15.0,45.0,18.0,13.0,LeBron James,11.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,8.0,24.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,37,Jerami Grant,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,21,Kevin Love,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,30,Nerlens Noel,11.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Timofey Mozgov,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,32,Furkan Aldemir,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,26,JR Smith,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,37,Robert Covington,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,31,Kyrie Irving,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,18.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,38,Ish Smith,5.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,16.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,30,Iman Shumpert,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,10,Luc Mbah a Moute,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,25,Tristan Thompson,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,JaKarr Sampson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Matthew Dellavedova,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,20,Hollis Thompson,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23,James Jones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5,Isaiah Canaan,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,17,Shawn Marion,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6,Henry Sims,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12

												The Clippers (49-25) defeated the Celtics (32-41) 119-106 at TD Garden on Sunday. The Clippers’ J.J. Redick scored the first points of the game, knocking down a three-point jumper on Los Angeles’ first possession. That was the story all night long, as Redick finished with a team-high 27 points, going 5-for-6 from beyond the arc in 33 minutes. The Clippers never gave up the lead. At halftime they led by 21 points, and, going into the fourth quarter, they were up 105-79. The Clippers shot 48.8 percent from three-point range, while the Celtics shot 25.8 percent. The Clippers went to the line almost twice as much as the Celtics, attempting 40 free throws compared to Boston’s 23. And the Clippers pulled down 13 more boards than the Celtics over the course of the game.The Clippers’ Blake Griffin and Chris Paul each had 21 points. Paul went 3-for-4 from three-point land and contributed three rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and one block in 35 minutes. DeAndre Jordan had 15 points (6-8 FG), 14 rebounds and one steal in 29 minutes.The Celtics’ Isaiah Thomas came off the bench to lead the team in scoring with 19 points. Thomas went 4-for-12 from the field and 2-for-7 from three-point range in 26 minutes of play. Thomas (back) only scored four points against the Heat on Wednesday after an eight-game absence. However, it appears he’s shaken off the rust, scoring a combined 37 points off the bench in his last two games. Tyler Zeller had 16 points (7-12 FG) and five rebounds in 21 minutes. Kelly Olynyk had 14 points (6-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt), five rebounds, two assists and one steal in 22 minutes.The Clippers are fifth in the Western Conference and have clinched a playoff birth. Boston has lost five of its last seven and is currently ninth in the Eastern Conference. However, they’re only a half-game behind the eighth-place Nets.The Clippers have finished the season 3-1 against the Celtics.

												The Miami Heat (34-39) defeated the Detroit Pistons (28-45), 109-102, on Sunday at the AmericanAirlines Arena. Dwayne Wade, who had fluid drained from his knee Saturday, battled through the pain to play Sunday. He carried the Heat with 40 points on 14-of-27 shooting as they were able to hold on for the win. Miami managed to out-rebound Detroit despite Hassan Whiteside's absence, but the Pistons did score 56 of their 102 points in the paint. The Pistons went on a furious run at the end to cut the Heat's lead by scoring 12 points in the final minute, but it was too little too late. These teams will meet for the final time this season on Saturday. Detroit's four-game winning streak came to an end Sunday, but it put up a valiant effort on the road against a playoff team. Andre Drummond had a big game with 32 points and 14 rebounds and Reggie Jackson poured in 31 to go with nine assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was cold from the floor, missing all six of his three point attempts and finishing with nine points on 4-of-15 shooting over 41 minutes. The Pistons will return to action Tuesday when they host the Hawks. Miami was able to move one step closer to locking down a playoff spot Sunday despite a rash of injuries. Not only was Hassan Whiteside sidelined with a hand injury, Michael Beasley and Luol Deng both had to exit the game with elbow and knee injuries respectively. Udonis Haslem had a big outing with 18 points and 13 rebounds over 35 minutes. The Heat will host the Spurs on Tuesday in a rematch of last year's NBA Finals. 											",Miami,Heat,Detroit,Pistons,AmericanAirlines Arena,28,45,34,39,,,,,,,,,,8.0,25.0,40.0,83.0,14.0,22.0,37.0,24.0,11.0,Luol Deng,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Caron Butler,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Henry Walker,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,34,Anthony Tolliver,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,27,Udonis Haslem,13.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,35,Andre Drummond,14.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,32.0,14.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,39,Dwyane Wade,6.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,40.0,14.0,27.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,35,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,15.0,0.0,6.0,4.0,40,Goran Dragic,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,34,Reggie Jackson,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,31.0,12.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,36,Mario Chalmers,9.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,30,Tayshaun Prince,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,23,James Ennis III,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,24,Joel Anthony,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Tyler Johnson,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Jodie Meeks,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,27,Michael Beasley,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Spencer Dinwiddie,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,11,Chris Andersen,,,,,,,,,,,,Shawne Williams,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7

												The San Antonio Spurs (47-26) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (50-24) 103-89 Sunday at the AT&T Center in a clash of two of the best teams in the Western ConferenceSan Antonio had the lead for the entirety of Sunday's game, but Memphis hung close until the fourth quarter. Kawhi Leonard scored the Spurs' first 15 points of the fourth to help break the game open. Leonard finished with a game-high 25 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes of action. While the Spurs are peaking at the right time of the season, the Grizzlies' recent struggles are starting to become a concern. The Grizzlies have dropped three straight to top-level competition by an average margin of 19.7 points. Houston has now overtaken Memphis for the second seed in the West.Memphis's fourth quarter implosion led to its third loss in a row. The Grizzlies have only had one other stretch with more consecutive losses, which was a four game skid back in December. Zach Randolph broke out his mini-slump Sunday, however, with 20 points and 13 boards in 33 minutes. The Grizzlies will look to bounce back Monday when they host the Kings. San Antonio is looking more and more like its championship team from a year ago. Sunday was another all-around effort from the Spurs, who had a plus-14 rebounding margin and shot 50 percent from the floor as a team. Tony Parker had 17 points and six assists and Tiago Splitter was solid again with 15 points and eight rebounds. The Spurs will return to action Tuesday when they take on the Heat in Miami in a rematch of the last two finals. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Memphis,Grizzlies,AT&T Center,50,24,47,26,4.0,17.0,42.0,83.0,15.0,18.0,47.0,25.0,8.0,6.0,14.0,36.0,82.0,11.0,12.0,34.0,22.0,10.0,Kawhi Leonard,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,11.0,17.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,33,Vince Carter,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,22,Tim Duncan,5.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Zach Randolph,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Tiago Splitter,8.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Marc Gasol,6.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,33,Danny Green,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,29,Courtney Lee,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,35,Tony Parker,1.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,34,Mike Conley,1.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,35,Manu Ginobili,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,Jeff Green,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,15.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,31,Boris Diaw,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,22,Nick Calathes,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Aron Baynes,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Kosta Koufos,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Patty Mills,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,12,Beno Udrih,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19,Marco Belinelli,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,13,Jordan Adams,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

												The Pacers (31-41) edged out the Mavericks (45-28) 104-99 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday. It was a tight contest from start to finish. After three quarters of play, the Mavericks had a one-point lead. With around five minutes remaining, the Pacers’ George Hill hit two successive three-pointers that gave Indiana a six-point lead and probably decided the game. The Pacers’ C.J. Miles was a sharpshooter Sunday night. He had 28 points, going 9-for-12 from the field and 5-for-6 from three-point range. Miles has been hot lately, putting up 26 points on Thursday against the Bucks. Hill finished with 14 points (6-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt), four rebounds, five assists and one block in 36 minutes. Roy Hibbert had 14 points (5-10 FG), seven rebounds, two assists and one block in 25 minutes.Chandler Parsons led the Mavericks in scoring with 27 points (11-20 FG, 2-4 3Pt), to go with 10 rebounds, one assist and one block in 37 minutes. Dirk Nowitzki had 19 points (7-13, 1-1 3Pt) and five rebounds in 34 minutes. Rajon Rondo contributed 17 points (8-14 FG), seven rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and one block in 38 minutes.Coming down to the wire, the Mavericks are seventh in the Western Conference, 4.5 games ahead of eighth place Oklahoma City. The Pacers are tied with the Celtics for ninth in the Eastern Conference. They’re only a half-game behind the eighth place Nets, so Sunday’s victory was crucial. With Sunday’s game in the books, the Pacers have completed the season series sweep of the Mavericks, 2-0. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Dallas,Mavericks,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,45,29,32,41,10.0,17.0,37.0,73.0,18.0,26.0,40.0,23.0,14.0,6.0,15.0,40.0,90.0,13.0,19.0,41.0,20.0,12.0,Solomon Hill,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,14,Chandler Parsons,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,27.0,11.0,20.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,36,David West,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,28,Dirk Nowitzki,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,33,Roy Hibbert,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Tyson Chandler,11.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,CJ Miles,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,9.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,28,Richard Jefferson,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,George Hill,4.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,36,Rajon Rondo,7.0,10.0,2.0,1.0,17.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,37,Rodney Stuckey,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,30,Amar'e Stoudemire,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,Ian Mahinmi,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Al-Farouq Aminu,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14,C.J.

												The Thunder (42-32) defeated the Suns (38-36) 109-97 at the US Airways Center on Sunday.Phoenix jumped out to a 35-24 lead by the end of the first quarter and, at one point, led by 19 points in the second. But, midway through the second quarter, the Thunder climbed back into the game, cutting the lead to eight points by halftime. By the end of the third quarter, Phoenix’ lead was down to three points. With 9 minutes remaining, Oklahoma City took the lead and began to pull away, outscoring the Suns 33-18 in the fourth quarter. Three-point shooting may have been the difference-maker, as the Suns went 5-for-22 from beyond the arc, while the Thunder went 10-for-25. Russell Westbrook shined as he has for most of the season in Kevin Durant’s absence, finishing with 33 points (10-29 FG, 1-7 3Pt), nine rebounds, seven assists, three steals and one block in 38 minutes. D.J. Augustin came off the bench to score 19 points (6-9 FG, 4-5 3Pt), to go with one rebound, three assists and one steal in 32 minutes. Dion Waiters contributed 18 points (8-20 FG, 1-6 3Pt), three rebounds and one assist in 38 minutes.Markieff Morris led the Suns in scoring with 24 points (10-20 FG, 1-2 3Pt), to go with seven rebounds, one assist and one steal. T.J. Warren scored 18 points off the bench, going 8-for-10 from the field.Sunday’s loss was critical for the Suns, who are now four games behind the eighth-place Thunder in the Western Conference. To make matters worse, the Thunder have the heads-up tie-breaker, which realistically puts the Suns five games behind Oklahoma City. The Thunder have won the season series 3-1.

												The Charlotte Hornets (31-41) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (55-18), 115-100, on Saturday at the Time Warner Cable Arena. Charlotte drew a matchup with the East's top team at the right time, with Atlanta resting four starters and Jeff Teague sitting out with a sprained ankle. The Hawks' reserves-turned-starters fared well against the Hornets, but the Hornets' lineup proved to be too much in the end. The Hawks cut the lead to single-digits in the fourth, but the Hornets, led by Mo Williams' shooting, put them away. Williams finished with 18 points off the bench and made four of his five attempts from beyond the arc. The Hornets lead the season series 2-1 and they will meet one last time during the regular season on April 10. Atlanta was coming off a 99-86 victory over Miami on Friday to clinch the top seed in the Eastern Conference. As a result, coach Mike Budenholzer didn't feel pressed to deploy his starters for the second game of a back-to-back set. Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Kyle Korver, and DeMarre Carroll were all rested for this game and Dennis Schroder started in place of Jeff Teague. The Hawks started Elton Brand, Mike Muscala, John Jenkins, and Kent Bazemore alongside Schroder. They showed good chemistry throughout the game with 32 assists on 37 field goals. Bazemore had a season-high 20 points and Muscala posted a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Hawks will return to action Monday against the Bucks. Charlotte wasn't necessarily at full strength Saturday, but was able to get an important win as it continues to make a push for a post season spot. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (ankle) and Cody Zeller (shoulder) both missed this game, opening the opportunity for Jeff Taylor and Marvin Williams to move into the starting lineup. Al Jefferson had just two points in 17 minutes on the floor. The Hornets are now just a game out of the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference and will have a chance at another big win on Monday when they host the Celtics. 											",Charlotte,Hornets,Atlanta,Hawks,Spectrum Center,55,18,31,41,12.0,26.0,42.0,80.0,19.0,22.0,42.0,27.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,Jeffery Taylor,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,27,Kent Bazemore,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,14.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,33,Marvin Williams,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,14.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,36,Mike Muscala,10.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,18.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,34,Al Jefferson,6.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Elton Brand,6.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Gerald Henderson,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,10.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,29,John Jenkins,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,33,Kemba Walker,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,19.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,34,Dennis Schroder,4.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,25,Bismack Biyombo,11.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Shelvin Mack,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,25,PJ Hairston,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,19,Pero Antic,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20,Lance Stephenson,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7,Thabo Sefolosha,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,22,Mo Williams,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,22,Austin Daye,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,16,Jason Maxiell,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,DeMarre Carroll,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Chicago Bulls (45-29) scored more points before the fourth quarter than the New York Knicks (14-60) tallied the entire game, winning 111-80. The Knicks failed to score 20 points in any of the first three quarters, falling behind 84-53 heading into the final period.Potential Rookie of the Year Nikola Mirotic scored a game-high 24 points off the bench, supplemented by six rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block and three three-pointers in 26 minutes. Pau Gasol notched his league-leading 48th double with 19 points and 12 rebounds in a team-high 28 minutes, throwing his name into the Comeback Player of the Year conversation. Jimmy Butler secured five steals to match his total post-All-Star break. The win moved the Bulls one and half games ahead of the four seed Toronto Raptors with eight games remaining.The Knicks broke a record by losing their 60th game, most losses in a single season of the franchise’s 69-year history. It’s the ninth time in 16 March games the Knicks failed to shoot 40 percent from the field. They've lost seven games in a row and hold a three-game edge over the Minnesota Timberwolves for worst record in the league. Andrea Bargnani scored a team-high 14 points. Langston Galloway played a team-high 36 minutes and shot 5-of-14 from the floor, possessing a team-low negative 28 plus/minus. Ricky Ledo may have played his final game with the Knicks as his 10-day contract expires Sunday. He joined Bargnani and Galloway as the only Knicks to score at least 10 points, contributing 11 points, three rebounds, two steals, one assist and one three-pointer in 29 minutes. The Bulls have three days off before facing the Milwaukee Bucks. The Knicks face a similar layover, hosting the Brooklyn Nets the first day of April.

												The Golden State Warriors (60-13) notched their 60th win of the season Saturday with a 108-95 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks (36-37) at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. With Saturday's victory, Golden State set a franchise record with 60 wins on the season. Steph Curry continued to make his case for MVP with a 25 point outing in which he hit six three-pointers. The Bucks took a 16-14 lead in the first, but that would be their last lead of the game as the Warriors eventually pulled away. Golden State swept the season series against Milwaukee 2-0. The Warriors have now won nine in a row. Eight of those nine wins have been by double digits with the lone single digit victory coming against the Lakers. The Warriors have topped 100 points in 11 straight contests as well. Golden State clinched the Western Conference with the victory and will have home court advantage through the playoffs. The Warriors will return to action Tuesday against the Clippers. Milwaukee simply didn't have the offensive fire power to match Golden State on Saturday. The Bucks shot just 37.9% from the floor as a team and committed 15 turnovers. Khris Middleton led the team in scoring with 14 points on 5-of-14 shooting. The Bucks have a matchup with the Hawks on the docket for Monday. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Golden State,Warriors,Fiserv Forum,60,13,36,37,2.0,15.0,31.0,83.0,26.0,30.0,40.0,20.0,14.0,12.0,25.0,41.0,80.0,12.0,14.0,41.0,25.0,20.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Harrison Barnes,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,26,Ersan Ilyasova,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,10.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,23,David Lee,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Zaza Pachulia,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Andrew Bogut,6.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Khris Middleton,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,27,Klay Thompson,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,21.0,8.0,17.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,34,Michael Carter-Williams,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,21,Stephen Curry,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,8.0,13.0,6.0,9.0,6.0,30,Jerryd Bayless,6.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,26,Brandon Rush,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,John Henson,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Justin Holiday,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,8,O.J.

												The Utah Jazz (32-41) staved off a late rally to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder (41-32), 94-89, in Enes Kanter’s return to Salt Lake City. Derrick Favors was unable to play after injuring his back the night before. Treatment prior to the game did not alleviate the problem.Rodney Hood returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous two games with a stomach flu.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (48-25) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18-55) 119-98 on Friday.The Clippers were led by DeAndre Jordan, who put up another stellar performance, he finished with 17 points, 20 rebounds and two blocks. He's been the leading rebounder in every Los Angeles game dating back to Feb. 21. His play has helped lead them to six straight victories, three of which were on the road. Austin Rivers has seen an increase in minutes recently, most likely because the Clippers have been on the winning end of a couple blowouts, but it never hurts to be the coach's son. He played 24 minutes against Philadelphia and scored 13 points to go along with five rebounds and three assists.Nerlens Noel continued his streak of improved play as of late. He went for 30 points and 14 rebounds against a tough Clipper's interior defense. Over his past five games he's averaging 18.0 points, 12.0 rebounds, 3.0 blocks and 2.2 steals. Much better than his season averages of 9.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.0 blocks and 1.8 steals. Ish Smith seems to have found a home in the Philly starting lineup, for the time being. He had 18 point and 9 assists against Los Angeles. The Sixers will look to tie their season high for wins in a month when they take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, but are much more likely to take a victory against the Lakers on Monday. Doc Rivers will bring his team to Boston to take on his former team the Celtics on Sunday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (31-40) took down the Cleveland Cavaliers (47-27) 106-98 on Friday.The Nets were able to defeat the second best team in the Eastern Conference with strong performances from Brook Lopez and Joe Johnson, who each scored 20 points. Bojan Bogdanovic added a nice spark off the bench with 18 points to help relieve the starters. He wasn't the only one filling it up for the Brooklyn bench, Alan Anderson and Jarrett Jack combined for 29 points, nine rebounds, six assists and three steals. Brooklyn kept their playoff hopes alive and are just a half a game back from the Boston Celtics, who currently hold the eighth and final playoff spot in the East.The Cavaliers ended a four game win streak that began with a victory over the same Nets who beat them on Friday. The big three of LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving combined for 68 points but were the only Cleveland players to reach double figures in any statistical category. The Nets were without Thaddeus Young, but like most teams as of late, the Cavs didn't have an answer for Brook Lopez. It didn't help that bigman Timofey Mozgov was held to just two points and five rebounds with zero fouls in 17 minutes.Cleveland will host Nerlens Noel and the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday, as the Nets will welcome the Los Angeles Lakers to town. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Cleveland,Cavaliers,Barclays Center,47,27,31,40,9.0,23.0,40.0,86.0,17.0,19.0,46.0,21.0,15.0,8.0,30.0,37.0,81.0,16.0,20.0,40.0,17.0,16.0,Joe Johnson,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,14.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,38,LeBron James,5.0,9.0,5.0,1.0,24.0,8.0,15.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,38,Mason Plumlee,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Kevin Love,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,31,Brook Lopez,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,37,Timofey Mozgov,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,16,Markel Brown,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,15,JR Smith,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,10.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,37,Deron Williams,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,22,Kyrie Irving,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,26.0,10.0,22.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,38,Bojan Bogdanovic,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,32,Kendrick Perkins,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5,Alan Anderson,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,30,Iman Shumpert,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,30,Cory Jefferson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Tristan Thompson,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Jarrett Jack,4.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Matthew Dellavedova,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9,Earl Clark,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,11,James Jones,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,10

												The Boston Celtics (32-40) beat the New York Knicks (14-59) 96-92 on Friday.Mini-Manimal Jae Crowder was at it again on Friday. He came off the bench and scored 17 points to go along with nine rebounds in 29 minutes of ferocious energy. He's averaged 15.0 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals over his past five games. Crowder has also been doing a nice job of attacking the basket and getting to the free throw line. Over his last two games he's got to the charity stripe 19 times and sank 15 of those attempts. His improved play has been a key cog in the Celtics establishing themselves as a playoff contender. It also didn't hurt to have Isaiah Thomas back and looking like his old self again. Thomas had 18 points and six assists in just his second game back from injury. He had an under whelming performance in his return to the lineup on Wednesday against Miami, scoring just four points on seven shots in 20 minutes.The 12 million dollar man Andrea Bargnani had a nice overall game against the Celtics. He finished with 25 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks. The 25 points tied a season high, the third time he's done that this season. He almost led the Knicks to their first victory since they inexplicably beat the San Antonio Spurs back on Mar. 17, they've lost six straight since that game.The Chicago Bulls will host the Knicks on Saturday. The Celtics next tilt is against former coach Doc Rivers and the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday.

												The Toronto Raptors (43-30) clinched the Atlantic Division for the second straight season with a 94-83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers (19-52). The Lakers scored 35 second half points in coach Byron Scott’s return after missing two games for personal matters.Kyle Lowry was held out for the fourth time in five games with lingering back issues. DeMar DeRozan led the Raptors with seven assists and 10 rebounds, but he only scored six points on 1-of-10 shooting. Jonas Valanciunas scored a team-high 19 points in 27 minutes, and rookie Bruno Caboclo played for the second time since February 4th. Lou Williams contributed 18 points off the bench as he keeps his Sixth Man of the Year hopes alive.

Curry put up 38 point and 10 assists, as Thompson poured in 28 points of his own to help their team take down the second best team in the Western Conference. Andrew Bogut played a big role in slowing down Marc Gasol, who's having his best season as a pro. The Warriors have a white-knuckle grip on the top seed in the and also own the best record in all of the NBA this season. They combine good chemistry with the ability to play multiple styles of offence to back up their spectacular defense. They stand a chance at ending the regular season with one of the best team records of all-time.Memphis was unable to successfully defend their homecourt against the Warriors on Friday. Most teams have been unable to do that this year but few would've expected the laugher that ensued when these two teams matched up. Jeff Green was probably the top performer for the Griz, he finished with 16 points and eight boards to go along with a negative 16 in the plus/minus statistic. Marc Gasol had one of his worst games of the year posting 13 points, five rebounds, four turnovers and a mind boggling negative 27 in the plus/minus.The Grizzlies will look to forget this game as they will take on the Spurs in San Antonio on Sunday. The Warriors will try and continue their spectacular play when they take on the Bucks in Milwaukee on Saturday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (38-34) kept their playoff hopes alive with a 102-88 win over the Sacramento Kings (26-46). They’re three games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth spot in the Western Conference. Conventional wisdom says Anthony Davis has to make the playoffs in order to become an MVP candidate. He did his best against the Kings, tallying 24 points, nine rebounds, six blocks, two assists, and one steal in 41 minutes. It’s the seventh time he’s registered at least 24 points, nine boards, and six blocks in a game this season; no other players has even done it once. Former King Tyreke Evans added team-highs of 25 points and 10 assists in 33 minutes. Omer Asik corralled 12 rebounds but only attempted two shots in 36 minutes. Eric Gordon was limited to 20 minutes and four points, failing to grab a rebound or hit a three-pointer for the second consecutive game. DeMarcus Cousins picked up his 12th technical foul. He also accounted for 44 percent of the Kings points and 54 percent of their rebounds, accumulating 39 points, 20 rebounds, three blocks, two assists, and one steal in 41 minutes. It’s his 44th double-double this season, second only to Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls. Sophomores Ray McCallum and Ben McLemore combined for nine points on 3-of-13 shooting in 64 minutes. Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi joined Cousins as the only other players to reach double-digit scoring, providing 18 and 10 respectively. The Pelicans conclude a three-game homestand Sunday against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Kings play their third straight road game then they face the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (46-26) beat the Dallas Mavericks (45-28) 94-76 on Friday.The Spurs won the first and fourth quarters by 10 points each, and the held the Mavs to limited productivity in between. Boris Diaw was the man for San Antonio in the game, he went 3-for-4 on three pointers for a game-high 19 points. San Antonio is 10-3 in March and seems to be playing their best basketball of the season when it matters most. Well you won't read this statement too often but Tyson Chandler led the Mavericks in points. Believe it or not it's true, he and Monta Ellis put in 10 points a piece, but it wasn't nearly enough to take down the defending champs on their home floor. It never helps when you only shoot 22 percent from beyond the arc.The Mavericks will look to bounce back on Sunday when they take on the Indiana Pacers, as the Spurs will host the Memphis Grizzlies who were annihilated by the Golden State Warriors on Friday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (46-25) defeated the Phoenix Suns (38-35) 87-81 on Friday.LaMarcus Aldridge was able to give it a go on Friday despite a finger injury that's been bothering him for much of the season. His production was uncompromised as he was able to pour in 27 points to go along with nine boards, one assist and one block. The other fist of the one-two punch that makes up the Blazers attack is Damian Lillard. He didn't play his best basketball putting up 11 points, four rebounds and four assists. It helped to have French swingman Nicolas Batum back in the fold after missing some time with a back injury. Batum recorded five points, nine rebounds and five assists in 32 minutes in his return.The Suns were once again without Brandon Knight who sat out his seventh straight game with an ankle injury. The Suns were 5-2 without Knight until Friday's tilt with the Trail Blazers. Marcus Morris got the start in Knight's place and recorded 15 points and nine rebounds. His twin brother Markieff had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe had an illness that jeopardized his playing status but he was able to suit up and play. He finished with 13 points and seven assists in 38 minutes of action.The Suns will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, as the Trail Blazers will welcome the Denver Nuggets to Portland on Saturday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (36-36) held off the Indiana Pacers (31-41) ,111-107, on Thursday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. The only NBA game Thursday turned out to be a good one as it came down to the final possession. The Bucks led by as many as 23 points early in the game as they finished the first quarter up 34-15. Indiana methodically got itself back into the game, cutting into the lead and getting stops. The Pacers were within three points with the ball in the final seconds, but George Hill couldn't connect from three as the Bucks won their second straight close game. The Bucks and Pacers split the season series at two games apiece.Indiana snapped its losing skid on Wednesday against Washington, but couldn't quite complete the comeback Thursday against Milwaukee. Luis Scola moved into the starting lineup at power forward for David West, who was a late scratch with an allergic reaction. Scola finished with 15 points and nine rebounds over 29 minutes. The Pacers were also without Rodney Stuckey for Thursday's tilt as the prolific bench scorer continues to heal from a calf injury. C.J Watson provided the scoring off the bench with 23 points, making 13 of his 15 free throw attempts. The Pacers will be off until Sunday when they host the Mavericks.Milwaukee was coming off a thrilling 89-88 win over Miami on Tuesday and Thursday's game went down to the wire once again. The Bucks needed to hold off the Pacers late in order to avoid their seventh loss in eight games. Ersan Ilyasova had another big game with 34 points on 12-of-14 shooting to go with six rebounds. O.J Mayo and Jared Dudley both managed to play over 10 minutes off the bench despite nagging injuries. The Bucks have a tough stretch ahead, starting with the Warriors coming to town on Saturday. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Indiana,Pacers,Fiserv Forum,31,41,36,36,9.0,19.0,39.0,73.0,24.0,34.0,30.0,26.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,Giannis Antetokounmpo,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,43,Solomon Hill,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,22,Ersan Ilyasova,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,34.0,12.0,14.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,35,Luis Scola,8.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,29,Zaza Pachulia,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,Roy Hibbert,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Khris Middleton,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,33,CJ Miles,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,26.0,7.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,32,Michael Carter-Williams,5.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,13.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,29,George Hill,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,12.0,6.0,10.0,5.0,33,O.J.

												The Brooklyn Nets (30-40) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (30-40) 91-88 on Wednesday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.With the win, the Nets pulled their season record even with the Hornets, but both still sit on the outside looking in for the Eastern Conference playoff race. They're not far out though, as both are just a game behind the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed, as well as two games back from the Miami Heat for seventh. With 12 games left in their schedules, each should have the opportunity to make a run during the last few weeks of the regular season to make thier case for a playoff bid.The Nets can credit this win to Brook Lopez, who posted a game-high of 34 points (16-26 FG, 2-2 FT), while also adding 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. He's been on an absolute tear of late, scoring 30 points or more in three of his last four games, while averaging 24.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.3 blocks during that stretch. Lopez got some help from Deron Williams as well, who recorded a double-double of his own with 10 points (2-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-5 FT), seven rebounds and 14 assists. He's struggled with his shot recently, combining to go just 4-for-15 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line over his last two games, but he continues to find his teammates at a high rate with 24 assists over those last two as well. Alan Anderson chipped in with a solid contribution off the bench, recording 13 points (6-10 FG, 1-4 3Pt) and three rebounds in 25 minutes.Al Jefferson and Gerald Henderson were the two reasons why the Hornets were even in this game to begin with. Jefferson finished with 23 points (11-19 FG, 1-2 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots, while Henderson recorded 23 points (10-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT) of his own, to go along with two steals. Jefferson struggled to just three points and five rebounds in Monday's game against the Chicago Bulls, so it was good to see him come out with a nice bounce-back performance Wednesday. He's now averaging 16.9 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.7 assists on the season. The only other Hornet in double figures was Kemba Walker, who posted 11 points (4-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and six assists over 32 minutes. Coming off the bench, Mo Williams had an awful showing, going 2-for-10 from the field and just 1-for-6 from the three-point line, but still added nine points in 30 minutes.  The Nets' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, while the Hornets will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (47-25) beat the New York Knicks (14-58) 111-80 on Wednesday.All five starters for Los Angeles scored 11 or more points, they also each earned a plus/minus of plus-32 or higher in less than 29 minutes played in this slaughter of a basketball game. Austin Rivers, coach Doc Rivers' son, also scored in double figures. He led both teams in scoring with 21 points off the bench in 19 minutes, shot 9-for-10 from the field and converted on both of his free throw attempts.Lou Amundson's game doesn't usually involve piling up stats but Wednesday was likely a new low. In 15 minutes of action he failed to score on three attempts, grabbed one rebounds and had a minus-30 in the plus/minus statistic. One of the lone bright spots for the Knicks this season is Langston Galloway. He played a game-high 40 minutes and scored 11 points. Cleanthony Early was the Knicks top scorer against the Clippers, putting in 18 points and 25 minutes off the New York bench. The Knicks have dropped five straight, their second five-game losing streak in March.The Knicks will host the Boston Celtics on Friday. The Clippers will take on the 76ers in Philadelphia on Friday. 											",New York,Knicks,Los Angeles,Clippers,Madison Square Garden,47,25,14,58,5.0,23.0,29.0,82.0,17.0,19.0,34.0,14.0,20.0,9.0,25.0,40.0,70.0,11.0,16.0,35.0,29.0,12.0,Lou Amundson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Matt Barnes,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,27,Lance Thomas,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Blake Griffin,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,26,Andrea Bargnani,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,DeAndre Jordan,10.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,14.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Langston Galloway,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,40,Chris Paul,3.0,16.0,4.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,28,Shane Larkin,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,29,JJ Redick,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,21,Cole Aldrich,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Austin Rivers,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19,Jason Smith,8.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,23,Spencer Hawes,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,14,Cleanthony Early,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,24,Hedo Turkoglu,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,13,Ricky Ledo,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,14.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,26,Jordan Hamilton,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,19,Quincy Acy,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,18,Dahntay Jones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6

												The Atlanta Hawks (54-17) defeated the Orlando Magic (22-51) 95-83 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando.Taking their second loss in a row, the Magic were finally eliminated from playoff contention in the East. The Hawks, on the other hand, continued to build their lead as the top overall projected playoff seed. Despite losing five of their last ten games, they're still eight and a half games ahead of the second place Cleveland Cavaliers. Both teams struggled shooting the ball, as the Hawks went 43 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic finished at 41 percent from the floor and just 19 percent from deep.Paul Millsap led the way for the Hawks, finishing with 25 points (9-20 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT), 11 rebounds and four blocked shots. It was his second consecutive impressive performance, as he's now combined for 47 points and 18 rebounds over his last two games. Jeff Teague shot the ball well, going 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also adding nine assists. He hasn't necessarily been scoring all too much lately, considering he recorded 12 points or less in each of his last three games, so it was good to see the point guard have a little more success Wednesday. Nearly recording a double-double, Kyle Korver added 13 points (5-12 FG, 3-9 3Pt), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now pushed his season averages to 12.3 points and 4.1 rebounds on the year. Both Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll reached double figures in points as well with 10 and 11 points respectively.The Magic received another strong contribution from Elfrid Payton, who nearly triple-doubled with 19 points (7-19 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 5-7 FT), nine rebounds and seven assists over 35 minutes. He's been filling up the stat sheet of late and doing a little bit of everything, as he's averaging 14.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, 10.0 assists and three steals over his last three games. Nikola Vucevic also did his best to keep the Magic in this game, finishing with 16 points (8-15 FG) and 12 rebounds. He's had a couple solid games in a row, combining for 36 points and 20 rebounds over his last two games. Victor Oladipo didn't necessarily have the best night shooting the ball, but chipped in with 16 points (4-10 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 8-9 FT) and four assists as well. Over his last three games, he's averaging 20.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and five assists, but is shooting just 38 percent from the field.The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday, while the Magic will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Friday. 											",Orlando,Magic,Atlanta,Hawks,Amway Center,54,17,22,51,3.0,16.0,32.0,78.0,16.0,20.0,42.0,19.0,17.0,10.0,31.0,39.0,90.0,7.0,10.0,45.0,21.0,13.0,Tobias Harris,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,35,DeMarre Carroll,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,34,Dewayne Dedmon,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Paul Millsap,11.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,25.0,9.0,20.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,36,Nikola Vucevic,12.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,8.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,38,Al Horford,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,Victor Oladipo,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,39,Kyle Korver,8.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,36,Elfrid Payton,9.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,19.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,35,Jeff Teague,3.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,32,Willie Green,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,18,Pero Antic,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,21,Luke Ridnour,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,15,Kent Bazemore,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Aaron Gordon,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9,Dennis Schroder,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,20,Channing Frye,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Thabo Sefolosha,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,7,Andrew Nicholson,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,15,Elton Brand,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6

												The Indiana Pacers (31-40) defeated the Washington Wizards (40-32) 103-101 on Wednesday at the Verizon Center in Washington.Despite being down 76-70 coming out of the third quarter, the Pacers played with some urgency in the fourth, out-scoring the Wizards 33-25 to finish with the two-point victory on the road in Indianapolis. This marked a huge win for the Pacers, who are now tied with the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. With both the Brooklyn Nets and Charlotte Hornets just a half game behind the Pacers though, it should be a very tight race all the way till the end of the regular season. The Wizards, on the other hand, have now lost four straight, but still comfortably hold a four and a half game lead over the Milwaukee Bucks for the fifth spot in the East.George Hill was the savior for the Pacers though, as he made a layup with just two seconds left in the game to give them the two-point win. Along with the clutch bucket, he went off for a team-high of 29 points (12-24 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT), while also adding seven rebounds and nine assists. He continues to be the most consistent player on this team and is averaging 20.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 4.6 assists, while shooting 54 percent from the field during his last seven games. Hill received some help from C.J. Miles though, who added 16 points (5-10 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 3-4 FT) as the starter at shooting guard. After shooting just 19 percent (3-16 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Rockets, it was good to see Miles get back on the right track Wednesday. Coming up with a double-double, David West finished with 10 points (5-9 FG, 0-2 FT) and 11 rebounds. Solomon Hill was the other starter in double figures with 13 points (3-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) as well.John Wall did everything he could to keep the Wizards in this game, going 11-for-21 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 34 points, to go along with six assists and two steals as well. After shooting less than 40 percent during his last three games, Wall finally got his shot dialed in, which he'll need to continue to do if the Wizards want to make some noise in the playoffs. Marcin Gortat had a nice showing as well, posting 16 points (7-10 FG, 2-2 FT), seven rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now pushed his season averages to 11.9 points and 8.5 rebounds on the year.

Vasquez scored 22 points in 31 minutes but couldn't take his team to the winner's circle. Jonas Valunciunas was slowed down against Chicago's solid interior defense. He scored just eight points but managed to pull down 12 rebounds. Toronto has had a rough go in March, going just 5-8.     The Raptors have dropped three of four games, including two against Chicago, but will continue their quest to be the fourth team to lock up a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference when they face the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. The Bulls will host the New York Knicks on Saturday.

												The Miami Heat (33-38) defeated the Boston Celtics (31-40) 93-86 on Wednesday.The Heat bounced back from a devastating loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday, where Khris Middleton's buzzer beating three-pointer stopped them from being down just a half a game to the Bucks in the Eastern Conference standings. With Dwyane Wade (knee) and breakout center Hassan Whiteside (hand) out with injuries, Goran Dragic took over and scored 22 points with seven assists and five rebounds. Henry Walker and Mario Chalmers were deployed into the starting lineup for their injured teammates; they combined for 16 points, five rebounds and nine assists in spot starts. The Heat are now 9-5 in March with three games left to end the month.Boston was down by 17 at half but managed to outscore Miami 24-11 in the fourth quarter to make the score seem more respectable.

He came off the bench, as usual, and had scored four points in 20 minutes.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (47-26) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (50-22) 111-89 on Wednesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.Both teams have already clinched a playoff berth in their respective conferences, but it was the Cavaliers who were able to continue with their momentum, winning their fourth straight game Wednesday. They continue to sit as the second seed in the East, eight games back from the Atlanta Hawks. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, remain second in the West, and sit eight and a half games back from the Golden State Warriors. The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Grizzlies finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 24 percent from deep.While they only received 18 combined points from their bench, the Cavaliers' starters all had big games, with each finishing in double figure points. Kyrie Irving led the way with 24 points (9-21 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 4-5 FT), while also contributing two assists and two steals. It was his second solid performance in a row, as he's now combined for 44 points, nine assists and four steals over his last two games. Kevin Love looked as if he couldn't miss a shot, going 10-for-13 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 22 points, to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. Despite averaging 16.6 points on the season, he hadn't surpassed the 11-point mark in four games, so it was good to see him finally break out and have a solid game. LeBron James also had a strong showing, finishing with 20 points (7-15 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT), eight rebounds and five assists. Over his last three games, he's now averaging 25.7 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.7 steals.The Grizzlies received most of their production from Marc Gasol, who finished with a team-high of 18 points (7-15 FG, 4-6 FT), while adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. He's riding a nice two-game stretch, combining for 39 points and 11 rebounds. With the rest of the starters combining for just 22 points though, Gasol didn't get the help he needed for the Grizzlies to pull off the win. Beno Udrih played well off the bench. He went 7-for-10 from the field to score 15 points, while playing just 21 minutes. It was his highest point total since the end of January, as it marked one of the few bright spots in this game for the Grizzlies. Also coming off the bench, Jeff Green chipped in with 11 points (4-11 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five rebounds.The Cavaliers' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while the Grizzlies will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (19-51) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16-55) 101-99 in overtime on Wednesday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.Despite being down seven points coming out of the third quarter, the Timberwolves came back with a big fourth, out-scoring the Lakers 24-17 to even the score. It was Chase Budinger who forced this game into overtime, as he hit a three-pointer with just six seconds left in regulation. In overtime, it was rookie Jordan Clarkson of the Lakers who was the savior, as he got to the line with just a fraction of a second left in the game and showed no fear, knocking down both of his free throw attempts to seal the two-point victory. While both teams have been eliminated from the playoffs, it was clear neither wanted to settle for a loss in this one.Including the clutch free throws, Clarkson also recorded a team-high of 20 points (6-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 8-8 FT), to go along with five rebounds, five assists and two steals. He just had a 30-point, seven-assist performance against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, so it was another impressive showing for the rookie, who continues to display a lot of potential for the future. Starting alongside Clarkson, Jeremy Lin also played a factor in the win, finishing with 19 points (6-14 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and five assists in 29 minutes. Lin has really picked up his game of late, and is averaging 16.7 points, 5.3 assists and 1.3 steals over his last three games. Coming off the bench, Ed Davis was efficient during his 22 minutes on the court, going 7-for-9 from the field to score 14 points, to go along with nine rebounds.Including the three-pointer that sent this game to overtime, Budinger posted 22 points, while shooting 9-for-14 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line. Budinger has been a solid source of scoring for this team recently and is averaging 14.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.4 steals over his last five games. Andrew Wiggins was also a big reason the Timberwolves had a chance to win this game. He went 8-for-16 from the field and 10-for-11 from the free throw line to score a game-high of 27 points in 48 minutes. He's scored 20 or more points in three of his last four games, a stretch where he's averaging 20.5 points, while shooting 44 percent from the field. Rookie Zach LaVine continued to show his potential as well, finishing with 18 points (5-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 7-8 FT), six rebounds and five assists. During his last two games, he's combined for 45 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, as he's stepped up with injuries to Ricky Rubio (ankle) and Kevin Martin (hamstring).The Lakers' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Friday. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Los Angeles,Lakers,Target Center,19,51,16,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Wiggins,6.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,27.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,48,Wesley Johnson,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Adreian Payne,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,26,Ryan Kelly,8.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,37,Gorgui Dieng,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,32,Tarik Black,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Zach LaVine,6.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,18.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,47,Jordan Clarkson,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,20.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,37,Lorenzo Brown,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,34,Jeremy Lin,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,29,Chase Budinger,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,9.0,14.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,40,Ed Davis,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Sean Kilpatrick,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,24,Wayne Ellington,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,19.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,38,Justin Hamilton,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Robert Sacre,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Anthony Bennett,,,,,,,,,,,,Jabari Brown,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,32,Kevin Garnett,,,,,,,,,,,,Carlos Boozer,,,,,,,,,,,

Most Valuable Player award candidate James Harden continued his dominant season, as he recorded 25 points, 10 assists and six rebounds. His speciality is getting to the free throw line, but he went just 6-for-9 from the charity stripe in New Orleans.Breakout superstar Anthony Davis had 24 points, 14 rebounds, three steals and three blocks in 44 minutes, as he attempted to help his team improve their playoff chances. Tyreke Evans' ankle has been bothering him lately and forced him to miss Sunday's game, a 107-100 loss to the Clippers. Evans was able to play Wednesday and he dropped 28 points, seven assists, two steals and one block in 38 minutes on the Rockets. The Pelicans shortened their bench to just three players, Dante Cunningham, Alexis Ajinca and Norris Cole. They combined for 19 points, nine rebounds and each recorded two assists.New Orleans has lost four straight and will host the Sacramento Kings on Friday. The Rockets will welcome the Minnesota Timberwolves to town on Friday											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Houston,Rockets,Smoothie King Center,48,23,37,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Quincy Pondexter,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,30,Trevor Ariza,9.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,13.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,39,Anthony Davis,14.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,24.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,44,Donatas Motiejunas,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21.0,10.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,36,Omer Asik,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,25,Dwight Howard,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Eric Gordon,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,41,James Harden,6.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,9.0,20.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,37,Tyreke Evans,2.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,28.0,10.0,16.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,38,Jason Terry,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,27,Alexis Ajinca,5.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Joey Dorsey,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Dante Cunningham,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25,Pablo Prigioni,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,20,Norris Cole,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,18,Corey Brewer,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,26,Ryan Anderson,,,,,,,,,,,,Josh Smith,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,24,Luke Babbitt,,,,,,,,,,,,Nick Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Philadelphia 76ers (18-54) defeated the Denver Nuggets (27-45) 99-85 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Even though both teams have already been eliminated from playoff contention, this was still a hard fought game between the two. After being down four points coming out of the third quarter, the Sixers went off in the fourth, out-scoring the Nuggets 27-9 to finish off the 14-point victory on the road. The Sixers were the superior shooters in this game, going 42 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Nuggets went just 35 percent from the floor and a meager 28 percent from deep.Nerlens Noel was the only starter to reach double figures Wednesday, as he finished with 14 points (5-8 FG, 4-7 FT), while also adding 15 rebounds and four blocked shots in 33 minutes. It was his second double-double in a row, as he's combined for 28 points, 25 rebounds and 10 blocks over those last two games. It was the Sixers' bench combination of Isaiah Canaan and Robert Covington that made the difference in this one though. Canaan finished with 15 points (4-11 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and three rebounds, while Covington had a team-high of 25 points, while shooting 8-for-17 from the field and 6-for-11 from beyond the arc. Covington has been absolutely on fire from the three-point line, combining to go 11-for-17 from deep during his last two games alone. He's now pushed his season averages to 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.4 assists.Ty Lawson did his best to keep the Nuggets in this game, going 6-for-16 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while adding six assists and two steals. After going scoreless in 27 minutes against the Orlando Magic on Sunday, it was a nice bounce-back outing for Lawson, who's now averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 assists on the year. Wilson Chandler also had a solid showing, finishing with 16 points (4-14 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. The double-double was his first since the end of January, as Chandler was a force on the glass Wednesday. The only other Nugget in double figures was Jameer Nelson, who came off the bench for 12 points (6-16 FG, 0-6 3Pt) and four rebounds.The Sixers' next game will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Friday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (45-25) defeated the Utah Jazz (31-40) 92-89 on Wednesday.Iron man Damian Lillard led Portland with 23 points, 12 assists to go along with eight rebounds. He stepped it up as his team was without French swingman Nicolas Batum, who was out with a back injury. LaMarcus Aldridge has been dealing with hand and finger injuries all season but still manages to make the lineup on most nights. He sat out Tuesday night against the Golden State Warriors but was able to give it a go against the Jazz. He had 19 points and nine rebounds in 36 minutes. He and his fellow superstar teammate Lillard, were determined to end their losing streak at five games and scored 13 straight points to end the game. Despite their losing streak, that was snapped on Wednesday, they still hold a top five record in the Western Conference.The Jazz were without their leader Gordon Hayward for the second straight game, as he's dealing with a collarbone injury. Elijah Millsap was chosen to to start at small forward in his place. Millsap did a nice job; he scored nine points to go along with eight rebounds, three steals and two assists. Utah held a 10-point advantage heading into the fourth quarter but couldn't hold off the duo of Lillard and Aldridge.The Denver Nuggets will host the Jazz on Friday, and the Trail Blazers will head to Phoenix to take on the Suns.

												The San Antonio Spurs (45-26) blew out the Oklahoma City Thunder (41-31) 130-91 on Wednesday.Tony Parker outplayed Russell Westbrook and led his team to victory with 21 points, six assists, six rebounds and three steals in 28 minutes. The Spurs led by four after the first quarter and then increased that lead to 21 points at halftime after a phenomenal 39-point second quarter. They continued there dominant performance in the second half, averaging 29.5 points in the final two quarters. With the game in hand, the Spurs were able to deploy their bench players into the game early, every San Antonio player played at least 10 minutes.Russell Westbrook took a break from putting up Oscar Robertson numbers for an evening. For just the third time this month he failed to record double-digit assists or rebounds, and for just the second time in March he didn't record 24 points or more. Enes Kanter had a nice game in a losing effort. He matched Westbrook's 16 points to go along with 10 rebounds in 22 minutes. Mitch McGary had eight points, seven assists, three steals and one block in 23 minutes. His playing time had increased as the Thunder have dealt with injuries to pivotal players such as Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. Oklahoma City still holds the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.The Thunder will try and regroup before they play the Jazz on Saturday, and the Spurs will host the Mavericks on Friday.

												The Sacramento Kings (26-45) defeated the Phoenix Suns (38-34) 108-99 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.After the Oklahoma City Thunder got destroyed by the San Antonio Spurs earlier Wednesday, this was a huge opportunity for the Suns to pick up a game on the Thunder, who remain three games ahead of them for the eighth and final projected playoff spot in the Western Conference standings. Instead, the Kings were the ones who came out with some fire and picked up their fourth straight win, despite having already been eliminated from the playoffs. The Kings were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three-point line, while the Suns finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 24 percent from deep.It was a team-effort win for the Kings, who had seven players reach double figures in points. DeMarcus Cousins led the way, going 11-for-19 from the field to score 24 points, while also adding 11 rebounds and a blocked shot. It was his third double-double over his last four games, a stretch where he's averaging 24.3 points and 12.0 rebounds. Rudy Gay struggled with his shot, but still added 14 points (3-7 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 8-9 FT) and five assists. He had scored over 20 points in nine straight games coming into Wednesday, so it was somewhat of a disappointing performance for Gay, but with so many players getting in the action offensively for the Grizzlies, they were still able to finish off with a win. Starting at point guard, Ray McCallum added 14 points (6-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five assists. Despite averaging just 6.6 points per game on the year, this marked his third straight game in double figures. Coming off the bench, Nik Stauskas chipped in with an efficient 13 points (5-7 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and four rebounds in 18 minutes.Markieff Morris had the most production for the Suns, finishing with a team-high of 24 points (9-16 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT), to go along with seven rebounds and two steals. He's continued to stay very consistent for the Suns, averaging 19.6 points and 6.9 rebounds over his last seven games. The other Morris brother, Marcus, had a big game as well. He went 7-for-11 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 19 points in 26 minutes. He's shot over 50 percent from the field in two of his last three games, as he's dialed in and gaining some momentum. Eric Bledsoe added 19 points (7-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-5 FT) of his own, while also pulling down five rebounds. He's riding a nice three-game stretch, where he's averaging 24.3 points and 4.7 assists. Archie Goodwin had a strong showing off the bench as well, scoring 15 points (6-12 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) in 26 minutes.     The Kings' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, while the Suns will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday.

												The Detroit Pistons (27-44) topped the Toronto Raptors (42-29), 108-104, on Tuesday at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The Pistons exploded for 60 points in the first half to take a 12 point lead into the locker room. Toronto's Kyle Lowry gave it a go to start the game, but his back spasms flared back up and he was forced from the game. The Raptors went on a run and briefly took the lead in the fourth quarter until Reggie Jackson's free throws gave the Pistons the advantage. The Pistons and Raptors split the season series at two games apiece. Toronto made a game of it despite Lowry's injury, but couldn't close it out for the win. Greivis Vasquez filled in a point guard with seven points and four assists and Louis Williams poured in 19 points off the bench. The Raptors have a big matchup Wednesday against the Bulls, who lead them by a half game for the third seed in the Eastern Conference. Detroit has now won three straight games to improve to 27-44 on the season. Reggie Jackson had another big game for the Pistons with 28 points, nine assists, and zero turnovers. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope continued his hot shooting stretch with 26 points, 15 of which came on three pointers. Greg Monroe sat out of this game but is reportedly nearing a return to the floor. The Pistons will return to action Friday against the Magic. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Toronto,Raptors,Little Caesars Arena,42,29,27,44,12.0,29.0,40.0,93.0,16.0,24.0,42.0,26.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,Caron Butler,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,14,Terrence Ross,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,30,Anthony Tolliver,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,25,Amir Johnson,8.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Andre Drummond,18.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,21.0,8.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Jonas Valanciunas,8.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,10.0,17.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,35,DeMar DeRozan,10.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,5.0,17.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,42,Reggie Jackson,5.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,18.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,34,Kyle Lowry,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10,Jodie Meeks,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,23,Lou Williams,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,33,Spencer Dinwiddie,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,14,Greivis Vasquez,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,28,Joel Anthony,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Patrick Patterson,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,27,Tayshaun Prince,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,31,Tyler Hansbrough,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Shawne Williams,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,13,Landry Fields,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Milwaukee Bucks (35-36) defeated the Miami Heat (32-38) 89-88 on Tuesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.After losing six straight, the Bucks finally got a game to fall their way, as Khris Middleton was able to hit a game-winning three-pointer on the assist from Zaza Pachulia, who was barely able to save the ball from going out of bounds before finding Middleton. It was a big win for the Bucks, as they increased their lead over the Heat for the sixth projected playoff spot in the Eastern Conference standings to two and a half games. On the other hand, it was a tough loss for the Heat, who are now holding just a one game lead over the Celtics for seventh. With the Nets, Pacers, Hornets and Celtics all trailing them by less than three games, they can't afford very many losses from here on out.While they didn't have the best night shooting the ball, the Bucks did secure a hefty 53-34 rebounding advantage over the Heat, as three players reached double-digit rebounds. Ersan Ilyasova led the way, finishing with 19 points (7-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT), 11 rebounds and three blocked shots. It marked his second double-double over his last three games, a stretch where he's averaging 17.7 points and 10.0 rebounds. Notching a double-double of his own, Pachulia recorded 14 points (6-11 FG, 2-3 FT) and 11 rebounds. He also had seven assists, five steals and a blocked shot as well, doing some key things on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball. The five steals were a season-high for the center. Giannis Antetokounmpo played a huge factor in the comeback win as well, finishing with 16 points (6-10 FG, 4-4 FT), 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. He's been very impressive for the Bucks of late, averaging 18.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks over his last five games. Dwyane Wade did his best to keep the Heat in front of the Bucks, as he posted a team-high of 21 points (7-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 6-7 FT), to go along with four assists and three steals. Despite losing five of their last ten, Wade has been the model of consistency and has averaged 25.4 points, five assists and two steals over those last ten games. Fellow backcourt mate, Goran Dragic, also did his part despite taking the loss. He went 7-for-12 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also adding six assists as well. His shot has been falling at a high rate, considering he's finished over 50 percent from the field in four of his last five games. Luol Deng was the only other starter in double figures, as he chipped in with 13 points (5-13 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four rebounds. Unfortunately for the Heat, Hassan Whiteside had to leave the game after just 12 minutes due to suffering a laceration to his right hand.   The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Bucks will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday.  											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Miami,Heat,Fiserv Forum,32,38,35,36,4.0,17.0,36.0,87.0,13.0,17.0,53.0,25.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,Giannis Antetokounmpo,10.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,39,Luol Deng,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,34,Ersan Ilyasova,11.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,19.0,7.0,15.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,28,Udonis Haslem,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Zaza Pachulia,11.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,Hassan Whiteside,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Khris Middleton,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,17.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,39,Dwyane Wade,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,30,Michael Carter-Williams,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,26,Goran Dragic,3.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,40,Jerryd Bayless,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,36,Henry Walker,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,26,John Henson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Mario Chalmers,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,26,Tyler Ennis,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4,Chris Andersen,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,Miles Plumlee,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Michael Beasley,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,26,O.J.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (41-30) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (18-51) 127-117 on Tuesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.This marked another huge win for the Thunder, as they continue to hold on to the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. They pushed their lead on the Phoenix Suns to three games, while they also hold a three and a half game lead over the New Orleans Pelicans. If they can continue increasing their current four-game win streak, they could also catch up with the Dallas Mavericks, who are only three games above the Thunder and sit in the seventh spot. The Lakers, on the other hand, have already been eliminated from contention, and look as if they'll be getting one of the top draft picks in the 2015 NBA Draft.The Thunder shot very well, going 56 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three-point line. With Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka sidelined for the forseeable future with injuries, MVP candidate Russell Westbrook again had a big game. He went off for a team-high of 27 points (9-17 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 7-8 FT), while also coming up with 11 assists and two steals in 30 minutes. He continues to be one of the best, if not the best player so far in the second half of the season, as he's averaging 31.4 points, 10.1 rebounds and 11.5 assists over his last 14 games. Enes Kanter was a big factor in the win as well, finishing with 25 points (10-15 FG, 5-5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's really stepped up with Ibaka out, and has recorded six double-doubles in a row, while averaging 21.2 points and 12.2 rebounds during that span. Dion Waiters was the third Thunder starter to surpass the 20-point mark, as he posted 23 points (10-16 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four assists. Rookie Jordan Clarkson did everything he could to keep the Lakers in this game while starting at point guard. He went 12-for-19 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 30 points, to go along with seven assists and three blocked shots. It was a career-high in both points and blocks for Clarkson, as he continues to make his case for a larger role come next season. Starting alongside Clarkson, Jeremy Lin had a solid game as well, finishing with 19 points (6-11 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and seven assists. He's put together two impressive games in a row, as he just went off for 29 points and five assists against the Sixers on Sunday. Ryan Kelly was the third starter in double figures, as he recorded 16 points (5-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds in 29 minutes. Coming off the bench, Wayne Ellington chipped in with 15 points (6-14 FG, 3-6 3Pt) and three rebounds over 24 minutes as well.  The Thunder's next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, while the Lakers will travel to Minnesota to play the Timberwolves on Wednesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (45-27) picked up a huge victory Tuesday with a 101-94 win over the San Antonio Spurs (44-26) at the American Airlines Center. San Antonio got off to a hot start and took a 29-17 lead to end the first quarter, but Dallas battled back. The Mavericks, led by Monta Ellis' 38 points, shot 48 percent from the field as a team and outscored the Spurs 52-38 in the paint. Dallas leads the season series 2-1, but San Antonio will have a chance to even it on Friday when these teams meet at the AT&T Center. These teams are in a race for the sixth seed in the Western Conference as the Spurs are just percentage points ahead of the Mavericks. The Spurs had their three-game winning streak come to an end Tuesday just days after routing the East's top team, the Hawks, on Sunday. Manu Ginobili returned to action in this game after missing four games with an ankle injury. Ginobili finished with seven points in just 16 minutes as Gregg Popovich is working him back into the rotation. The Spurs have a big matchup with the Thunder on Wednesday before Friday's rematch with the Mavericks.Dallas had lost two straight coming into Tuesday's contest, but got back on track with a very important victory. Monta Ellis' 38 point outing was important to the shooter's psyche after he was a frigid 4-for-22 on Sunday against Phoenix. Richard Jefferson was forced from the game with back spasms and did not return to the floor. The Mavericks will look to win the tiebreaker over the Spurs on Friday when they square off in San Antonio. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,San Antonio,Spurs,American Airlines Center,44,26,45,27,6.0,21.0,41.0,86.0,10.0,13.0,48.0,21.0,16.0,8.0,28.0,35.0,84.0,12.0,16.0,41.0,16.0,15.0,Chandler Parsons,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,40,Kawhi Leonard,9.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,35,Dirk Nowitzki,13.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,Tim Duncan,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Tyson Chandler,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,30,Tiago Splitter,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,21,Monta Ellis,2.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,38.0,16.0,27.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,39,Danny Green,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,17.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,27,Rajon Rondo,9.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,26,Tony Parker,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,26,Al-Farouq Aminu,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,20,Boris Diaw,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,29,Devin Harris,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,25,Marco Belinelli,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,18,Amar'e Stoudemire,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Matt Bonner,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11,Richard Jefferson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2,Patty Mills,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,20,Raymond Felton,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,Manu Ginobili,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,16

												The Sacramento Kings (25-45) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (17-54) 107-106 on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.Despite already having been eliminated from the playoffs, the Kings finished with another solid win Tuesday, pushing their streak to three in a row. The Kings shot much worse from the field and three-point line than the Sixers, but were able to force them into 21 turnovers, while committing just 10 of their own, so that ended up being the difference in this one. They also had a large advantage from the free throw line, converting on 30-of-38 attempts, while the Sixers made just 13-of-21. It was the duo of DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay who led the Kings to this win. Cousins was nearly unstoppable, finishing with a game-high of 33 points (8-27 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 17-19 FT), to go along with 17 rebounds, four steals and four blocked shots. It was the third game over his last five where he scored 30 points or more, as he's been an absolute force. During that five-game stretch, he's averaging 25.8 points, 12.8 rebounds and a block, while shooting 48 percent from the field. Gay, on the other hand, went 6-for-19 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while also adding eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He's also been very consistent with his production of late, and is averaging 26.4 points and 5.4 rebounds over his last five games. The only other King in double figures was Ray McCallum, who scored 11 points (5-17 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 0-2 FT) and added six rebounds as the starter at point guard. Robert Covington shot the ball well Tuesday, going 7-for-9 from the field and 5-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 21 points. He had really been struggling offensively over his last four games, shooting less than 35 percent from the field in three out of those four, so it was refreshing to see him have much more success this time around. Nerlens Noel came out and notched a double-double, finishing with 14 points (5-10 FG, 4-5 FT), 10 rebounds and six blocked shots. He's on a solid stretch of seven games, where he's averaging 14.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and two blocked shots, so that trend continued Tuesday. Coming off the bench, Thomas Robinson chipped in with 16 points and eight rebounds as well, as he went 7-for-12 from the field in just 21 minutes of action. The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Sixers will travel to Denver to play the Nuggets on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (58-13) had an emphatic victory Tuesday in Portland, defeating the Trail Blazers (44-25) 122-108 to clinch the Pacific Division.Golden State saved its best for the best competition with its best shooting performance of the year. The Warriors shot a remarkable 60.2% from the floor on their way to putting up 122 points against the Trail Blazers, who were missing LaMarcus Aldridge and Nicolas Batum. This matchup showcased two of the best point guards in the game with Steph Curry putting up 33 points while Damian Lillard finished with 29. The Warriors broke the game open in the third quarter with a 21-3 run, leading to a 36 point quarter. The Trail Blazers and Warriors will wrap up the season series on April 9 at the Oracle Arena. Just one night after dismantling the East's fifth-best team, the Wizards, the Warriors put on a show against the West's fourth seed. Golden State hadn't won a division title since the 1975-76 season where it lost in the conference finals. They are now one win shy of tying the franchise record for wins, a mark they should easily top. The Warriors dished out 37 assists in the game and scored 52 points in the paint. Golden State will return to action Friday when it hosts Memphis. Portland has started to slide over the past week with five straight losses. LaMarcus Aldridge, Nicolas Batum, and Chris Kaman were all sidelined with injuries, which forced Portland to reach deep into its bench with players like C.J McCollum and Joel Freeland both playing more than 20 minutes. It's unclear if any of those three players will be available for Wednesday's tilt in Utah. 											",Portland,Trail Blazers,Golden State,Warriors,Moda Center,58,13,44,25,15.0,34.0,39.0,92.0,15.0,19.0,35.0,23.0,10.0,12.0,26.0,50.0,83.0,10.0,11.0,46.0,37.0,13.0,Alonzo Gee,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Harrison Barnes,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,35,Dorell Wright,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,20,Draymond Green,11.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,14.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,37,Robin Lopez,7.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Andrew Bogut,16.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Arron Afflalo,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,28,Klay Thompson,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,25,Damian Lillard,7.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,9.0,21.0,6.0,11.0,4.0,32,Stephen Curry,2.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,33.0,13.0,22.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,35,CJ McCollum,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,18.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,28,Justin Holiday,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,18,Joel Freeland,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Andre Iguodala,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,11.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,31,Allen Crabbe,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,23,Festus Ezeli,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Meyers Leonard,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Leandro Barbosa,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,Steve Blake,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,15,Marreese Speights,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4

												The Houston Rockets (47-23) defeated the Indiana Pacers (30-40) 110-100 on Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. After winning seven games in a row during the start of March and pushing themselves into the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference standings, the Pacers have now turned completely in the opposite direction and have gone on to lose six straight games. The loss doesn't take them out of the playoff race though, as they sit just a game back from the Charlotte Hornets for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the East. The Rockets, on the other hand, were on a poor streak of their own, as they were losers of four straight. The win gets them back on the right track though, as they still hold a two-game lead over the Portland Trail Blazers for the third projected playoff seed in the Western Conference.The Rockets shot fairly well in this game, going 48 percent from the field and 54 percent from the three-point line. James Harden was nearly unstoppable, as he went off for a game-high of 44 points (10-21 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 21-22 FT), to go along with four rebounds, seven assists and two steals. He continues to make his push for the league MVP, as this was the second time in three games that he's posted over 40 points. During that three-game stretch, Harden has averaged an impressive 36.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists. Donatas Motiejunas also played a big factor in the win, going 6-for-9 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 17 points. It was his third time shooting over 60 percent from the field during the last four games, as his shot is clearly dialed in at the moment. The Rockets also saw some solid contributions from their bench, with both Josh Smith and Corey Brewer reaching double figures in points. Smith finished with 18 points (7-14 FG, 4-6 3Pt) and five rebounds, while Brewer had 11 points (2-6 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and two rebounds. Also, Patrick Beverley had to leave the game with a wrist injury after just 20 minutes and wasn't able to return, so it's questionable how severe his injury could be.C.J. Watson had a big performance off the bench for the Pacers. He went 7-for-10 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score 23 points, while also adding five assists over 30 minutes. After going 0-for-6 from beyond the arc during Saturday's game against the Brooklyn Nets, Watson was able to turn things back around and get pointed in the right direction Monday. George Hill also played well despite suffering the loss. He led the starters with 20 points (9-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 0-1 FT), to go along with six rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocked shots, as he did a little bit of everything for the Pacers. He's shot over 50 percent in each of his last three games, a stretch where he's currently averaging 20.7 points as the scoring leader for this team. Notching his first double-double in six games was Roy Hibbert, who posted 18 points (8-12 FG, 2-2 FT) and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. David West also reached double-digit points with 10 (4-13 FG, 2-4 FT) of his own, despite struggling from the field.   The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Pacers will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Wednesday. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Houston,Rockets,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,47,23,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Solomon Hill,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,25,Trevor Ariza,11.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,31,David West,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Donatas Motiejunas,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,37,Roy Hibbert,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,Joey Dorsey,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,CJ Miles,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,16.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,32,James Harden,4.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,44.0,10.0,21.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,43,George Hill,6.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,20.0,9.0,15.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,35,Patrick Beverley,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,19,Damjan Rudez,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,21,Corey Brewer,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25,Ian Mahinmi,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,15,Josh Smith,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,28,C.J.

												The Boston Celtics (31-39) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (29-40) 110-91 on Monday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Celtics got a big win Monday, as they jumped the Charlotte Hornets for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. They now sit tied with the Hornets, but own the tiebreaker, while also trailing the Miami Heat by just a game and a half. The Nets, on the other hand, are still in the thick of things as well, considering they're only a game and a half behind the Celtics for that final spot. It's a tight race for those final two projected playoff spots, with the Heat, Celtics, Hornets, Pacers and Nets all within three games of each other. The Celtics were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the floor and 27 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets went just 36 percent from the field and an embarrassing six percent from beyond the arc. The win was a true team effort for the Celtics though, with six players reaching double figures. Avery Bradley led the way, finishing with a team-high of 20 points (8-16 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT), to go along with seven rebounds in 32 minutes. After shooting just 30 percent (3-10 FG) from the field during Sunday's matchup with the Pistons, it was a nice bounce-back game for Bradley. Evan Turner came up with a surprise triple-double, finishing with 19 points (9-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT), 10 rebounds and 12 assists. It was his third straight impressive game, averaging 19.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and eight assists during that span. Coming just shy of double-double, Tyler Zeller posted 18 points (9-13 FG) and seven rebounds in 30 minutes. The Celtics also had a strong bench showing with Kelly Olynyk recording an efficient 18 points (7-12 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and five rebounds in just 17 minutes, while Jonas Jerebko added 10 points (5-12 FG, 0-2 3Pt) and six rebounds of his own. The Nets received nearly all of their production from center Brook Lopez, who went off for a game-high of 31 points (12-19 FG, 7-7 FT), to go along with four rebounds over 35 minutes. He's been an absolute beast for the Nets over his last three games and has averaged 29.7 points and 8.7 rebounds during that span. Deron Williams nearly matched Turner with a triple-double of his own, posting 10 points (2-6 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 6-6 FT), nine rebounds and 10 assists in 34 minutes. He's now pushed his season averages to 12.9 points, 3.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on the year. The only other Net in double figures was Thaddeus Young, who finished with 12 points (5-12 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and nine rebounds.     The Celtics' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday, while the Nets will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday.

												The Chicago Bulls (43-29) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (30-39) 98-86 on Monday at the United Center in Chicago.It marked a tough loss for the Hornets, as the Boston Celtics jumped a half game ahead of them for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. With just 13 games left in the regular season, the Hornets are going to need to pick up some winning momentum moving forward, as teams like the Heat, Celtics, Pacers and Nets all sit within three games of each other and will fight for the final two playoff spots in the East. The Bulls, on the other hand, have clinched their spot in the playoffs and still sit as the fourth seed in the standings, with the Toronto Raptors sitting just above them with the tie breaker. With a strong finish to the season, they'll have the opportunity to pass up the Raptors, but they could be passed up themselves, as the Washington Wizards are trailing the Bulls by just two games.  Nikola Mirotic continued to have a huge presence for the Bulls, recording over 20 points for the fourth time over his last five games. In 32 minutes off the bench, he finished with a team-high of 28 points (10-19 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 7-10 FT), while also adding eight rebounds and a blocked shot. Over his last five games, he's now boasting averages of 20.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.8 blocks, while shooting 43 percent from the field. Pau Gasol was also a force in this game, posting 27 points (11-19 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT) of his own, to go along with 12 rebounds and four blocked shots. He's posted two double-doubles in a row, combining for an impressive 54 points and 22 rebounds over those two matchups. On the season, Gasol is now averaging 18.6 points and 11.9 rebounds as the clear leader of this team. The biggest news for the Bulls though, was seeing Jimmy Butler return to the starting lineup after missing 12 games with an elbow injury. He didn't seem to have any trouble with his elbow and posted 19 points (6-20 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 7-10 FT) and nine rebounds, while playing a full 39 minutes. Aaron Brooks added a double-double as well, finishing with 13 points (6-10 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and 10 assists.The Hornets struggled to get things going offensively Monday. Kemba Walker was one of the few exceptions, going off for a game-high of 29 points (11-24 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT) with two assists in 34 minutes. He had shot under 40 percent from the field in nine straight games coming into Monday, so it was good to finally see him have a better night with his shot and come out shooting 46 percent from the floor. Mo Williams came off the bench again in this one and scored 15 points (4-16 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 4-5 FT), while also posting six rebounds and five assists. He's had two solid showings in a row, combining for 39 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists over that span. The only other Hornet in double figures was Gerald Henderson, who chipped in with 11 points (3-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and nine rebounds, despite having a tough night shooting the ball. Al Jefferson had to leave the game after just 24 minutes with soreness in his right knee, so the Hornets can only hope it doesn't continue to keep him out moving forward.   The Bulls' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, while the Hornets will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday. 											",New York,Knicks,Memphis,Grizzlies,Madison Square Garden,50,21,14,57,,,,,,,,,,7.0,11.0,41.0,77.0,14.0,19.0,38.0,22.0,10.0,Lou Amundson,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,21,Jeff Green,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,34,Lance Thomas,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,38,Zach Randolph,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Andrea Bargnani,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,18.0,8.0,18.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,31,Marc Gasol,8.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Langston Galloway,7.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,16.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,42,Tony Allen,7.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,26,Shane Larkin,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,43,Mike Conley,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,25,Jason Smith,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,27,Nick Calathes,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16,Cole Aldrich,7.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Beno Udrih,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Ricky Ledo,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Kosta Koufos,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Quincy Acy,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11,Vince Carter,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,20,Cleanthony Early,,,,,,,,,,,,JaMychal Green,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6

												The Memphis Grizzlies (50-21) defeated the New York Knicks (14-57) 103-82 on Monday at Madison Square Garden in New York.While the Knicks have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Grizzlies continue to sit comfortable in the top half of the Western Conference standings. They currently remain two and a half games above the Houston Rockets for the second seed in the West, but also trail the Golden State Warriors by seven games for the top overall seed. The Grizzlies were the much better shooting team in this game, going 52 percent from the field and an impressive 58 percent from the three-point line, while the Knicks ended at just 42 percent from the floor and a meager 22 percent from deep. The Grizzlies' starting frontcourt came up big again Monday, as they combined to score 56 of the 103 total points. Zach Randolph led the way, finishing with a team-high of 23 points (9-12 FG, 5-6 FT), to go along with seven rebounds and five assists. He's played well of late for Memphis and is averaging 19.0 points and 7.2 rebounds over his last five games. Marc Gasol also had a strong showing, posting 21 points (9-17 FG, 3-5 FT) and eight rebounds over 32 minutes. Gasol shot just 27 percent (4-15 FG) from the field during Saturday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers, so it was good to see him have a lot more success on Monday. Jeff Green chipped in with 12 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds as well. It was Vince Carter and Kosta Koufos who provided a nice push off the bench. Carter finished with 14 points (4-8 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 21 minutes, while Koufos recorded 10 points (5-7 FG) and five rebounds in 16 minutes. Langston Galloway did his best to keep the Knicks in this game, going 7-for-16 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 19 points, while also adding seven rebounds and five assists. He had combined to go 5-for-22 from the floor and just 1-for-7 from deep over his last two games, so it was a breath of fresh air for Knicks' fans seeing Galloway shoot a little better Monday. Andrea Bargnani did his part as well, posting 18 points (8-18 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and two blocked shots in 31 minutes. He's been one of the more consistent players for this team, averaging 16.8 points, 4.4 rebounds and one blocked shot during his last 10 games. With Alexey Shved sidelined with a rib injury, Shane Larkin moved into the starting lineup, but he contributed just four points (2-7 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and seven assists in 43 minutes. Lance Thomas chipped in with 15 points (6-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and two steals, while Jason Smith came off the bench for 16 points (6-12 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four rebounds.  The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, while the Knicks will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (16-54) defeated the Utah Jazz (31-39) 106-104 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City. After Trey Burke hit two free throws to put the Utah Jazz up by three with just under 20 seconds left in the game, rookie guard Zach LaVine came back and hit a three-pointer for the Timberwolves to tie the game with just over 12 seconds left in regulation. Burke then had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but he missed a three-point shot and it went to overtime. While it was a close overtime battle, the Timberwolves were able to come out on top, securing the two-point victory on the road, something they've only done seven times this season.  Including two three-pointers in the final 22 seconds of regulation that kept Minnesota in the game and some clutch free throws at the end of overtime, LaVine was the star for the Timberwolves Monday. He went 7-for-19 from the field and 5-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 27 points, while also posting four assists in 46 minutes. It was a career-high in points for the guard, who's now scored 20 points or more three times over his last five games. During that five-game stretch, he's averaging 14.8 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists as he's beginning to find his groove. Don't overlook the performance from Andrew Wiggins though, who finished with 22 points (10-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) of his own, to go along with seven rebounds and two steals. He's shot the ball well of late, going 50 percent or higher from the field in three out of his last four games. Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger added 15 points (4-13 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and five assists, while Sean Kilpatrick added a career-high of 13 points (4-7 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in just his second NBA regular season game ever. With Gordon Hayward out due to a collarbone injury, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert did everything they could to keep the Jazz afloat. Each recorded a double-double, as Favors posted 19 points (8-13 FG, 3-7 FT) and 12 rebounds, while Gobert had 18 points (7-11 FG, 4-8 FT), 17 rebounds and six blocked shots. Favors has posted two double-doubles in a row now, combining for 40 points and 23 rebounds during that span. Starting for Hayward, Joe Ingles made the most of the start, going 7-for-10 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 18 points. It was a season-high in points for Ingles, who's only reached double-digit points in 10 games this season. Trey Burke really struggled with his shot off the bench, but still chipped in with 16 points (4-22 FG, 2-13 3Pt, 6-6 FT), six assists and four steals in 38 minutes.    The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Vivint Smart Home Arena,16,54,31,39,9.0,28.0,38.0,87.0,19.0,31.0,46.0,21.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,Joe Ingles,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,34,Andrew Wiggins,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22.0,10.0,19.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,48,Derrick Favors,12.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,19.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,41,Adreian Payne,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Rudy Gobert,17.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,18.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,41,Gorgui Dieng,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,44,Rodney Hood,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,20,Zach LaVine,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,7.0,19.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,45,Dante Exum,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,25,Lorenzo Brown,7.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,44,Trey Burke,1.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,22.0,2.0,13.0,5.0,38,Chase Budinger,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,39,Trevor Booker,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Sean Kilpatrick,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,19,Elijah Millsap,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,30,Anthony Bennett,,,,,,,,,,,,Bryce Cotton,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,11,Kevin Garnett,,,,,,,,,,,,Jeremy Evans,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Justin Hamilton,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Golden State Warriors (57-13) defeated the Washington Wizards (40-31) 107-76 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. This game looked like it was going to be a close one when the Warriors were up just two points at the half. They came out firing in the third quarter though, out-scoring the Wizards 29-8, which allowed them to eventually coast to the convincing 31-point victory in front of their home crowd. With the win, the Warriors extended their Western Conference lead to seven and a half games over the Memphis Grizzlies, while the Wizards sit in the fifth projected playoff seed in the East, five and a half games ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks. Stephen Curry had himself a night, going 8-for-14 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 24 points, while also adding five rebounds and six assists in just 28 minutes. His numbers could have been a lot higher, but he didn't have to play as much due to blowout. Curry has combined to shoot 8-for-14 from the three-point line over his last two games, helping him score 48 points over that span as well. He's now averaging 23.3 points and 7.9 assists per game on the season. Marreese Speights also played a factor in the win. He played just 14 minutes off the bench, but finished with an efficient 16 points (6-9 FG, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds. Draymond Green also chipped in with 13 points (5-11 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 0-2 FT) and six rebounds. With all the starters playing less than 30 minutes, the bench got a ton of extra time, as a total of 13 players ended up playing at least nine minutes on Monday.   The Wizards really struggled to get anything going. Their starting frontcourt was miserable, as Marcin Gortat, Nene Hilario and Paul Pierce combined for just 18 points between the three. John Wall and Bradley Beal were the only starters in double figures. Wall posted 11 points (4-16 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT), five rebounds and five assists, while Beal had 12 points (4-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and two rebounds. Wall looks to be struggling lately, combining to go just 7-for-26 from the floor and 1-for-6 from the three-point line over his last two games. He'll need to play much better than that if the Wizards want to make some noise in the playoffs. Ramon Sessions and Kevin Seraphin both reached double figures off the bench with 12 points apiece.  The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, while the Wizards will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Washington,Wizards,Chase Center,40,31,57,13,12.0,30.0,30.0,78.0,12.0,15.0,56.0,19.0,10.0,3.0,11.0,26.0,77.0,19.0,26.0,37.0,14.0,10.0,Harrison Barnes,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,21,Paul Pierce,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,23,Draymond Green,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,21,Nene,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,28,Andrew Bogut,12.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Marcin Gortat,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Klay Thompson,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,17,Bradley Beal,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,34,Stephen Curry,5.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,28,John Wall,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,32,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Martell Webster,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Festus Ezeli,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Ramon Sessions,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,19,David Lee,9.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Drew Gooden,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Andre Iguodala,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,20,Kevin Seraphin,8.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Shaun Livingston,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,DeJuan Blair,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (46-26) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (34-36) on Sunday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center by a score of 108-90. Milwaukee took a nine point lead into halftime, but it was all Cleveland in the second half. The Cavaliers put on a three point shooting clinic in the fourth to break the game open with a 15 point lead. J.R Smith hit seven of his nine three point attempts and finished with 23 points. The Bucks will try to tie the season-series with the Cavaliers on April 8. Cleveland has now won three straight games and are solidly positioned in the second seed in the East. LeBron James was dominant again with 28 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, and five steals over 39 minutes. Kevin Love had a quiet game, however, posting just nine points and three rebounds in 29 minutes. The Cavaliers will have a couple days off before traveling to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Wenesday. Milwaukee has hit the skids of late and has now lost six in a row. The Bucks' recent slide has put their hold on the sixth seed in jeopardy as they only lead the Heat by 1.5 games. A big problem Sunday was a lack of production from Milwaukee's bench, which only contributed 16 points, seven rebounds, and two assists as a collective. The Bucks will look to rebound on Tuesday with a crucial game against the Heat. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Cleveland,Cavaliers,Fiserv Forum,46,26,34,36,3.0,12.0,38.0,70.0,11.0,14.0,39.0,23.0,23.0,13.0,30.0,42.0,83.0,11.0,16.0,35.0,22.0,13.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,9.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,35,LeBron James,10.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,28.0,10.0,17.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,39,Ersan Ilyasova,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,33,Kevin Love,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,13.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,29,Zaza Pachulia,9.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,30,Timofey Mozgov,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Khris Middleton,5.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,39,JR Smith,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,11.0,7.0,9.0,2.0,36,Michael Carter-Williams,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,19.0,9.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,33,Kyrie Irving,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,19.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,30,Jerryd Bayless,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,23,Iman Shumpert,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,29,John Henson,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,14,Tristan Thompson,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Chris Johnson,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,15,James Jones,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Tyler Ennis,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Matthew Dellavedova,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Miles Plumlee,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Kendrick Perkins,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (40-30) defeated the Miami Heat (32-37) 93-75 on Sunday in Oklahoma City. The Thunder essentially controlled the game from start to finish with Enes Kanter leading the way in one of his best performances of the season. Kanter finished with 27 points on 12-of-20 shooting and 12 rebounds in 34 minutes. Kanter has now had five straight games with a double-double and is averaging 21.8 points and 13.6 rebounds over that stretch. Russell Westbrook had yet another triple-double in Sunday's game, posting 12 points on 5-of-16 shooting, 17 assists and 10 rebounds in 34 minutes. The triple-double is now Westbrook's league-leading 10th. Steven Adams and Dion Waiters each scored 10 points to round out the four Oklahoma City starters who scored in double figures, while Mitch McGary (14) and Anthony Morrow (12) round out all six Thunder players in double figures. Andre Roberson left the game early in the first quarter after suffering from a sprained ankle.Oklahoma City has now won three in a row and five of their last six, and the win brings their lead for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference to 2.5 games over the Pelicans. This loss ended a three-game winning streak for the Heat, and they played pretty poor as a team in the losing effort, recording just 13 assists to 18 turnovers. Hassan Whiteside recorded just 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting and six rebounds in 24 minutes. Dwyane Wade has been hot as of late, but he cooled off in Sunday's matchup, scoring just 12 points on 6-of-15 shooting in 31 minutes. Goran Dragic also struggled, also posting 12 points on 4-of-10 shooting in 34 minutes. Mario Chalmers (12) and Michael Beasley (10) round out the five Miami players who scored in double figures. Despite the loss, the Heat remain in seventh place in the Eastern Conference playoff race and are just 1.5 games behind the Bucks for sixth. Up next, the Thunder will head to Los Angeles Tuesday and go up against the Lakers, while the Heat will travel to Milwaukee and play the Bucks on Tuesday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Miami,Heat,Chesapeake Energy Arena,32,37,40,30,6.0,16.0,40.0,87.0,7.0,13.0,50.0,25.0,17.0,3.0,18.0,32.0,81.0,8.0,15.0,41.0,13.0,17.0,Dion Waiters,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,32,Luol Deng,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,27,Enes Kanter,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,27.0,12.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Udonis Haslem,7.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,21,Steven Adams,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Hassan Whiteside,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Andre Roberson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Dwyane Wade,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,31,Russell Westbrook,9.0,17.0,4.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,16.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,33,Goran Dragic,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,34,Anthony Morrow,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,29,Mario Chalmers,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,14.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,33,Mitch McGary,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,25,Michael Beasley,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,19,D.J.

												The San Antonio Spurs (44-25) routed the Atlanta Hawks (53-17) 114-95 on Sunday at the Philips Arena. The Spurs broke the game open with a 25-8 run to end the first half and things got worse from there for the Hawks. Coach Mike Budenholzer, a Greg Popovich protege, was ejected early in the third quarter with the Hawks down 25. Atlanta was looking to turn things around after a subpar end to its road trip, but its recent struggles traveled home to the Philips Arena. The Hawks never came within 15 points of the Spurs in the fourth as they dropped their season-high third straight game. San Antonio has now won three straight and is now within striking distance of the third seed in the West after a lackluster February had many questioning this team's viability in the playoffs. Kawhi Leonard had another strong outing with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists to go with four steals. Boris Diaw had a big fourth quarter and finished with 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting off the bench.  The Spurs have a tough schedule over the next week with two games against the Mavericks along with matchups against the Thunder and Grizzlies. Atlanta needs to regroup after being routed in two of its last three games. Paul Millsap tried to will his team to a comeback in the third quarter, but the Spurs never let the Hawks get too close. Millsap finished with 22 points and seven rebounds. Kyle Korver returned to the lineup after missing the last three games with a broken nose. He posted six points and three rebounds but also had five turnovers. The Hawks will have the next two days off before traveling to Orlando to take on the Magic on Wednesday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,San Antonio,Spurs,State Farm Arena,44,25,53,17,11.0,22.0,35.0,75.0,6.0,6.0,25.0,24.0,18.0,7.0,16.0,44.0,78.0,15.0,17.0,42.0,30.0,16.0,DeMarre Carroll,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,32,Kawhi Leonard,10.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,31,Paul Millsap,7.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,17.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,33,Tim Duncan,7.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Al Horford,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Tiago Splitter,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Kyle Korver,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,29,Danny Green,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,33,Jeff Teague,1.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,28,Tony Parker,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Pero Antic,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Boris Diaw,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,22,Kent Bazemore,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Marco Belinelli,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,24,Dennis Schroder,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,23,Aron Baynes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,Shelvin Mack,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Patty Mills,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Elton Brand,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Matt Bonner,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5

												The Los Angeles Clippers (46-25) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (37-33) by a score of 107-100 on Sunday at the Staples Center. New Orleans' Anthony Davis returned to the floor after missing the past two games with an ankle injury. Davis was outstanding Sunday with 26 points on 11-of-13 shooting to go with 12 rebounds and two blocks. However, Los Angeles' overall team strength was too much for New Orleans to overcome as Blake Griffin, J.J Redick, and Chris Paul all scored 20 or more points en route to the victory.  New Orleans was in dire need of a win Sunday after dropping two straight to fall further back in the West's playoff picture, but not even Anthony Davis' presence could make the difference. Tyreke Evans missed Sunday's game with an ankle injury and Eric Gordon moved to the bench. Gordon was effective in his role, however, scoring 23 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Omer Asik also missed this game with a calf injury, but Alexis Ajinca filled in admirably with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Los Angeles has now won four straight to maintain its position in the West's crowded playoff picture. The Clippers needed this win to avoid being caught by the Spurs in the standings after San Antonio routed Atlanta earlier in the afternoon. Blake Griffin continued to look strong since returning from elbow surgery with 23 points, five rebounds, and four assists in 37 minutes going toe to toe with Anthony Davis. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,New Orleans,Pelicans,Staples Center,37,33,46,25,7.0,23.0,42.0,91.0,16.0,23.0,42.0,25.0,10.0,12.0,22.0,38.0,75.0,12.0,16.0,41.0,21.0,18.0,Matt Barnes,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,34,Dante Cunningham,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,35,Blake Griffin,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,10.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37,Anthony Davis,12.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,26.0,11.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,39,DeAndre Jordan,16.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,37,Alexis Ajinca,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,JJ Redick,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,16.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,29,Quincy Pondexter,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,37,Chris Paul,7.0,11.0,4.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,19.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,37,Norris Cole,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,26,Austin Rivers,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,18,Eric Gordon,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,7.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,37,Hedo Turkoglu,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,13,Jimmer Fredette,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Nate Robinson,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,10,Jeff Withey,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Spencer Hawes,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Elliot Williams,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Glen Davis,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Luke Babbitt,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,11

												The Toronto Raptors (42-28) defeated the New York Knicks (14-56) 106-89 on Sunday in Toronto. The Raptors dominated the game from start to finish with DeMar DeRozan leading the way, scoring 23 points on 8-of-15 shooting, grabbing seven rebounds and dishing out five assists in 36 minutes. The performance marks the fifth consecutive game DeRozan has scored 20-plus points and he has reached the threshold in all 11 games played in the month of March except one. Kyle Lowry missed his second straight game for Toronto with a back injury. In his absence Greivis Vasquez got his second straight start and scored 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting in 34 minutes. Jonas Valanciunas recorded a double-double of 17 points and 10 rebounds in 27 minutes, and the effort was his third double-double in four outings. Tyler Hansbrough (18), Lou Williams (13) and Terrence Ross (11) round out the six Raptors who scored in double figures. The win leaves Toronto all alone in third place in the Eastern Conference with just a half-game lead over Chicago for that spot, and they are still three games behind the Cavaliers for second place. The Knicks continue to be the Knicks, as the loss was their third in a row and 10th in their last 12 outings, as they continue to boast the worst record in the NBA. Lance Thomas had his best game of the season, scoring 24 points on 9-of-12 shooting in 38 minutes. Andrea Bargnani was the only other New York player to score in double figures, posting 16 points on 6-of-13 shooting in 33 minutes. Up next, the Raptors will travel to Detroit on Tuesday to take on the Pistons, while New York will go up against the Grizzlies at home on Monday. 											",Toronto,Raptors,New York,Knicks,Scotiabank Arena,14,56,42,28,4.0,11.0,39.0,75.0,24.0,29.0,44.0,22.0,16.0,8.0,18.0,34.0,81.0,10.0,14.0,37.0,23.0,11.0,Terrence Ross,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,30,Lance Thomas,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,38,Amir Johnson,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,24,Lou Amundson,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Jonas Valanciunas,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Andrea Bargnani,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,DeMar DeRozan,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,36,Alexey Shved,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,17,Greivis Vasquez,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,34,Langston Galloway,2.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,38,Lou Williams,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,27,Cole Aldrich,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Patrick Patterson,8.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,26,Jason Smith,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22,James Johnson,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12,Shane Larkin,3.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,32,Tyler Hansbrough,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Travis Wear,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Bruno Caboclo,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Ricky Ledo,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8

												The Sacramento Kings (24-25) routed the visiting Washington Wizards (40-30),109-86 on Sunday at the Sleep Train Arena.Sacramento simply outplayed Washington for much of the game and really started to pull away in the third. A seven point lead at halftime for the Kings suddenly ballooned to 20 by the end of the third quarter. Bradley Beal was the only Wizard in double figures until midway through the third and finished with a team-high 19 points. Sacramento built a large lead over Washington when they met last Saturday, but was intent on not letting the lead slip away this time as they evened the season series at one game apiece. Washington's four-game road trip got off to a promising start Wednesday with a hard fought victory over Utah, but has since sputtered out with two straight losses. John Wall had a poor outing by his standards, going 3-for-10 from the field to end up with nine points in 33 minutes of action. Kris Humphries missed Sunday's game and has not played since late February. Washington has an opportunity to salvage this road trip with a big game Monday against Golden State. Sacramento got its second straight win on Sunday with a terrific shooting performance. The Kings shot 50.6% from the field and 47 percent from beyond the arc. DeMarcus Cousins returned to action Sunday after missing two games with a calf injury. The star big man finished with 20 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in just 23 minutes on the floor. Ben McLemore had a strong outing, scoring all 17 of his points in the second half. The Kings will return to action Tuesday when they host the 76ers.  ",Sacramento,Kings,Washington,Wizards,Golden 1 Center,40,30,24,45,8.0,17.0,40.0,79.0,21.0,23.0,33.0,24.0,16.0,3.0,16.0,32.0,79.0,11.0,16.0,39.0,21.0,13.0,Omri Casspi,2.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,31,Paul Pierce,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,16,Rudy Gay,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,10.0,19.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,32,Nene,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,DeMarcus Cousins,7.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,20.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,22,Marcin Gortat,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Ben McLemore,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,31,Bradley Beal,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,26,Ray McCallum,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,30,John Wall,4.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,33,Nik Stauskas,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Ramon Sessions,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,26,Derrick Williams,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Drew Gooden,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Jason Thompson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Kevin Seraphin,4.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Andre Miller,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Rasual Butler,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,20,Reggie Evans,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Otto Porter Jr.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5

												The Detroit Pistons (26-44) defeated the Boston Celtics (30-39) 105-97 in overtime on Sunday in Boston. A short shot by Reggie Jackson tied the game at 88 with just under a minute remaining and neither team was able to score after that. The Pistons then opened up the period on a 7-0 run and the Celtics were unable to recover after that, as Detroit went onto win 17-9 in overtime.The Pistons were led by another huge double-double from Andre Drummond, who posted 18 points on 8-of-17 shooting, 22 rebounds and four blocks in 40 minutes. It was the 21-year-old's first double-double in three games, but his sixth in the month of March.Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also had a huge game, scoring 27 points on 10-of-20 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 44 minutes. Also in the backcourt, Jackson recorded his fourth straight double-double and nearly his second triple-double in three games, posting 17 points on 5-of-13 shooting, 11 assists and nine rebounds in 37 minutes. Greg Monroe sat out for the fourth straight game with a knee injury, and Anthony Tolliver took his place in the starting lineup, scoring zero points in 25 minutes.The wins gives the Pistons their second in a row, but the team still remains far on the outside looking into the Eastern Conference playoff race, sitting 4.5 games behind the Celtics for the eighth and final playoff spot.All five Celtics starters scored in double figures, but that just was not enough. They were lead by Evan Turner, who posted 23 points on 10-of-21 shooting, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals. Jae Crowder was next up, scoring 19 points on 7-of-16 shooting and seven rebounds in 45 minutes. Marcus Smart served his one-game suspension and Avery Bradley took over the starting point guard duties as a result, but he had just 10 points on 3-of-10 shooting, four assists and four rebounds in 38 minutes. Brandon Bass (13) and Tyler Zeller (10) round out the starters in double figures while Jonas Jerebko scored 10 points in 21 minutes off the bench.The loss was a costly one for the Celtics, as the loss brings them into a tie for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference with the Pacers and Hornets. While they do hold the tiebreaker, Boston is now playing down the final stretch of the season where every game is crucial.Up next, the Pistons will head home Tuesday to take on the Raptors, while Boston will travel to Brooklyn and play the Nets on Monday. 											",Boston,Celtics,Detroit,Pistons,TD Garden,26,44,30,39,7.0,25.0,37.0,101.0,13.0,17.0,58.0,24.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Jae Crowder,7.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,16.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,44,Caron Butler,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,28,Brandon Bass,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,34,Anthony Tolliver,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,24,Tyler Zeller,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Andre Drummond,22.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,18.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40,Avery Bradley,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,37,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,27.0,10.0,20.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,44,Evan Turner,6.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,23.0,10.0,21.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,38,Reggie Jackson,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,37,Kelly Olynyk,9.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,28,Jodie Meeks,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,33,Gigi Datome,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Spencer Dinwiddie,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,15,Phil Pressey,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Tayshaun Prince,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,29,Jonas Jerebko,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,21,Joel Anthony,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Gerald Wallace,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,John Lucas III,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Denver Nuggets (27-44) ended their road trip on a high note Sunday with an easy 119-100 victory over the Orlando Magic (22-50) at the Amway Center. This game was close in the early going, but Denver broke it open with a 41 point outburst in the second quarter to take a 69-51 lead into halftime. Denver's Danilo Gallinari exploded for 40 points, including going 6-for-13 from beyond the arc as the Nuggets cruised to their 27th victory of the season. Orlando's Elfrid Payton had his triple-double streak halted at two games with a 6 point, eight rebound, and eight assist outing. With Sunday's win, Denver swept the season series over Orlando. Denver had lost three straight on its five game road trip, but was able to salvage a 2-3 mark on the swing with Sunday's convincing victory. Jameer Nelson was a question mark coming into this game as he was dealing with a hip injury, but was able to log 17 minutes on the floor and finish with 15 points and five assists against his former club. The Nuggets will return home to face the 76ers on Wednesday. Orlando came into this game on the heels of Friday's 111-104 victory over Portland that was arguably its best of the season. The Magic were unable to put together a good defensive effort and were blown out on their home court against a struggling Nuggets club. Andrew Nicholson was thrust into the starting lineup with Channing Frye sidelined and performed ably, finishing with 13 points and six rebounds. Tobias Harris missed his third straight game Sunday as he continues to deal with an ailing ankle, but he is close to a return. The Magic will have two days off before returning to action Wednesday against the Hawks.  											",Orlando,Magic,Denver,Nuggets,Amway Center,27,44,22,50,4.0,17.0,41.0,85.0,14.0,17.0,40.0,26.0,18.0,12.0,27.0,40.0,87.0,22.0,28.0,44.0,28.0,11.0,Maurice Harkless,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18,Danilo Gallinari,7.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,40.0,12.0,21.0,6.0,13.0,1.0,33,Andrew Nicholson,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,21,Kenneth Faried,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Nikola Vucevic,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,9.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,Jusuf Nurkic,6.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,11.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Victor Oladipo,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,35,Wilson Chandler,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,24,Elfrid Payton,8.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,35,Ty Lawson,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Aaron Gordon,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,17,Jameer Nelson,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,16,Luke Ridnour,1.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,24,JJ Hickson,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Willie Green,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,28,Will Barton,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,25,Kyle O'Quinn,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Darrell Arthur,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Ben Gordon,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,14,Erick Green,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,20

												The Charlotte Hornets (30-38) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (15-55) 109-98 on Sunday in Minneapolis. The Hornets used a dominating second half to pull away and were led by Mo Williams off the bench. Against his old team, Williams scored 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting to go along with four rebounds and four assists in 29 minutes as a reserve. Williams has been moved to the bench since Kemba Walker returned from injury, but it is clear that he remains a key contributor for the Hornets even when coming off the bench.Al Jefferson posted a double-double of 18 points on 9-of-20 shooting and 11 rebounds in 33 minutes. Michael Kidd-Gilcrhist came close to a double-double of his own, recording 18 points on 8-of-10 shooting to go along with nine rebounds. Kemba Walker was effective on both ends of the floor, as he had 16 points on 4-of-11 shooting, 8 assists and six steals in 34 minutes. Gerald Henderson scored 17 points and rounds out the five Hornets who scored in double figures.The win was a big one for the Hornets, as with it and the Celtics' loss, Charlotte now has a hold on the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, but only by a half-game. The Timberwolves may have reached the lowest point of their very low season, as they only had eight active players for Sunday's matchup with the likes of Kevin Garnett (knee), Ricky Rubio (ankle) and Nikola Pekovic (ankle) all out. However, although it was not enough, seven of those eight players scored in double figures. Gorgui Dieng led the team in scoring, putting up 16 points on 5-of-8 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 36 minutes. Kevin Martin struggled with his shot, but still managed 15 points on 7-of-19 shooting, nine assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes. Gary Neal also left the game with a sprained left ankle and did not return.Up next, the Hornets will travel to Chicago Monday to take on the Bulls, while the Timberwolves will head to Utah Monday and play the Jazz.

												The Phoenix Suns (38-33) edged out the Dallas Mavericks (44-27), 98-92, on Sunday at the US Airways Center to keep their faint playoff hopes alive.Phoenix led by as many as 17, but that comfortable lead quickly turned into a six point deficit midway through the fourth. With their playoff chances starting to dwindle, the Suns desperately needed a home win Sunday. Eric Bledsoe canned a deep three to cut Dallas' lead to one. From there,the Suns outscored the Mavericks 13-6 over the last four minutes to seal the win. Dallas went 2-13 from the floor in the last 7:13 as it faltered to its second straight loss. The Suns clinched the season series with their third win over the Mavericks this season. They will meet for the final time in the regular season on April 8th. Dallas needed a win to keep pace with San Antonio, who got a big win in Atlanta earlier in the day.  J.J Barea was out for this game with a sprained ankle and Devin Harris had to exit the game due to illness, leaving Raymond Felton as the lone reserve point guard for Dallas. Felton hit a three to start the fourth but only logged five minutes for the whole game. Monta Ellis was a frigid 4-for-22  from the field and finished with 11 points. The Mavericks have a chance to regain some ground this week with two games against the Spurs, who lead them by a game in the race for the West's sixth seed. Phoenix moved ahead of New Orleans in the standings Sunday with a win and a Pelicans loss. However, the Suns still trail the streaking Thunder by 2.5 games for the West's final playoff spot.  Brandon Knight sat out again Sunday, but the club hopes to have him back for Phoenix's next game, which will be Wednesday against Sacramento.

												In a battle of two of the NBA's worst teams, the Los Angeles Lakers (18-50) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (17-53) 101-87 on Sunday in Los Angeles. The Lakers were led by an incredible performance from Jeremy Lin, who posted 29 points on 10-of-16 shooting, five rebounds and five assists in 29 minutes off the bench. He carried the team to victory, as for the most part, the other Lakers were unimpressive. Jordan Hill scored 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting and grabbed eight rebounds, while Wayne Ellington, Wesley Johnson and Jabari Brown each scored 10 to round out the five Los Angeles players in double figures. The 76ers could not get anything going as they continue, along with the Lakers, to boast one of the worst records in the NBA. Despite recording 21 assists to just nine eight turnovers, the team shot a poor 36.5 percent from the field. Only one starter scored in double figures, and that was Luc Richard Mbah a Moute with 13 points on 5-of-12 shooting in 29 minutes.Thomas Robinson played well off the bench, recording 14 points on 7-of-8 shooting to go along with 8 rebounds in just 16 minutes of play. Robinson has been very productive in limited minutes this season, and it is likely he sees an increase in minutes as the final stretch of the season hits. Robert Covington (11) and Hollis Thompson (10) round out the four Philadelphia players who scored in double figures. Up next, the Lakers will head to Oklahoma City Tuesday to take on the streaking Thunder, while the 76ers will travel to Sacramento and play the Kings on Tuesday. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Philadelphia,76ers,Staples Center,17,53,18,50,5.0,14.0,39.0,81.0,18.0,22.0,52.0,21.0,13.0,7.0,25.0,28.0,82.0,14.0,21.0,36.0,21.0,7.0,Wesley Johnson,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,27,JaKarr Sampson,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Jordan Hill,8.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Luc Mbah a Moute,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,29,Tarik Black,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Nerlens Noel,7.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Wayne Ellington,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,19,Jason Richardson,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,20,Jordan Clarkson,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,23,Ish Smith,2.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,28,Carlos Boozer,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Jerami Grant,3.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,21,Jeremy Lin,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,29.0,10.0,16.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,28,Robert Covington,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,25,Jabari Brown,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,24,Isaiah Canaan,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,12.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,21,Ed Davis,11.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Thomas Robinson,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Ryan Kelly,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,22,Furkan Aldemir,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15

												One night after engaging in a triple-overtime game that lasted just under three hours, the Brooklyn Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers in regulation, 123-111. The Nets were the sixth team to win a game the second night of a back-to-back after playing multiple overtimes the night before. Rodney Stuckey exited early due to a sore left calf, playing just 13 minutes in the first half. The Nets pulled to within one game of the eight seed in the Eastern Conference with their second straight win. However, they're still behind the Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the standings, both teams on the outside looking in. As a team, the Nets shot 61 percent and scored 123 points one night after scoring 129 points in triple-overtime. Brook Lopez has hit a new gear this month, both on the defensive end and boards. He scored 26 points, grabbed four rebounds, and blocked four shots in 31 minutes. Bojan Bogdanovic supplied 21 points off the bench for the second time in four games.The Pacers lost their fifth straight game, falling half a game behind the Boston Celtics for the final spot in the playoffs. They shot 50 percent from the field but only made 8-of-23 three-pointers and allowed a season-high 123 points. The loss snapped a streak of five straight wins over the Nets. Paul George didn’t play, but his return appears imminent. George Hill fouled out but not before providing 18 points, nine assists and four rebounds in 32 minutes. Six Pacers, including all the starters, scored in double figures. David West scored 13 points and played 28 minutes after exiting Friday’s game early due to an illness.The Nets take on the eight seeded Boston Celtics on Monday in a battle that will have heavy playoff implications. The Pacers conclude a two-game homestand when they play the Houston Rockets on Monday.

												The Detroit Pistons (25-44) had a lights-out shooting performance in the second half to rout the Chicago Bulls (42-29), 107-91, on Saturday at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The Pistons trailed by as many as 19 midway through the third quarter before starting a furious comeback. Performances from role players like Caron Butler, Joel Anthony, Tayshaun Prince, and Jodie Meeks helped make the difference. In the end, Detroit outscored Chicago 54-19 from the 6:41 mark in the third quarter. Chicago was coming off a convincing 108-92 win over Toronto on Friday, but was unable to maintain that momentum through Saturday's contest. Pau Gasol led the way for Chicago with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Mike Dunleavy and Nikola Mirotic struggled from beyond the arc, combining for 1-for-10 from three point range. The Bulls are hopeful that Jimmy Butler, who is out with an elbow injury, can return within a week. Chicago will return to action Monday at home against Charlotte. Detroit has now notched two wins over playoff teams this week after defeating Memphis on Tuesday and Chicago on Saturday. Reggie Jackson had another big outing with 22 points and 11 assists over 28 minutes. The Pistons outscored the Bulls in the paint 50-36 and were only out-rebounded by one despite Greg Monroe missing the game with a knee injury. Detroit will finish its back-to-back set Sunday against Boston. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Chicago,Bulls,Little Caesars Arena,42,29,25,44,11.0,26.0,44.0,90.0,8.0,10.0,44.0,28.0,4.0,6.0,21.0,33.0,77.0,19.0,24.0,45.0,21.0,11.0,Caron Butler,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,29,Mike Dunleavy,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,5.0,3.0,33,Anthony Tolliver,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,21,Joakim Noah,13.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,29,Andre Drummond,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Pau Gasol,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,10.0,16.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,31,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,38,Tony Snell,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,36,Reggie Jackson,3.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,27,Aaron Brooks,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,36,Jodie Meeks,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,21,Nikola Mirotic,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,23,Spencer Dinwiddie,3.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,20,Taj Gibson,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Tayshaun Prince,10.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Kirk Hinrich,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25,Joel Anthony,6.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,E'Twaun Moore,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Cartier Martin,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5,Nazr Mohammed,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

												The Phoenix Suns (37-33) got a big win on the road Saturday against the Houston Rockets (46-23) by a score of 117-102. Phoenix held off a Houston run in the fourth quarter where the Rockets cut the Suns lead to five with five minutes to go. A big key in this game was Phoenix's ability to keep James Harden in check. Harden finished with 16 points on 5-of-19 shooting and more importantly, the Suns kept Harden off the free throw line, holding him to just five free throw attempts. Phoenix's Eric Bledsoe had a big game as well with 34 points to help keep the Suns' playoff hopes alive. Phoenix's win helps it pick up a half game on New Orleans and Oklahoma City in the race for the final playoff spot in the West. Alex Len returned to the lineup after missing time due to an ankle injury, but only played 18 minutes. Brandan Wright and P.J Tucker had big outings as Wright pulled down nine rebounds and blocked two shots while Tucker had 19 points and had a solid game defensively. The Suns will have another chance to get a win against a playoff team on Sunday when they take on the Mavericks. Houston had its three game winning streak snapped Saturday despite shooting 47 percent from the floor. Trevor Ariza was able to play despite an illness and posted a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Josh Smith turned his ankle mid way through the fourth quarter and did not return to action. The Rockets will travel to Indiana to take on the Pacers on Monday. 											",Houston,Rockets,Phoenix,Suns,Toyota Center,37,33,46,23,10.0,34.0,41.0,87.0,10.0,12.0,36.0,28.0,17.0,8.0,15.0,46.0,92.0,17.0,24.0,49.0,20.0,14.0,Trevor Ariza,12.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,36,Marcus Morris Sr.,10.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,35,Donatas Motiejunas,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,38,Markieff Morris,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,30,Joey Dorsey,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Alex Len,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,James Harden,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,5.0,19.0,1.0,8.0,5.0,32,P.J.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (49-21) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (44-24), 97-86. It marks the Blazers’ fourth straight loss. The Grizzlies swept the season series for the first time in their history. LaMarcus Aldridge and Nicolas Batum didn’t play in the second half, sidelined by a left hand and lower back injury respectively. Dorell Wright and Meyers Leonard started in their place.Courtney Lee was unable to play due to a right-hand sprain. Jeff Green replaced him in the starting lineup and supplied a team-high 23 points in 40 minutes. Tony Allen tied his career-high with 11 rebounds and recorded six steals. All five starters scored in double figures, but Marc Gasol recorded the only team block. The Grizzlies are now seven games behind the Golden State Warriors for the number one seed in the Western Conference and two and a half games ahead of the Houston Rockets. They have 12 games left to cement their stake as the two seed.The Blazers are one game ahead of the Clippers in the loss column, clinging to the four seed in the Western Conference. If Aldridge aggravated his thumb injury and Batum needs to miss substantial time, the Blazers are in jeopardy of falling to the seven seed by the end of next week. They’re currently one game ahead of the six seeded San Antonio Spurs and seven seeded Dallas Mavericks. They play four games in five nights this week and engage in four back-to-backs the rest of the season. Damian Lillard scored a game-high 27 points, made all nine free throws, and dished out seven assists in 39 minutes. Off the bench, C.J. McCollum scored 13 points and Dorell Wright chipped in 10 points.

												The Golden State Warriors (56-13) won their third game in four nights Saturday with a 106-91 win over the Utah Jazz (31-38) at the Oracle Arena. Golden State accomplished a rare feat Saturday, even by its lofty standards. The Warriors were the first team to score 100 points on the Jazz in nearly a month, a span of 12 games. Stephen Curry scored a game-high 24 points and Leandro Barbosa continued his offensive surge with 19 points (8-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt) off the bench. With the victory, Golden State won the season series against Utah  3-1. Utah has now dropped two of its last three after going 8-1 to begin March. Granted, both losses came against playoff opponents (Washington and Golden State) and were competitive games overall. Rudy Gobert had a quiet outing on the boards by his standards, pulling down nine rebounds. This was his second straight game without double-digit rebounds after reaching that mark in his previous ten outings. Derrick Favors had a solid outing with 21 points and 11 rebounds to lead the team in both categories and Trey Burke scored 20 off the bench. The Jazz will return home to face the Timberwolves on Monday. Golden State continued its dominance at home Saturday, improving its record at the Oracle Arena to 33-2. The Warriors now have a seven and a half game lead over Memphis for the top spot in the Western conference with just 13 games remaining. Golden State had three starters and two bench players score in double figures Saturday, illustrating its scoring depth. The Warriors will host the Wizards on Monday before kicking off a stretch of seven road games in their next eight contests. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Utah,Jazz,Chase Center,31,38,56,13,8.0,18.0,38.0,78.0,22.0,26.0,37.0,25.0,10.0,10.0,22.0,32.0,73.0,17.0,21.0,35.0,19.0,15.0,Harrison Barnes,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,28,Gordon Hayward,3.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,33,Draymond Green,6.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,32,Derrick Favors,11.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,34,Andrew Bogut,8.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Rudy Gobert,9.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Justin Holiday,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,18,Rodney Hood,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,9.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,31,Stephen Curry,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,18.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,32,Dante Exum,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,17,Andre Iguodala,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,30,Joe Ingles,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,13,Leandro Barbosa,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,27,Trevor Booker,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Marreese Speights,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Trey Burke,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,16.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,28,Shaun Livingston,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Elijah Millsap,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,20,Festus Ezeli,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Jack Cooley,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2

												The Orlando Magic (22-49) defeated the Portland Trailblazers (44-23) 111-104 on Friday in Orlando. The win ended a six-game losing streak for the Magic and were led to the upset victory by Elfrid Payton, who recorded his second consecutive triple-double, putting up 22 points on 10-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals in 36 minutes. Now, in his previous two games, Payton has totaled 35 points, 20 rebounds and 22 assists.Nikola Vucevic and Victor Oladipo also each scored the team-high 22 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. However, they shot a sub-par 17-45 from the field. The shooting struggles have been apparent for Oladipo as of late, as in his last two games he has shot just 14-43 from the field and 2-of-8 from long range. Channing Frye was the only other Orlando starter to score in double figures with 10 points in 31 minutes, while Ben Gordon contributed a solid 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench.In injury news, Tobias Harris sat out his second consecutive game with a sprained ankle.LaMarcus Aldridge scored a game-high 36 points in the losing effort for the Trail Blazers on 12-of-24 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds in 36 minutes. This was Aldridge's second straight game with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds and his fourth straight double-double. From there, there was a big drop off in Portland production, as Damian Lillard scored 18 points on 6-of-15 shooting and also recorded four rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. Robin Lopez was the only other Trail Blazers starter to score in double figures, putting up 10 points in 26 minutes. Off the bench, C.J. McCollum played 19 minutes and scored 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting in that span. The loss gives Portland a three game win streak, and they currently find themselves in fourth place in the Western Conference and 1.5 games behind the Houston Rockets for third. They also hold just a one-game lead over the Clippers and Mavericks for fifth and sixth place.Up next, the Magic will stay home and go up against the Nuggets, while Portland will travel to Memphis Saturday to take on the Grizzlies in a matchup with big-time playoff implications. 											",Orlando,Magic,Portland,Trail Blazers,Amway Center,44,23,22,49,5.0,12.0,43.0,94.0,20.0,24.0,50.0,22.0,7.0,7.0,24.0,37.0,77.0,21.0,24.0,43.0,12.0,13.0,Maurice Harkless,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,28,Nicolas Batum,11.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,34,Channing Frye,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,30,LaMarcus Aldridge,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,31.0,12.0,24.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,35,Nikola Vucevic,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,10.0,22.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,31,Robin Lopez,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Victor Oladipo,8.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,23.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,35,Arron Afflalo,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,32,Elfrid Payton,10.0,10.0,4.0,0.0,22.0,10.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,Damian Lillard,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,36,Ben Gordon,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Chris Kaman,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,Andrew Nicholson,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18,CJ McCollum,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,19,Kyle O'Quinn,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13,Steve Blake,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Luke Ridnour,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,10,Dorell Wright,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4,Aaron Gordon,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Meyers Leonard,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,16

												The Nets (28-39) defeated the Bucks (34-35) 129-127 on Friday.The game was a thriller and needed three overtimes to claim a victor. With a minute and 19 seconds left in regulation, Brooklyn's Joe Johnson hit a three-pointer that tied the game at 101 and sent the contest into its first overtime. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was the hero in the first overtime, tying the game at 111 with an 8-foot jumper with 15 seconds on the clock. Joe Johnson came up big from three-point range once again in the second overtime, tying the game at 117 with 18 seconds on the clock. After a hard-fought third overtime, the Nets were able to pull away in the end. The Bucks shared the ball on Friday. Ersan Ilyasova had 20 points (8-19, 4-6 3Pt), Antetokounmpo had 23 (7-19 FG), Zaza Pachulia had 22 (9-16 FG) and Michael Carter-Williams had 19 (7-26 FG, 0-1 3Pt). Brook Lopez led the Nets in scoring with 32 points (13-20 FG), to go with 18 rebounds, two assists and five blocks. Thaddeus Young contributed 24 points (8-20 FG, 3-5 3Pt), five rebounds, three assists and one steal.March has been a bad month for the Bucks. They've lost eight of their last ten. The Bucks have struggled offensively since dealing Brandon Knight to the Suns. They're shooting 42.7 percent from the field in his absence, down from 45.8 percent on the season. Recent injuries have exacerbated the situation. Jared Dudley (back) and O.J. Mayo (hamstring) were out against the Nets. Both have lingering injuries, and there's no definite timetable for their return. The Nets are also struggling. They've lost six of their last ten games. On Wednesday, they were blown out by the Cavaliers 117-92. The Bucks are currently sixth in the Eastern Conference, six games behind fifth-place Washington. The Nets are battling for a playoff spot, 1.5 games out of eighth place in the East, so Friday's game was a much-needed victory.The Bucks lead the season series 2-1.

												The Sacramento Kings (23-45), the league’s worst defense since the All-Star break, defeated the Charlotte Hornets (29-38), 101-91. DeMarcus Cousins warmed up prior to the game, but ultimately decided not to play for the second straight game with an ailing calf.Rudy Gay nearly accounted for a third of the team’s points, scoring 33 to go with nine rebounds, four assists, two steals and two three-pointers in 37 minutes. Omri Casspi replaced Ryan Hollins in the starting lineup, compiling 10 points, five rebounds, two assists and one three-pointer in 33 minutes. Reggie Evans grabbed 16 rebounds in 21 minutes, helping the Kings end a four-game losing streak. Derrick Williams threw down a monster dunk on Bismack Biyombo, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes off the bench.The Hornets fell half a game behind the Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers for the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoff push, losing their third straight game. Kemba Walker was inserted into the starting lineup after coming off the bench the previous four games. Walker and the man he replaced, Mo Williams, were each assessed a technical foul. Even worse, Williams missed his first 11 shots and finished 3-of-15 from the field for nine points. Walker scored 18 points and accumulated four steals in 31 minutes. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist blocked a shot for the seventh straight game.The Kings play their fourth straight home game when they face the Washington Wizards on Sunday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (45-26) defeated the Indiana Pacers (30-37) 95-92 on Friday in Cleveland. Cleveland had lost the last two matchups with Indiana this season, but this time around was different, as a LeBron James jumper put the Cavaliers up one with just over two minutes to go, and the Pacers were unable to score from that point on. All five Cleveland starters scored in double figures with James leading the way, putting up a game-high 29 points on 13-of-26 shooting, seven rebounds and five assists in 39 minutes.Kevin Love recorded a double-double in 39 minutes of play, putting up 11 points on just 3-of-9 shooting and 13 rebounds. Kyrie Irving (13), Timofey Mozgov (12) and J.R. Smith (11) round out the Cavaliers starters who scored in double figures, while Matthew Dellavedova recorded 11 points and five assists in 17 minutes off the bench.The win puts Cleveland comfortably in second place in the Eastern Conference playoff race, as they hold a 2.5-game lead over the Raptors, but they are still 9.5 games behind Atlanta for first place. The Pacers were lead by George Hill, who scored a team-high 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting in 33 minutes. Roy Hibbert was not too far behind, scoring 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 35 minutes. This was the first time since the beginning of January where Hibbert scored 20-plus points. Louis Scola also added a double-double for Indiana, scoring 14 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in 31 minutes off the bench.No other Indiana players scored in double figures, and Rodney Stuckey, who usually provides a scoring spark off the bench for the Pacers, scored just six points on 2-of-11 shooting in 25 minutes. David West (illness) left Friday's game after playing just 12 minutes and did not return to action.  The loss is Indiana's fourth in a row and they currently are on the outside of the playoff race in the East looking in, as they stand a half game behind the Boston Celtics for the final spot. Up next, the Cavaliers will head to Milwaukee Sunday to take on the Bucks, while the Pacers will play the Nets at home on Saturday. 											",Miami,Heat,Denver,Nuggets,AmericanAirlines Arena,26,44,32,36,7.0,16.0,43.0,81.0,15.0,19.0,43.0,23.0,15.0,7.0,27.0,37.0,79.0,10.0,19.0,35.0,21.0,16.0,Luol Deng,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,28,Wilson Chandler,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,36,Udonis Haslem,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,13,Kenneth Faried,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,20.0,10.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Hassan Whiteside,10.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Jusuf Nurkic,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,30,Dwyane Wade,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,30,Randy Foye,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,12.0,4.0,11.0,3.0,30,Goran Dragic,8.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,9.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,34,Ty Lawson,5.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,38,Michael Beasley,8.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,13.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,34,JJ Hickson,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,14,Mario Chalmers,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Will Barton,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,17,Chris Andersen,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Darrell Arthur,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,13,Henry Walker,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,19,Erick Green,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,11,Tyler Johnson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Gary Harris,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,12

Michael Beasley played 34 minutes off the bench and nearly totaled a triple-double with nine points, eight rebounds, seven assists, three steals, one block and one three-pointer. Recently acquired Goran Dragic nearly matched Beasley’s night, scoring 18 points, grabbing eight rebounds, dishing five assists, snatching two steals and blocking one shot in a team-high 35 minutes. Dwyane Wade, the leading 4th quarter scorer at 7.2 per, was held to four points in the final period, finishing with 22 points overall. Danilo Gallinari sat the second game of a back-to-back. Jusuf Nurkic claimed Gallinari’s spot in the starting lineup, recording 16 points, seven rebounds, two steals and one block in 30 minutes.

												The Chicago Bulls (42-28) defeated the Toronto Raptors (41-28) 108-92 on Friday in Chicago. Nikola Mirotic continues to act as the best player on this Bulls team as of late, as Friday night he scored a game-high 29 points on 11-of-21 shooting, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked four shots in 32 minutes. Injuries have plagued Chicago, and it has been Mirotic's play that has allowed the Bulls to continue winning regardless. Mike Dunleavy scored 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting in 29 minutes and has also stepped up his game as of late, scoring 42 points in his last two outings. Joakim Noah was just two points shy of a triple-double, recording eight points on 4-of-7 shooting, 14 assists and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. Paul Gasol put up 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 28 minutes, while Aaron Brooks had 11 points, six rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes. Taj Gibson returned to the rotation Friday after missing the previous 10 games with an ankle injury. He played only 10 minutes and scored six points. Jimmy Butler (elbow) is practicing and is set to return soon, while Derrick Rose (knee) remains out but is on schedule in his recovery. As a team, the Bulls shot an impressive 53.2 percent from the field and the win pushes them ahead of Toronto for third place in the Eastern Conference, and they stand 2.5 games behind the Cavaliers for second.DeMar Derozan lead the way for the Raptors in the losing effort, recording 27 points on 8-of-14 shooting, seven rebounds and three assists in 37 minutes. Unfortunately for Toronto, the rest of the team was unable to contribute much more, as Greivis Vasquez served as the only other starter who scored in double figures, putting up 11 points, six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes. Vasquez got the start after Kyle Lowry was ruled out prior to the game with a back injury.Patrick Patterson scored a solid 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting in 25 minutes off the bench, but as a team, the Raptors shot a poor 38 percent from the field. The loss moves them back into fourth place in the East, where they hold just a half-game lead over the Wizards for fifth. Up next, the Bulls will travel to Detroit Saturday to take on the Pistons, while Toronto will play the Knicks at home on Sunday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Atlanta,Hawks,Chesapeake Energy Arena,53,16,39,30,13.0,30.0,42.0,83.0,24.0,26.0,44.0,26.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Dion Waiters,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,26.0,11.0,18.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,37,DeMarre Carroll,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,33,Mitch McGary,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,17,Paul Millsap,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,19.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,37,Steven Adams,16.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Al Horford,11.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Andre Roberson,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,17,Kent Bazemore,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,27,Russell Westbrook,10.0,14.0,1.0,0.0,36.0,8.0,24.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,44,Jeff Teague,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,31,Nick Collison,5.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,13.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Dennis Schroder,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,31,Anthony Morrow,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,10.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,31,Pero Antic,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,19,Steve Novak,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Shelvin Mack,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,20,D.J.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (48-21) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (44-26) 112-101 on Friday in Dallas. Marc Gasol, who has really picked up his game as of late, lead the way for the Grizzlies, recording a triple-double of 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. In his last four games, Gasol has been productive in multiple facets, averaging 14.5 points, 9.0 points and 4.5 assists. Zach Randolph lead the team in scoring Friday, putting up 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting to go along with five assists and four rebounds. Mike Conley had 14 points on 4-of-9 shooting and three assists in 32 minutes, while Tony Allen recorded 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting and seven rebounds in 32 minutes as a starter. Jeff Green came off the bench for Memphis and scored 15 points on 5-of-11 shooting in 27 minutes. Beno Udrih (12) and Vince Carter (11) round out the seven Grizzlies who scored in double figures. The victory gives the Grizzlies a 1.5-game lead over Houston for second place in the Western Conference, although they still trail the first-place Warriors by seven games.  Devin Harris lead the way for the Mavericks, scoring 16 points on 5-of-6 shooting in 21 minutes off the bench. Dirk Nowitzki was close behind and was only able to record 16 points on a poor 4-of-14 shooting.Tyson Chandler fell just two points shy of a double-double, putting up nine points on 4-of-4 shooting and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes. Chandler Parsons (12), Monta Ellis (12), Charlie Villanueva (12) and Rajon Rondo (10) round out the six Mavericks who scored in double figures. As a team, Dallas recorded just 14 assists to 17 turnovers, and the loss moves them into seventh place in the West, but they still are just 1.5 games behind the fourth-place Trail Blazers.Up next, the Grizzlies will head home Saturday and take on the Trail Blazers, while the Mavericks will head to Phoenix on Sunday and play the Suns. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Boston,Celtics,AT&T Center,30,38,43,25,5.0,22.0,38.0,80.0,19.0,21.0,43.0,31.0,13.0,5.0,20.0,32.0,83.0,14.0,19.0,40.0,18.0,15.0,Kawhi Leonard,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,31,Evan Turner,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,32,Tim Duncan,6.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Brandon Bass,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Tiago Splitter,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Tyler Zeller,9.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Danny Green,8.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,10.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,33,Avery Bradley,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,28,Tony Parker,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,26,Marcus Smart,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,22,Boris Diaw,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,26,Kelly Olynyk,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Marco Belinelli,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,23,Jae Crowder,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,31,Aron Baynes,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Phil Pressey,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Patty Mills,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,19,Jonas Jerebko,12.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,26,Reggie Williams,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,Gigi Datome,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,6

												The San Antonio Spurs (43-25) are hitting their stride at the right time, winning for the ninth time in 11 games in their defeat of the Boston Celtics (30-38), 101-89. Marcus Smart was assessed a flagrant foul 2 and ejected for punching Matt Bonner. He's subject to additional discipline for striking Bonner in the groin area.Kawhi Leonard will not stop pilfering unsuspecting offensive players, adding three steals to keep his yearly average at 2.2 per game, tied with Russell Westbrook for most in the league. Aron Baynes returned to the rotation after missing two games with a rib contusion. He chipped in four points and five rebounds as a reserve. Tim Duncan was rested the final 17 minutes as the Spurs pulled away. He ended with 10 points, six rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block in 20 minutes. Even though Danny Green shot 2-of-10 from the field, he added 10 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks. He’s the only two players averaging at least one steal, one block, and two three-pointers per game.The Celtics lost their second straight contest, and before the night’s over, they could fall a half game out of the playoff format if the Charlotte Hornets defeat the Sacramento Kings. Jae Crowder replaced Tyler Zeller in the second half starting lineup, accumulating 14 points on 5-of-14 shooting in 32 minutes. Before getting tossed, Marcus Smart scored 10 points and notched four assists in 23 minutes. Off the bench, Jonas Jerebko grabbed a team-high 12 rebounds. Brandon Bass and Kelly Olynyk didn’t participate in the fourth quarter with the Spurs up 21 points entering the final period.The Spurs launch a two-game road trip Sunday against the Atlanta Hawks. The Celtics host the Detroit Pistons on Sunday before turning around for another road game.

												The Golden State Warriors (55-13) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (37-32) 112-96 on Friday in Oakland. The Warriors improved to a league-best 32-2 at home and beat up on a injury-depleted Pelicans squad. For the second outing in a row, Harrison Barnes led the way for Golden State, scoring 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting in just 20 minutes. In his last two games, Barnes has totaled an incredibly efficient 47 points in 48 minutes of play. Stephen Curry struggled shooting the ball, going just 4-of-17 from the field and 2-of-10 from three, but was still able to total 16 points and 11 assists in 27 minutes. No other starters for the Warriors scored in double figures, but Marreese Speights (13), Leandro Barbosa (12) and Andre Iguodala (10) all scored in double figures off the bench. Klay Thompson continues to be out with an ankle injury, but Golden State hasn't skipped a beat without him as they extend their lead in the Western Conference playoff race to 7.5 games. The Pelicans struggled Friday night as they were plagued with injuries in the frontcourt. Both Anthony Davis (ankle) and Omer Asik (calf) were ruled out prior to the game and are to be considered questionable going forward. As a result, Alexis Anjinca was put into the starting lineup and posted 15 points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes. Norris Cole lead the team in scoring, recording 16 points, five rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. Cole played a bulk of the minutes at point guard as a result of Tyreke Evans still dealing with soreness in his ankle. Evans played just 15 minutes and had only two points to go with five rebounds and four assists. Quincy Pondexter (15), Jeff Withey (14) and Jimmer Fredette (10) round out the New Orleans players who scored in double figures. This was a costly loss for the Pelicans, as it pushes them two games behind the Thunder for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West with just 13 games remaining in the regular season.Up next, the Warriors will play the Jazz Saturday at home, while New Orleans will travel to Los Angeles Sunday to take on the Clippers. 											",Golden State,Warriors,New Orleans,Pelicans,Chase Center,37,32,55,13,5.0,19.0,39.0,80.0,16.0,17.0,31.0,27.0,10.0,11.0,22.0,33.0,77.0,19.0,22.0,42.0,22.0,20.0,Harrison Barnes,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19,Quincy Pondexter,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,26,Draymond Green,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,27,Dante Cunningham,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Andrew Bogut,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Alexis Ajinca,8.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Justin Holiday,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,21,Eric Gordon,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,23,Stephen Curry,2.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,17.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,27,Tyreke Evans,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,14,Leandro Barbosa,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23,Jeff Withey,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Andre Iguodala,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,23,Norris Cole,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,36,Marreese Speights,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,13.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,16,Jimmer Fredette,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,23,Shaun Livingston,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,21,Luke Babbitt,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,24,James Michael McAdoo,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Elliot Williams,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12

												The New York Knicks (14-54) fell to the Minnesota Timberwolves (15-53), 95-92, in overtime on Thursday at Madison Square Garden. The records of these two teams entering this contest belies how entertaining it was. The fourth quarter featured ties or lead changes on seemingly every possession and neither team ever led by more than two points in the period. Alexey Shved hit two clutch free throws late in the game to send it to overtime. Zach LaVine's six points in overtime made the difference, however, as the Timberwolves were able to edge out the Knicks. Minnesota was playing the second half of a back-to-back Thursday and was left with just eight healthy bodies at its disposal, including a D-League callup. Sean Kilpatrick was signed to a 10-day contract Thursday and logged 10 minutes in this game as Kevin Garnett, Justin Hamilton, Gary Neal, Ricky Rubio, and Nikola Pekovic were not in uniform. Chase Budinger played 43 minutes off the bench and amassed 10 points, six rebounds, and four steals. Zach LaVine got the start at point guard and finished with 20 points, seven rebounds, and four assists over 37 minutes. The Timberwolves will have a few days off to get healthy before returning to action Sunday against Charlotte. New York fell just shy of notching its second straight overtime victory this week. Alexey Shved and Langston Galloway led the way with 20 and 21 points respectively. The Knicks have a quick turnaround after this game with a matchup in Philadelphia on the slate for Friday. 											",New York,Knicks,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Madison Square Garden,15,53,14,54,4.0,20.0,40.0,97.0,8.0,10.0,49.0,22.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,Lou Amundson,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Andrew Wiggins,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,20.0,4.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,42,Lance Thomas,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,31,Adreian Payne,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Andrea Bargnani,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,33,Gorgui Dieng,11.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,19.0,9.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,48,Langston Galloway,7.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,20.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,40,Kevin Martin,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,26.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,43,Alexey Shved,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,7.0,21.0,0.0,7.0,4.0,42,Zach LaVine,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,36,Jason Smith,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,21,Chase Budinger,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,43,Shane Larkin,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,24,Lorenzo Brown,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,25,Travis Wear,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Sean Kilpatrick,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,Cole Aldrich,7.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Anthony Bennett,,,,,,,,,,,,Quincy Acy,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,14,Kevin Garnett,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Houston Rockets (46-22) defeated the Denver Nuggets (26-43) 118-108 on Thursday at the Toyota Center. James Harden reminded everyone why he's an MVP candidate Thursday with his seventh outing of 40 or more points, setting a new career-high with 50 points. Fittingly, he hit two free throws to eclipse his previous career-high. Overall, he was 22-of-25 from the line against the Nuggets. For comparison's sake, the Nuggets were 11-of-19 from the charity stripe in this contest. With Thursday's win, the Rockets completed the season sweep of the Nuggets. Denver had its full complement of players available for this game after resting Ty Lawson, Danilo Gallinari, and Kenneth Faried on Monday. Faried recorded a double-double with 19 points and 12 rebounds and Lawson had a double-double of his own with 12 points and 10 assists. The Nuggets have two games remaining on their five-game road trip, which continues Friday in Miami.Houston has now won three in a row and five of its last seven. Patrick Beverley was able to play through elbow soreness and finished with 10 points and seven assists over 37 minutes. In addition to his 50 points, Harden also pulled down 10 rebounds to notch the double-double. Terrence Jones moved back into the starting lineup for this game, but exited with a rib injury after just nine minutes on the floor and did not return. The Rockets will be idle Friday before hosting the Suns on Saturday.   											",Houston,Rockets,Denver,Nuggets,Toyota Center,26,43,46,22,,,,,,,,,,13.0,36.0,42.0,93.0,11.0,19.0,42.0,23.0,15.0,Trevor Ariza,6.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,13.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,36,Wilson Chandler,6.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,23.0,10.0,17.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,30,Terrence Jones,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Danilo Gallinari,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,5.0,3.0,33,Donatas Motiejunas,9.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,37,Kenneth Faried,12.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,James Harden,10.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,50.0,12.0,27.0,4.0,12.0,4.0,40,Randy Foye,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,19.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,34,Patrick Beverley,2.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,36,Ty Lawson,2.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,38,Corey Brewer,10.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,28,Will Barton,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,18,Josh Smith,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,21,Jameer Nelson,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,17,Pablo Prigioni,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,11,Darrell Arthur,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,Joey Dorsey,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,JJ Hickson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5,Nick Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,Jusuf Nurkic,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11

												The Phoenix Suns (36-33) held off the New Orleans Pelicans (37-31) on Thursday at the US Airways Center by a score of 74-72. Anthony Davis' absence was certainly apparent Thursday after the rising super star was scratched from the lineup with a sprained ankle suffered during the morning shootaround. As a result, Phoenix's Brandan Wright had free reign of the paint all night, finishing with seven blocks and eight rebounds. Omer Asik's departure due to a calf injury didn't help the Pelicans' cause either as the Suns out-rebounded them by 12. It was a sloppy game on the offensive end as well with neither team shooting above 40 percent from the field. The Suns were able to come away with the win in the end after Tyreke Evans' jumper with time running out didn't fall.  These two teams are battling for the final playoff spot in the West and will have a pivotal meeting on April 10 to decide the season series. New Orleans' last two games have been decided by a grand total of three points as they are now a full game behind Oklahoma City in the Western Conference. Asik and Davis weren't the only injured Pelicans on Thursday; Tyreke Evans was noticeably playing through pain in his left ankle, but gritted out 35 minutes of time on the floor. The Pelicans don't have much time to nurse their wounds with a matchup with the Warriors on the slate for Friday. It's unclear whether Anthony Davis or Omer Asik will be available for that contest. Phoenix finished its five-game homestand with a 3-2 mark after getting a big win Thursday. Brandon Knight, Alex Len, and Marcus Thornton were all sidelined with injuries, but Markieff Morriss and Brandan Wright helped the Suns get the win. The Suns will travel to Houston to take on the Rockets on Saturday before kicking off a four-game homestand on Sunday against Dallas. That homestand is critical for the Suns, who will be on the road for seven of its final eight games. 											",Phoenix,Suns,New Orleans,Pelicans,Talking Stick Resort Arena,37,31,36,33,,,,,,,,,,5.0,18.0,31.0,83.0,5.0,10.0,45.0,19.0,9.0,Marcus Morris Sr.,13.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,40,Quincy Pondexter,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,29,Markieff Morris,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,5.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,37,Dante Cunningham,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,35,Brandan Wright,8.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,16.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,37,Omer Asik,14.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,P.J.

												The Utah Jazz (31-37) held off the Los Angeles Lakers (17-50) 80-73 on Thursday at the Staples Center. It was a low-scoring affair in which the Lakers scored 20 points in a quarter just once as the Jazz were able to hold on late. Interestingly, Utah was not only outrebounded by Los Angeles, it was also outscored 46-22 in the paint. Thursday marked the rubber match between these teams with Utah taking the season series 2-1. Utah was playing the second half of a back-to-back  Thursday after taking an 88-84 loss at home to Washington on Wednesday. Rudy Gobert, who had been nothing short of dominant on the glass since moving into the starting lineup, was held to just seven rebounds Thursday. It was the first time since Feb. 27 that Gobert recorded single digit rebounds. Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 22 points. He took a hard fall on a drive late in the fourth but was able to return to action. The Jazz are off Friday before traveling to the Oracle Arena to take on the Warriors. Los Angeles was able to hang with Utah for most of the game, but fell short in the end with another close loss. The Lakers have lost nine of their ten games in March, but none have been by more than seven points. Jordan Clarkson had a solid outing across the board with eight points, five rebounds, and an 8:1 assist:turnover ratio. Jeremy Lin managed to play 22 minutes despite back spasms, but his performance was clearly affected as he finished with just two points on 1-of-8 shooting. The Lakers will return to action Sunday against the 76ers.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (44-26) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (27-39) 117-92 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.In securing this win, the Cavaliers continue to keep a strong hold on the second projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings, with both the Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls trailing them by two games or more. The Hawks still own a 10 and a half game lead for the top overall spot, so it remains unlikely the Cavaliers can make up that gap in time for the playoffs. This marks a tough loss for the Nets, as it pushes them to three games behind the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the East.The Cavaliers shot really well in this game, going 55 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three-point line, while having seven players reach double figures in points. J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov led the team in scoring. Mozgov finished with 17 points (7-8 FG, 3-5 FT) and three rebounds in just 16 minutes, while Smith posted 17 points (6-13 FG, 5-10 3Pt) and two assists over 27 minutes. Mozgov has picked his game up of late and is averaging 12.8 points and 4.4 rebounds over his last five games. LeBron James also got into the action and finished with 16 points (5-13 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and seven assists. James had scored over 20 points in each of his last four games, but he didn't need to Wednesday, as everyone seemed to play well offensively and put up some points. Both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love chipped in with double-doubles. Irving recorded 12 points (5-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 10 assists, while Love had 10 points (4-9 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and 11 rebounds.Despite suffering the loss, Deron Williams posted a solid all-around game. In 28 minutes, he scored a team-high of 20 points (7-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT), while also adding six assists and two rebounds. He's been pretty inconsistent lately, but is averaging 10.4 points, 2.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.2 steals over his last five games. The Nets also saw some solid contributions from their bench. Center Mason Plumlee went a perfect 3-for-3 from the field, while going just 4-for-8 from the free throw line to score 10 points to go along with five rebounds in just 24 minutes. He hasn't produced much offensively since losing a large portion of his playing time to Brook Lopez, as this was just the first time in his last six games that he reached double figures in points. Both Bojan Bogdanovic and Jarrett Jack played well off the bench and finished with 12 and 11 points respectively.The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Friday, while the Nets will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.

												The Toronto Raptors (41-27) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14-53) 105-100 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.By securing this victory, the Raptors remained within two games of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who sit in the second projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. The Cavaliers took down the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday as well, so the Raptors avoided dropping another game back with a loss. The Timberwolves have now tied the New York Knicks for the worst record in the league, so they'll battle it out to see who will give themselves the best chance of landing the number one overall pick in this year's draft from here on out.  DeMar DeRozan really struggled with his shot in this game, going just 4-of-14 from the field. He made up for it at the free throw line though, as he forced his way into 12 attempts, while converting on all 12 of those attempts to push his scoring total to a team-high of 21 points. DeRozan continues to score at a very high rate, considering he's surpassed the 20-point mark in eight of his last nine games. Over his last 10 games, he's now averaging 22.4 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists. Jonas Valanciunas put in a good effort as well, notching a double-double with 15 points (7-9 FG, 1-2 FT) and 15 rebounds in just 23 minutes. It was his second double-double in a row, as he's combined for 29 points and 27 rebounds over his last two games. Terrence Ross was dialed in with his shot as well. He went 6-for-9 from the field and 3-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 15 points. Unfortunately for the Raptors, Kyle Lowry had to leave the game during the third quarter with what looked like a lower back injury and was not able to return.While they were unable to pull off the win, Kevin Martin had himself a game. He went 14-for-28 from the floor and 5-for-9 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 37 points, while also adding seven rebounds. He's picked up his scoring of late with so many injuries affecting this team, as he's averaging 18.0 points while shooting 44.6 percent from the field during his last four games. Andrew Wiggins also did his best to keep his team close. He went 6-for-9 from the field and 3-for-4 from the free throw line to score 15 points. After shooting 40 percent or lower in each of his last three games, it was good to see the forward get back on track Wednesday. Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger matched a season-high of 19 points (9-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 0-1 FT), to go along with eight rebounds. It was his second solid showing in a row, after scoring 18 points Monday. Ricky Rubio returned after missing two games, but had just two points (1-4 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and eight assists in 30 minutes.  The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Thursday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (16-52) defeated the Detroit Pistons (24-44) 94-83 on Wednesday in Philadelphia. The 76ers were able to pull off the win despite Nerlens Noel leaving the game with a right foot contusion after playing just 22 minutes. He had 11 points on 5-of-10 shooting, four rebounds and three blocks in that time and did not return.It was Ish Smith who led the way for Philadelphia, as he was moved into the starting point guard role while Isaiah Canaan was moved to the bench. Smith thrived in the role, recording 15 points on 6-of-12 shooting, eight assists and three steals in 26 minutes. Canaan struggled coming off the bench, putting up just nine points on 2-of-10 shooting and four assists in 22 minutes. Jason Richardson shot his way out of a slump, scoring 15 points on 4-of-7 shooting in 25 minutes, as it was just the first time in five games that Richardson scored in double figures. Conversely, Robert Covington struggled, as he shot just 1-of-6 from the field on his way to three points in 22 minutes off the bench. Thomas Robinson and Jerami Grant were able to make positive contributions in their reserve roles, scoring 12 and 10 points respectively. The win is just Philadelphia's third in 10 games, and they currently boast the third worst record in the NBA.It was a quick fall back to reality for the Pistons, as just a day after upsetting the Grizzlies and ending a 10-game losing streak, they lost to one of the NBA's worst teams. They were without Greg Monroe, who sat out his second consecutive game with a strained knee. Despite the loss, Detroit did have some strong performances. Reggie Jackson followed up Tuesday night's big game with a triple-double, putting up 11 points on just 4-of-17 shooting, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also followed up his 24-point performance on Tuesday in a strong way, scoring 20 points on 7-of-16 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 36 minutes. Beyond those two, the Pistons struggled, as no other Detroit player scored in double figures. By losing 11 of their previous 12 games, they are destined for the NBA lottery.Up next, the 76ers will take on the Knicks at home Friday, while the Pistons head home Saturday to take on the Bulls.

												The Miami Heat (31-36) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (44-22) 108-104 on Wednesday in Miami. The win was a big one for Miami, as it moves them a game ahead of the Pacers for seventh place in the Eastern Conference standings and three games back from the sixth-place Bucks. Dwyane Wade was once again spectacular for the Heat in the victory, scoring 32 points on 13-of-26 shooting, 15 points of which came in the fourth quarter, to go along with six assists and four rebounds in 39 minutes. Wade has been on a roll of late, as the team looks to make a push in this final stretch of the season. The All-Star has scored 32 points in back to back games and is averaging 29.8 points in his last six outings. Wade was not alone, as Luol Deng scored 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting in 42 minutes, while Goran Dragic recorded a double-double, putting up 20 points on 9-of-16 shooting and 11 assists in 39 minutes. Hassan Whiteside recorded a double-double of his own, recording 12 points on 6-of-11 shooting and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge had a monster game in the Trail Blazers' losing effort, posting 34 points on 15-of-24 shooting and 12 rebounds in 37 minutes. This was Aldridge's third double-double in a row and his fourth in the last five games. His effort was not enough though, as just two other Portland players scored in double figures. Damian Lillard scored 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting in 35 minutes and Arron Afflalo scored 15 points on 5-of-13 shooting in 33 minutes.The loss moves the Trail Blazers to fourth place in the Western Conference, as they are now a half game behind the Rockets for third place and two games behind the Grizzlies for second. Up next, the Heat will take on the Nuggets at home on Friday, while Portland will travel to Orlando and go up against the Magic on Friday. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Scotiabank Arena,14,53,41,27,12.0,29.0,35.0,79.0,23.0,27.0,39.0,25.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Terrence Ross,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,28,Andrew Wiggins,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,31,Amir Johnson,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Adreian Payne,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,19,Jonas Valanciunas,15.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Gorgui Dieng,7.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,38,DeMar DeRozan,7.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,39,Kevin Martin,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,37.0,14.0,28.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,44,Kyle Lowry,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,25,Ricky Rubio,8.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,30,Patrick Patterson,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,29,Chase Budinger,8.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,9.0,18.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,36,Lou Williams,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,12.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,25,Zach LaVine,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,19,Greivis Vasquez,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,25,Lorenzo Brown,2.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Tyler Hansbrough,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Kevin Garnett,,,,,,,,,,,,James Johnson,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Justin Hamilton,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Chicago Bulls (41-28) dominated the Indiana Pacers (30-37) 103-86 on Wednesday in Chicago. Nikola Mirotic has thrived in his sixth man role, as Taj Gibson missed his 10th straight game, and Wednesday was no different. Mirotic scored a game-high 25 points on 8-of-15 shooting and grabbed nine rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. In his last two games, Mirotic has scored 52 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and is due for a minutes increase even when Gibson returns from injury. After four straight games scoring in single digits, Mike Dunleavy put together a solid performance, scoring 21 points on 7-of-14 shooting, to along with five rebounds. Pau Gasol recorded yet another double-double, posting 19 points on 7-of-13 shooting and 12 rebounds in 33 minutes, while Joakim Noah scored just six points, but was active elsewhere, recording 14 rebounds and seven assists. The win pushes Chicago to just a half game behind the Raptors for third place in the Eastern Conference standings and two and a half games behind the second-place Cavaliers. However, they still only hold a one-game lead over the Wizards for fourth place.Four starters scored in double figures for the Pacers in the losing effort, but as a team, they could not get anything going, shooting poorly at 40 percent from the field. Solomon Hill led the team in scoring, putting up just 13 points on 5-of-10 shooting, six rebounds and three rebounds. Roy Hibbert (12), George Hill (10) and C.J. Miles (10) round out the four Indiana starters in double figures, while Rodney Stuckey put up just 11 points on 4-of-11 shooting in 31 minutes off the bench.The loss moves Indiana out of the current playoff race in the East, as the Celtics own the tie breaker over them. However, they still stand just one game behind the seventh-place Heat.Up next, the Bulls will take on the Raptors at home on Friday, while the Pacers will head to Cleveland on Friday to play the Cavaliers. 											",Chicago,Bulls,Indiana,Pacers,United Center,30,37,41,28,10.0,24.0,34.0,82.0,25.0,28.0,52.0,22.0,12.0,6.0,19.0,31.0,80.0,16.0,21.0,38.0,15.0,9.0,Mike Dunleavy,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,38,Solomon Hill,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25,Pau Gasol,12.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,33,David West,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Joakim Noah,14.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Roy Hibbert,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Tony Snell,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,39,CJ Miles,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,29,Aaron Brooks,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,27,George Hill,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,30,Nazr Mohammed,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Rodney Stuckey,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,30,Kirk Hinrich,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,22,Ian Mahinmi,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,14,Nikola Mirotic,9.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,25.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,30,Luis Scola,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Doug McDermott,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Damjan Rudez,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,E'Twaun Moore,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,C.J.

												The San Antonio Spurs (42-25) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (34-34) 114-103 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.After suffering an embarrassing loss to the Knicks in their previous game, the Spurs got back on track against the Bucks. The win puts them a half game behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the six projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings, while they own a four and a half game lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Bucks, on the other hand, have now lost four in a row and currently remain just two and a half games ahead of the Miami Heat for the sixth spot in the Eastern Conference standings. If they don't get things turned around soon, they could end up getting knocked out of the playoffs by the end of the regular season.Danny Green led the team in scoring, going 7-for-16 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 20 points while also adding eight rebounds and two steals. He's picked it up offensively over his last five games, averaging 15.0 points while shooting 50 percent from the field during that stretch. Tim Duncan had his way in the post against the Bucks' frontcourt, finishing with 19 points (9-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT), five rebounds, seven assists and three blocked shots. Duncan has put in two strong games in a row, combining for 36 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists over those two outings. Tony Parker was nearly perfect shooting the ball. He went 6-for-7 from the field and 1-for-1 from beyond the arc to record 15 points in just 27 minutes. The Spurs also received some contributions frmo their bench. Boris Diaw chipped in with 18 points (5-8 FG, 8-8 FT) and six rebounds, while Marco Belinelli added 11 points (2-9 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and two rebounds.Like the Spurs, the Bucks also had six players reach double figures in points. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with 19 points (8-16 FG, 3-3 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots over 37 minutes. He's riding a nice five-game stretch where he's averaging 17.2 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists. Khris Middleton shot the ball well, going 5-for-8 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 15 points. He had a brutal showing against the Pelicans on Tuesday, shooting just 14 percent (2-14 FG) from the floor and missing all four of his three-point attempts, so it was good to see him have a much higher rate of success Wednesday. Ersan Ilyasova also shot the ball well and scored 17 points (7-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-3 FT) to go along with six rebounds and two assists. Coming off the bench, Jerryd Bayless added 12 points (4-8 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) as well.The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday, while the Bucks will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Friday. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,San Antonio,Spurs,Fiserv Forum,42,25,34,34,7.0,14.0,39.0,80.0,18.0,24.0,43.0,28.0,11.0,8.0,19.0,36.0,70.0,30.0,38.0,32.0,27.0,8.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,9.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,19.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,37,Tim Duncan,5.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,19.0,9.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,34,Ersan Ilyasova,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,33,Kawhi Leonard,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,27,Zaza Pachulia,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Tiago Splitter,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Khris Middleton,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,30,Danny Green,8.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,38,Michael Carter-Williams,0.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,33,Tony Parker,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,27,Jerryd Bayless,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,24,Boris Diaw,6.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,John Henson,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Marco Belinelli,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,24,Tyler Ennis,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,19,Jeff Ayres,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Chris Johnson,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,9,Patty Mills,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,16,Miles Plumlee,11.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Matt Bonner,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (38-30) defeated the Boston Celtics (30-37) 122-118 on Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.This marked a big win for the Thunder, as they passed up the New Orleans Pelicans for the eighth and final projected seed in the Western Conference standings. The Pelicans are just a half game behind them though, with the Suns trailing by just three games as well, so it'll remain a fight for the last seed all the way until the end of the regular season in the West. The Celtics, on the other hand, are currently in the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference standings. They're even with the Indiana Pacers, but hold the tie breaker, so they remain ahead of them for now. The Celtics are also just a game behind the Miami Heat for the seventh spot.With both Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka out due to injury, Russell Westbrook continued to put on a show. He didn't have the best night shooting the ball (8-26 FG, 1-6 3Pt), but he got to the free throw line at will and converted on 19-of-22 attempts to push his scoring total to a game-high of 36 points. He also added five rebounds, 10 assists, and five steals, but turned it over seven times. Over his last 10 games, Westbrook has averaged 33.4 points, 11.0 rebounds and 10.3 assists while shooting 42 percent from the field, as he pushes his name even further into MVP consideration. He got some help from Enes Kanter though, who double-doubled with 22 points (10-13 FG, 2-2 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. It marked his fourth double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaged an impressive 19.5 points and 12.8 rebounds per game. Coming off the bench, Anthony Morrow went 7-for-11 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while adding six rebounds as well. Steven Adams remained in the starting lineup with Ibaka out, and added a double-double of his own with 14 points (5-9 FG, 4-7 FT) and 13 rebounds.Marcus Smart put in arguably the best game of his career in the Celtics' loss. He hit seven three-pointers on his way to 25 points (8-14 FG, 7-12 3Pt, 2-4 FT), while also adding nine rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocked shots, as he did a little bit of everything Wednesday. The points and blocks were both season-highs for the rookie, who now averages 7.6 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.3 assists on the year. Brandon Bass was the other starter to reach the 20-point mark, as he finished wtih 20 points (8-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and four assists in 30 minutes. Like Smart, it was a season-high in points for Bass, but it still wasn't enough to pull off the win over the Thunder. Coming off the bench, Kelly Olynyk went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 20 points in just 23 minutes. It was the first time since early January that he reached 20 points.The Thunder's next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Celtics will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Friday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (44-25) defeated the Orlando Magic (21-49) 107-102 on Wednesday in Dallas. A big fourth quarter gave the Magic a shot in the closing minutes, but the Mavericks proved to be just too much for them. Dirk Nowitzki led the way for Dallas, and he looked like vintage Nowitzki in the process, scoring 25 points on 9-of-15 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 31 minutes. Monta Ellis was the only other starter for the Mavericks who scored in double figures, finishing with 21 points on 9-of-17 shooting in 36 minutes. Rajon Rando put together a nice stat line, recording nine points, six rebounds and 11 assists in 29 minutes. Chandler Parsons followed up a big 31-point performance on Monday with an unimpressive eight points on 3-8 shooting Wednesday.Off the bench, Devin Harris recorded 12 points and five assists in 22 minutes, while Charlie Villanueva scored 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting in just nine minutes. The victory brings Dallas to fifth place in the Western Conference, as they currently stand just a half game ahead of the Clippers and one game ahead of the Spurs. All five Magic starters scored in double figures Wednesday night, while Elfrid Payton led the way with a triple-double in the losing effort. The rookie recorded 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in 41 minutes.Victor Oladipo struggled with his shot, going just 7-of-20 from the field and 0-of-6 from the three-point line, but still managed 19 points, six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes. Maurice Harkless (18), Nikola Vucevic (12) and Channing Frye (10) round out the Orlando starters in double figures, while typical-starter Tobias Harris sat the game out with an ankle injury.Up next, the Mavericks will take on the Grizzlies at home on Friday, while Orlando will head home Friday and go up against the Trail Blazers. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Orlando,Magic,American Airlines Center,21,49,44,25,13.0,31.0,39.0,80.0,16.0,24.0,40.0,28.0,20.0,9.0,28.0,40.0,87.0,13.0,14.0,41.0,28.0,18.0,Chandler Parsons,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,27,Maurice Harkless,6.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,15.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,36,Dirk Nowitzki,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,15.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,30,Channing Frye,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,23,Tyson Chandler,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,30,Nikola Vucevic,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Monta Ellis,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,21.0,9.0,17.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,36,Victor Oladipo,4.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,20.0,0.0,6.0,5.0,37,Rajon Rondo,6.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,28,Elfrid Payton,10.0,12.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,40,Charlie Villanueva,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,8,Aaron Gordon,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,14,Devin Harris,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,22,Ben Gordon,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,13,Amar'e Stoudemire,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Luke Ridnour,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,18,J.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (44-25) defeated the Sacramento Kings (22-45) 116-105 on Wednesday in Sacramento. Chris Paul was outstanding in the victory, as he played one of his better games of the season. Paul scored a game-high 30 points on 13-of-20 shooting and dished out 11 assists in 39 minutes. The All-Star point guard has now had 20-plus points and five-plus assists in each of his last three games.J.J. Redick also had a very impressive outing, scoring 27 points on 9-of-16 shooting from the field and 7-of-12 from the three-point line. Blake Griffin also continues to be solid since returning from his extended absence due to an elbow injury. He recorded 19 points Wednesday on 7-of-16 shooting, 10 rebounds and five assists, giving him three double-doubles in his last three games since the injury.Matt Barnes sat out Wednesday's game with a hamstring injury, while Hedo Turkoglu was thrust into the starting lineup in his place. Turkoglu played well, scoring 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting in 33 minutes. DeAndre Jordan only scored six points, but had 15 rebounds and four blocks on the night. The win moves the Clippers up to fifth place in the Western Conference, as they are holding a tiebreaker over the Mavericks for that position. Los Angeles also is just one and a half games behind the Trail Blazers for fourth place.The Kings were without All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins, who was out with a calf injury, and his absence hurt the team as they were unable to close down the stretch. Rudy Gay, however, after missing two games with a knee injury, did play and led the team in scoring with 23 points on 6-of-19 shooting, to go along with six rebounds, four assists and three steals. Jason Thompson was the only other Sacramento starter in double figures, recording 12 points on 5-of-10 shooting and eight rebounds in 34 minutes. Andre Miller contributed a solid 16 points on 8-of-11 shooting, four assists and three rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench, while Nik Stauskas scored 13 points on 4-of-6 shooting in 23 minutes off the bench. Ben McLemore played beyond poorly, shooting 0-for-5 from the field and scoring zero points.Up next, the Clippers will head home to take on the Wizards on Friday, while the Kings will go up against the Hornets on Friday in Sacramento.

												The Golden State Warriors (54-13) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (53-15) 114-95 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.After suffering a 124-116 loss to the Hawks back in February, the Warriors got plenty of revenge Wednesday, finishing with a convincing 19-point victory over the Hawks. The Hawks winning streak ends at three, but they still sit with a hefty 10-game lead over the Cavaliers for the top spot in the Eastern Conference standings. The Warriors, on the other hand, have extended their own winning streak to three games, while pushing their Western Conference standings lead to seven and a half games over the Memphis Grizzlies.  The Warriors shot the ball extremely well  Wednesday, going 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line. Harrison Barnes was unstoppable in this matchup, going 11-for-13 from the floor and 2-for-3 from deep to score a game-high of 25 points, while also adding four rebounds in 28 minutes. It was a new season-high in points for Barnes, as he's only surpassed the 20-point mark in two other games this season. The Warriors also saw a strong effort from Andre Iguodala, who came off the bench for 21 points (9-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT), six assists and three steals. Like Barnes, Iguodala just couldn't miss tonight, as he posted a new season-high in points as well. We can't leave out superstar Stephen Curry though, as he posted 16 points (4-11 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and 12 assists in 30 minutes. Even without backcourt parnter Klay Thompson (ankle), Curry got some help from the rest of the team, as everyone seemed to step up. Draymond Green added 18 points (6-11 FG, 5-7 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and seven rebounds as well.The Hawks just couldn't keep up with the red-hot Warriors. DeMarre Carroll did as much as he could to keep the Hawks close, scoring 16 points (5-12 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. It marked his second straight 16-point showing, while the double-double was his first since December. Paul Millsap matched Carroll with 16 points (6-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own while adding nine rebounds and two steals. He's played real well as of late, averaging 19.3 points and 9.3 rebounds over his last three games. Jeff Teague and Shelvin Mack were the only other two players in double figures. Teague finished with 12 points (4-8 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and three steals, while Mack had 10 points (4-8 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and three steals off the bench.  The Warriors' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, while the Hawks will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Friday.

												The Washington Wizards (40-28) defeated the Utah Jazz (30-37) 88-84 on Wednesday in Salt Lake City. Following what was a tough stretch after the All-Star break, the Wizards are rolling and winners of five games in a row and seven of their last nine. John Wall led the way for Washington in this one, recording 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting, nine rebounds and six assists in 37 minutes. Wall has been hot as of late, averaging 25.3 points, 9.7 assists and 6.7 rebounds in his last three outings. Paul Pierce was the only other Wizard to score in double figures, finishing with 18 points on 6-of-10 shooting (4-5 3Pt) in 28 minutes. The win pushes Washington to just a half game behind the Bulls for fourth place in the Eastern Conference standings, while also giving them a six-game lead over Milwaukee for fifth place. The loss for the Jazz ended a six-game winning streak, but Utah has still won nine of its last 11 games. Gordon Hayward has been great in that stretch for them, and he played well once again Wednesday night, scoring a game-high 26 points on 9-of-19 shooting, to go along with four rebounds and four assists in 35 minutes. Derrick Favors was the only other Jazz starter to score in double figures, finishing with 16 points on 8-of-18 shooting and nine rebounds. Trey Burke made a strong contribution off the bench, recording 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting and six assists in 28 minutes. Rudy Gobert finished with nine points and 14 rebounds, extending his streak of games with double-digit rebounds to 10. Dante Exum was brutal in the start at point guard, as he shot 0-for-6 from the field and finished with zero points and zero assists in 20 minutes. Up next, the Wizards will head to Los Angeles Friday to take on the Clippers, while the Jazz will also head to Los Angeles and go up against the Lakers on Thursday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Washington,Wizards,Vivint Smart Home Arena,40,28,30,37,4.0,22.0,34.0,82.0,12.0,24.0,36.0,21.0,9.0,6.0,11.0,33.0,63.0,16.0,23.0,41.0,16.0,21.0,Gordon Hayward,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,26.0,9.0,19.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,35,Paul Pierce,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,28,Derrick Favors,9.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,37,Nene,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,33,Rudy Gobert,14.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,37,Marcin Gortat,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,36,Rodney Hood,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,29,Bradley Beal,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,40,Dante Exum,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,20,John Wall,9.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,37,Trevor Booker,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,Drew Gooden,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,18,Elijah Millsap,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10,Rasual Butler,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Trey Burke,0.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,27,Ramon Sessions,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,18,Joe Ingles,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,20,Kevin Seraphin,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Jack Cooley,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Otto Porter Jr.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9

												The Detroit Pistons (24-43) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (47-21) 105-95 on Tuesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.  Coming close to playing themselves completely out of the playoffs after losing 10 games in a row, the Pistons gave themselves some hope Tuesday, as they came out with a 10-point win over the Grizzlies. The win brings them within six and half games of the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference, but they will still need to keep on winning with just 15 games left in the season. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, continue to sit as the second seed in the West, seven games behind the Golden State Warriors, but just one and a half games ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. They've lost five of their last ten games now, but they will still likely finish in the top half of the standings if they don't go on some extended losing streak in the near future.A big part of the win should be attributed to the Pistons' defense, as they forced the Grizzlies into 18 turnovers, while committing just nine of their own. Reggie Jackson led the way on the offensive side of the ball though, scoring 23 points (10-18 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT), while also handing out a ridiculous season-high of 20 assists. It was only his third game posting double-digit assists this season, while this arguably marked his best game since joining the Pistons at the trade deadline. Andre Drummond notched a double-double of his own, finishing with 16 points (6-12 FG, 4-6 FT), 16 rebounds and five blocked shots. He had suffered a concussion during Saturday's game, but cleared the concussion protocol prior to this matchup and played as if there were no lingering problems. With Greg Monroe sitting out due to a knee injury, Anthony Tolliver moved into the starting lineup. He took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points (4-12 FG, 4-9 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and seven rebounds. After failing to reach double-digit points in nine straight games, he's now gone two straight with 14 points or more. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had a solid shooting effort as well and added 24 points (10-16 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 2-3 FT) in 37 minutes. With Mike Conley sidelined due to an ankle injury, it was the Grizzlies' frontcourt that had the most production, despite still suffering the loss. Gasol posted a double-double with 17 points (6-11 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT), 11 rebounds and six assists. He had scored less than his season average of 17.8 points per game in each of his last three outings, so it was good to see the center get back on track Tuesday. Jeff Green was locked in with his shot, going 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-3 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 21 points. He's now pushed his season averages to 15.1 points and 4.2 rebounds on the year. Zach Randolph and Vince Carter were the only other players in double figures for points. Randolph finished with 13 points (6-13 FG, 1-1 FT) and five rebounds, while Carter had 14 points (4-8 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and three rebounds off the bench. The Pistons' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, while the Grizzlies will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Friday.

												The New York Knicks (14-53) outlasted the San Antonio Spurs (41-25) in overtime, 104-100.

Alexey Shved canned the clinching free throws in overtime to seal the victory.Rookie Langston Galloway poured in a career-high 22 points on 18 shots in a career-high 48 minutes. Journeyman Lou Amundson added 12 points, a career-high 17 rebounds, two assists, and two blocks in 30 minutes. For the seventh straight game, Cole Aldrich blocked at least one shot, swatting two in 19 minutes.

												The Houston Rockets (45-22) defeated the Orlando Magic (21-48) 107-94 on Tuesday at the Toyota Center in Houston.While the Magic are on the brink of being eliminated from the playoffs in the East after losing five games in a row, the Rockets remain in the thick of things in the West. They continue to stick as the projected fourth seed for the playoffs, but sit just behind the Portland Trail Blazers, who currently own a 44-21 record. If the Trail Blazers go on to lose to the Heat on Wednesday, the Rockets would then take over the third spot in the Western Conference standings with a half game lead over Portland. The Rockets were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic finished at just 43 percent from the floor and 27 percent from deep.Donatas Motiejunas was dialed in from the start, as he went 8-for-12 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 23 points, while also adding seven rebounds and four assists. After shooting just 20 percent (3-15 FG) during Sunday's game against the Clippers, it was a nice bounce-back game for him. While James Harden struggled with his shot, he continued to get to the free throw line like he has all season and finished with 17 points (4-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-11 FT), eight rebounds and three steals. While it wasn't his best performance, Harden remains entrenched in the conversation as one of the top three potential MVP candidates in the league. On the season, he boasts averages of 26.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game. Trevor Ariza recorded 17 points (7-11 FG, 3-7 3Pt) of his own, to go along with five rebounds and five asssists. The Rockets received some strong contributions from their bench as well though, with both Josh Smith and Corey Brewer reaching double figures. Smith finished with 17 points (6-9 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five rebounds, while Brewer had 13 points (5-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 12 rebounds. While they ended up suffering the loss, Victor Oladipo did his best to keep the Magic in this game. He went 11-for-21 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 29 points, while also adding four rebounds and four steals. He's on a nice two-game stretch where he's combined for 54 points, 10 assists and six steals. Nikola Vucevic didn't have his best game offensively, but still posted 11 points (5-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt) to go along with 11 rebounds and two blocked shots. It marked his fourth double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 17.0 points and 12.8 rebounds. Elfrid Payton chipped in with 10 points (5-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and seven assists as well, while Ben Gordon came off the bench for 13 points (5-9 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in just 19 minutes. Tobias Harris left the game with a sprained ankle after playing just 17 minutes.  The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Thursday, while the Magic will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Wednesday. 											",Houston,Rockets,Orlando,Magic,Toyota Center,21,48,45,22,11.0,27.0,39.0,77.0,18.0,27.0,47.0,27.0,14.0,6.0,22.0,38.0,88.0,12.0,17.0,40.0,19.0,10.0,Trevor Ariza,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,32,Tobias Harris,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,16,Donatas Motiejunas,7.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,32,Dewayne Dedmon,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Joey Dorsey,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Nikola Vucevic,11.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,11.0,5.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,James Harden,8.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,34,Victor Oladipo,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,29.0,11.0,21.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,37,Patrick Beverley,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,35,Elfrid Payton,4.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,33,Terrence Jones,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,30,Aaron Gordon,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Pablo Prigioni,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11,Luke Ridnour,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,19,Josh Smith,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,17.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,26,Channing Frye,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,26,Corey Brewer,12.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,28,Ben Gordon,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,19,KJ McDaniels,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Maurice Harkless,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17

												The New Orleans Pelicans (37-30) escaped with an 85-84 win over the Milwaukee Bucks (34-33). Ersan Ilyasova missed a wide-open, game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer.The Pelicans claimed the eight seed in the Western Conference, holding the tiebreaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder, who possess the same record. This was the last time the Pelicans face an Eastern Conference squad, increasing difficulty of retaining that playoff spot. Anthony Davis left briefly in the fourth quarter with an apparent leg injury. He returned moments later after receiving treatment on the sideline. In 42 minutes, Davis finished with 20 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three blocks and one steal. Tyreke Evans scored 10 of his 12 points in the first quarter, combined with 10 rebounds, six assists and one steal in 37 minutes. Quincy Pondexter provided 18 points and five three-pointers.The Bucks lost their third straight and eight of their last ten. They maintain a three and a half game lead over the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat for the six seed. Michael Carter-Williams shot 2-of-12 in his return to the lineup after missing one game due to an ankle injury. Jerryd Bayless played 34 minutes off the bench following three missed games with his own ankle injury, supplying 14 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Jared Dudley (back) and O.J. Mayo (hamstring) didn’t play the first night of a back-to-back, and Miles Plumlee received a DNP-CD as coach Jason Kidd preferred his eight-man rotation. John Henson recorded four of the Bucks’ 12 blocks.The Pelicans begin a three-game road trip Thursday against the Phoenix Suns. The Bucks quickly turn around Wednesday with a home game against the San Antonio Spurs before going back on the road.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (43-25) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (29-37) 99-92 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. This marked a tough loss for the Hornets, as they're now a full game behind the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. They still have plenty of time left in the season to make their way into playoff contention, but they're trending in the wrong direction with two losses in a row. The Clippers, on the other hand, moved into the fifth spot in the Western Conference standings, as they own the tie breaker over the Dallas Mavericks. If they can continue with their winning ways, they'll have the opportunity to move into the top half of the playoff field, especially if any of the top four teams struggle in the last 14 games or so of the regular season. The Clippers were led by their backcourt duo of J.J. Redick and Chris Paul. Redick went 10-for-17 from the field, but 0-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high 23 points. With both Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford out, he was again able to get off a ton of shots. Over his last seven games, he's averaging 21.4 points, despite averaging just 15.3 points on the season. Paul was just as successful though and finished with 21 points (6-16 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and eight assists. He's riding a nice two-game stretch where he's combined for 44 points and 13 assists. Blake Griffin notched a double-double with 19 points (8-12 FG, 3-3 FT) and 11 rebounds. In the two games he's played since returning from the injury that costed him just over a month, he's posted two double-doubles and has combined for 30 points, 22 rebounds and 12 assists. DeAndre Jordan pitched in with a double-double of his own, finishing with 12 points (3-6 FG, 6-12 FT) and 14 rebounds. The Hornets had six players reach double figures in points Wednesday, including all five starters. Al Jefferson led the way offensively, posting a team-high of 21 points (9-19 FG, 3-5 FT), to go along with six rebounds. He had scored 10 points or less in each of his last two games, so it was good to see the center get back on track in this one. Mo Williams continued to play well for the Hornets and finished with 18 points (8-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt), four rebounds and eight assists. Since joining the Hornets 14 games ago, he's averaging 19.8 points, 2.6 rebounds and 7.6 assists, as he continues to establish himself as a very valuable player. Gerald Henderson also added 16 points (5-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and two steals as a starter. While the Hornets' bench only combined for a total of 17 points, it pretty much all came from Kemba Walker, as he recorded 15 points (3-8 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and three rebounds in just 24 minutes off the bench. It was just his fourth game since returning from injury, so it was good to see him looking more comfortable out on the court.The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, while the Hornets will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings on Friday. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,Charlotte,Hornets,Staples Center,29,37,43,25,9.0,24.0,35.0,77.0,20.0,28.0,44.0,24.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Hedo Turkoglu,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,21,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,37,Blake Griffin,11.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Marvin Williams,11.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,DeAndre Jordan,14.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Al Jefferson,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,JJ Redick,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,10.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,39,Gerald Henderson,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,36,Chris Paul,3.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,16.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,35,Mo Williams,4.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,15.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,35,Austin Rivers,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,18,Jason Maxiell,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Nate Robinson,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,21,Kemba Walker,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,24,Dahntay Jones,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Bismack Biyombo,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Glen Davis,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Lance Stephenson,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,Spencer Hawes,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,11,Troy Daniels,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Toronto Raptors (40-27) defeated the Indiana Pacers (30-36) 117-98 on Monday in Indianapolis. The Raptors were led by their All-Star point guard, Kyle Lowry, who recorded a triple-double of 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 38 minutes. He also had three steals. It was Lou Williams, however, who led the team in scoring, putting up an efficient 24 points on 8-of-17 shooting in just 23 minutes. DeMar DeRozan was not far behind, scoring 22 points on 6-of-19 shooting in 37 minutes.Jonas Valanciunas recorded his first double-double in six games, recording 14 points on 7-of-12 shooting and 12 rebounds in 26 minutes. Valanciunas' partner in the front court, Amir Williams, also had a solid night, posting 11 points and nine rebounds in 19 minutes. Terrence Ross left the game with back spasms after just 21 minutes on the court.For Toronto, the win brings them within 2.5 games of the Cavaliers for second place in the Eastern Conference standings with just 15 games left on the schedule.The Pacers were led in the losing effort by starting point guard George Hill. Hill scored 23 points on 9-of-15 shooting in 34 minutes, while the effort was his second game in a row scoring 20-plus points. Four of the five Indiana starters scored in double figures, with Roy Hibbert (17), C.J. Miles (12) and Solomon Hill (11) rounding out the four. Rodney Stuckey also continued his strong play as of late, scoring 20 points on 9-of-16 shooting off the bench. Stuckey has scored 20-plus points in three of his last four games now. Despite recording 21 assists to just four turnovers, the Pacers still fell short, and the loss leaves them tied with the Hornets for the eigth seed in the East, with Miami just a half game behind them.Up next, the Raptors will head home Wednesday to take on the Timberwolves, while Indiana will travel to Chicago and go up against the Bulls on Wednesday. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Toronto,Raptors,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,40,27,30,36,2.0,16.0,38.0,85.0,20.0,25.0,36.0,21.0,4.0,12.0,23.0,39.0,82.0,27.0,33.0,51.0,19.0,11.0,Solomon Hill,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,35,Terrence Ross,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,20,David West,9.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Amir Johnson,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,28,Roy Hibbert,7.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,17.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Jonas Valanciunas,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,14.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,CJ Miles,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,25,DeMar DeRozan,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,George Hill,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,33,Kyle Lowry,11.0,10.0,3.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,38,Ian Mahinmi,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Patrick Patterson,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Rodney Stuckey,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,27,Greivis Vasquez,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,24,Luis Scola,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Tyler Hansbrough,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,C.J.

												The Washington Wizards (39-28) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (44-21) 105-97 on Monday at the Verizon Center in Washington. This marked another big win for the Wizards, who have turned their struggles around and have now won four games in a row. They currently sit as the fifth projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings, just a half game behind the Chicago Bulls and four and a half games ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks. The loss for the Trail Blazers ends their winning streak at three games. They're currently positioned in the third projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings, but the loss brings the Rockets to within a half game of the Trail Blazers and pushes the Grizzlies to a two-game lead over the Trail Blazers for that number two spot.The Wizards shot well in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 58 percent from the three-point line, while having all five starters in double figures for points. The backcourt duo of Bradley Beal and John Wall led the way. Beal recorded a team-high of 23 points (8-13 FG, 4-4 3Pt, 3-6 FT), to go along with seven assists, while Wall finished with 21 points (10-23 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT), nine rebounds and 11 assists, coming just shy of a triple-double. Beal had shot under 40 percent in each of his two previous games, so he was much more successful with his shot Monday, including hitting on all of his three-point attempts. Wall, on the other hand, has posted two double-doubles in a row, combining for 52 points and 23 assists over that span. After missing the two previous games for personal issues, Nene Hilario returned to score 12 points (5-13 FG, 2-4 FT), while also adding seven rebounds. Both Paul Pierce and Marcin Gortat chipped in with 16 points apiece. The Trail Blazers saw most of their production from LaMarcus Aldridge, who notched a double-double with 24 points (10-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and 12 rebounds. It was his second double-double in a row, after posting 24 points and 10 rebounds against the Raptors Sunday. Arron Afflalo found his shot Monday, going 5-for-9 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 15 points. He's started to pick his game up of late, averaging 14.7 points over his last three games. Also finishing with a double-double was Nicolas Batum, who added 12 points (4-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 15 rebounds. The 15 rebounds were a new season-high for the forward. Damian Lillard chipped in with 14 points (5-18 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and nine assists as well.  The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, while the Trail Blazers' will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Wednesday. 											",Washington,Wizards,Portland,Trail Blazers,Capital One Arena,44,21,39,28,,,,,,,,,,8.0,28.0,36.0,89.0,17.0,20.0,48.0,19.0,10.0,Paul Pierce,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,32,Nicolas Batum,15.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,39,Nene,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,LaMarcus Aldridge,12.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,24.0,10.0,19.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,38,Marcin Gortat,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,38,Robin Lopez,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Bradley Beal,4.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,13.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,39,Arron Afflalo,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,26,John Wall,9.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,21.0,10.0,23.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,41,Damian Lillard,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,18.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,38,Drew Gooden,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,20,CJ McCollum,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,18,Rasual Butler,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Chris Kaman,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Ramon Sessions,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Steve Blake,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,12,Kevin Seraphin,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Dorell Wright,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,DeJuan Blair,,,,,,,,,,,,Meyers Leonard,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,15

												The Boston Celtics (30-36) dominated the Philadelphia 76ers (15-52) in a 108-89 victory on Monday in Boston. All five Celtics' starters scored in double figures, as Boston has now won five games in a row and seven of their last eight. They were led by Tyler Zeller, who scored a season-high 26 points on 11-of-15 shooting and grabbed five rebounds in 28 minutes. Zeller has now scored 44 points on 19-of-25 shooting in his last two outings.Avery Bradley posted a double-double for the Celtics, recording 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting and 10 rebounds, to go along with six assists in 35 minutes. Marcus Smart (11) and Evan Turner (10) round out the Boston starters in double figures, while Luigi Datome and Jae Crowder each scored 10 points off the bench. The Celtics' recent success has come even without Isaiah Thomas (back), who's missed the last four games. The win brings Boston up to seventh place in the Eastern Conference standings, owning tiebreakers over both Indiana and Charlotte with just 16 games left on the schedule. The 76ers were led by Nerlens Noel in the losing effort, who posted 18 points on 7-of-15 shooting and seven rebounds. Despite Philadelphia's constant struggles, Noel has played great as of late, posting three double-doubles in his last six games.On the other end of the spectrum, Jason Richardson had yet another poor shooting day, scoring just two points on 1-of-7 shooting, as he has failed to reach double-digit scoring in his last three outings. Starters Hollis Thompson (13), Isaiah Canaan (11) and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute (10) all scored in double figures, while Ish Smith scored 16 points on 7-of-13 shooting in 27 minutes off the bench.The 76ers recorded just 20 assists to 16 turnovers and continue to boast one of the worst records in the NBA. Up next, Boston will travel to Oklahoma City on Wednesday to take on the Thunder, while Philadelphia heads home to go up against the Pistons on Wednesday. 											",Boston,Celtics,Philadelphia,76ers,TD Garden,15,52,30,36,8.0,20.0,44.0,87.0,11.0,13.0,40.0,27.0,11.0,8.0,24.0,34.0,84.0,13.0,24.0,40.0,20.0,16.0,Evan Turner,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Hollis Thompson,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,30,Brandon Bass,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Luc Mbah a Moute,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,23,Tyler Zeller,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,11.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Nerlens Noel,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Avery Bradley,10.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,14.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,35,Jason Richardson,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,20,Marcus Smart,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,29,Isaiah Canaan,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,28,Kelly Olynyk,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15,Ish Smith,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,26,Gigi Datome,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,20,Robert Covington,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,22,Jae Crowder,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,21,Jerami Grant,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,24,Jonas Jerebko,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13,Thomas Robinson,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Phil Pressey,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,20,Henry Sims,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14

												The Memphis Grizzlies (47-20) defeated the Denver Nuggets (26-42) 92-81 on Monday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis. After winning each of their last four games, the Nuggets couldn't hold onto it any longer, as the Grizzlies were just too much for them. While they haven't technically been eliminated from the playoffs yet, they're currently 12 games back from the Oklahoma City Thunder, who sit in the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, are currently the second projected playoff seed in the West, six games back from the Golden State Warriors. With the Trail Blazers losing to the Wizards earlier Monday, the Grizzlies have extended their lead to two games over them. The Grizzlies got the bulk of their offensive production from their frontcourt duo of Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol. Randolph finished with a team-high of 21 points (9-20 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT), to go along with 16 rebounds. Randolph had gone four straight games without a double-double, so he was able to return to form Monday. He's now averaging 16.4 points and 11.2 rebounds on the season. Gasol recorded 14 points (4-13 FG, 6-8 FT) of his own, while adding eight rebounds and three blocked shots. He's scored less than his season average of 17.8 points in four of his last five games now, but the Grizzlies still keep on winning. The Grizzlies had some solid contributions from the bench as well, with both Tony Allen and Nick Calathes reaching double figures in points. Allen finished with 14 points (5-10 FG, 4-4 FT) and nine rebounds over 35 minutes, while Calathes posted 12 points (5-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and two steals. With Conley sitting out due to an ankle injury, Beno Udrih started at guard and finished with nine points (4-8 FG, 1-3 3PT) in 24 minutes.The Nuggets struggled to get much going offensively, as they held Kenneth Faried, Danilo Gallinari and Ty Lawson all out on a night of rest. Jameer Nelson was in the starting lineup for Lawson, as he went 11-for-18 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 24 points to go along with five rebounds. It was a new season-high in points for the guard, who's averaging an impressive 19.7 points over his last three games. Randy Foye was the starter at shooting guard and finished with 16 points (6-14 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own, while also adding three steals in 33 minutes. He's had a nice two-game stretch, combining for 36 points and 11 assists over his last two outings. The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was Wilson Chandler, who chipped in with 13 points (4-10 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and eight rebounds over 36 minutes. The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Thursday. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Denver,Nuggets,FedExForum,26,42,47,20,2.0,9.0,33.0,80.0,24.0,28.0,57.0,14.0,19.0,8.0,18.0,30.0,81.0,13.0,21.0,37.0,14.0,15.0,Jeff Green,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Wilson Chandler,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,35,Zach Randolph,16.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,20.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,38,Darrell Arthur,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,29,Marc Gasol,8.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,14.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,33,Jusuf Nurkic,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Courtney Lee,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,33,Randy Foye,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,14.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,33,Beno Udrih,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,24,Jameer Nelson,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,11.0,18.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,34,Tony Allen,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,35,JJ Hickson,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,Nick Calathes,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,24,Erick Green,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Kosta Koufos,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Will Barton,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,23,Vince Carter,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,19,Joffrey Lauvergne,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Russ Smith,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Gary Harris,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16

												The Golden State Warriors (53-13) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (17-49) 108-105 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. While the Lakers have already been eliminated from the playoffs, this win pushes the Warriors to six and a half games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies, who sit second in the Western Conference standings. The Warriors have now won two games in a row and eight of their last ten, as they comfortably hold their lead in the West. Despite taking the loss, the Lakers finised with a 45-37 rebounding advantage and shot an impressive 50 percent from the three-point line. The Warriors' superstar duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson did it again Monday. Thompson went 10-for-22 from the field and 3-for-9 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 26 points, while also adding three rebounds. Thompson has been scoring at a high rate lately, as he's averaging 25.2 points over his last five games. Curry, on the other hand, finished with 26 points (5-14 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 7-7 FT), nine assists and three steals in 33 minutes. He's put in two solid performances in a row, combining for 44 points, 20 assists and six steals in his last two outings. Also playing a big factor in the win was Draymond Green, as he recorded 16 points (7-14 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and a game-high of five steals. He's been a force defensively for the Warriors, with this marking his second game in a row with five steals. Harrison Barnes chipped in with 11 points (3-8 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) as well.The Lakers saw a true team-effort in the loss, with six players reaching double figures in points. Jordan Clarkson was impressive, going 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while also adding six rebounds and a pair of steals in just 25 minutes. He has shot below 35 percent from the field in each of his last three games, so it was good to see him get pointed back in the right direction Monday. Wayne Ellington posted 17 points (6-13 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own in 30 minutes. It was some nice production from the guard, with this being his highest scoring performance since the beginning of February. Notching a double-double, Jordan Hill finished with 15 points (6-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 12 rebounds. The Lakers also saw some good contributions off the bench. Jeremy Lin had 15 points (3-8 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 8-10 FT) and four assists, while Carlos Boozer added 10 points (5-12 FG) and nine rebounds.  The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Thursday. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Brooklyn,Nets,Target Center,27,38,14,52,,,,,,,,,,5.0,13.0,51.0,89.0,13.0,17.0,42.0,20.0,13.0,Andrew Wiggins,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,37,Joe Johnson,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,10.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,25,Adreian Payne,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Thaddeus Young,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,Gorgui Dieng,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,39,Brook Lopez,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Kevin Martin,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,7.0,16.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,31,Markel Brown,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Zach LaVine,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,15.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,30,Deron Williams,1.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,22,Justin Hamilton,6.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Jarrett Jack,5.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,23,Chase Budinger,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,26,Mason Plumlee,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Lorenzo Brown,5.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Cory Jefferson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Kevin Garnett,,,,,,,,,,,,Bojan Bogdanovic,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,10.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,27,Gary Neal,,,,,,,,,,,,Alan Anderson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,16

												The Brooklyn Nets (27-38) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14-52) 122-106 on Monday at the Target Center in Minneapolis. While the Timberwolves have already been eliminated from playoff contention in the Western Conference, the Nets continue to stay alive for a shot in the East. With their second win in a row, the Nets now sit just two and a half games behind the Indiana Pacers for the final projected playoff seed, with plenty of games left in the season to make their way back into the mix. The Nets shot really well in this game, going 58 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 47 percent from the floor, but an impressive 60 percent from deep. With Ricky Rubio still sidelined with an ankle injury, Zach LaVine continued to run as one of the starting guards for the second game in a row during Monday's loss. He took advantage of the start once again, finishing with 20 points (8-15 FG, 4-6 3Pt) and three assists in 31 minutes. He just recorded 18 points and six assists in Sunday's game against the Spurs, so LaVine has been making his case for extended playing time. Kevin Martin had a strong showing as well though, posting 20 points (7-16 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and six assists in 32 minutes. He's been shooting the ball well of late, especially from the three-point line, as he's combined to go 5-for-8 from beyond the arc over his last two games. The Timberwolves saw some impressive contributions from the bench as well. Chase Budinger had his shot locked in and scored 18 points (8-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt) in just 26 minutes, while Justin Hamilton posted 15 points (6-14 FG, 3-3 FT) and six rebounds as well. Despite a season scoring average of 4.3 points on the year, he' picked his game up recently and is averaging 14.0 points over his last four games, while playing extra minutes with so many injuries. The Nets' frontcourt did the bulk of the work for Brooklyn in the win, combining for 57 points. Joe Johnson led the way, as he went 10-for-14 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 22 points to go along with five rebounds in just 25 minutes. He's been hitting nearly everything lately, combining to go 16-for-24 from the field over his last two games. Thaddeus Young also had a strong showing, finishing with 19 points (8-17 FG, 3-4 FT) and three rebounds. Since joining the Nets 13 games ago, he's averaging 14.1 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.5 steals while starting five of those games. Brook Lopez was the third member of the starting lineup in double figures, as he recorded 16 points on 7-of-8 shooting from the floor. Coming up big on the bench was both Jarrett Jack and Bojan Bogdanovic. Jack chipped in with 16 points (6-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five assists, while Bogdanovic added 21 points (10-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt) and four rebounds. The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Toronto to play the Raptors on Wednesday. 											",Miami,Heat,Cleveland,Cavaliers,AmericanAirlines Arena,43,26,30,36,,,,,,,,,,11.0,33.0,30.0,79.0,21.0,27.0,32.0,17.0,14.0,Luol Deng,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,36,LeBron James,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,8.0,19.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,35,Udonis Haslem,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Tristan Thompson,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Hassan Whiteside,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Timofey Mozgov,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Dwyane Wade,2.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,32.0,13.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,30,JR Smith,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,27,Goran Dragic,5.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,39,Kyrie Irving,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,5.0,15.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,34,Mario Chalmers,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,28,Iman Shumpert,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,21,Henry Walker,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,23,James Jones,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,31,Chris Andersen,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Matthew Dellavedova,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Michael Beasley,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Kendrick Perkins,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Zoran Dragic,,,,,,,,,,,,Shawn Marion,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

												The Utah Jazz (30-36) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (29-36) 94-66 on Monday in Salt Lake City.The Jazz dominated from start to finish, opening up a 49-19 lead midway through the second quarter, and the team continues to be one of the hottest teams in the NBA despite their playoff chances being slim-to-none, as they've won six straight games and nine of their last 10.Rodney Hood led the way, putting in a career-best effort of 24 points on 9-of-11 shooting in just 22 minutes. Hood has been in a groove as of late, averaging 18.3 points in his last four outings. Rudy Gobert continues to be dominant on the glass, recording his second 22-rebound game in his last three outings, to go along with nine points. The 22-year-old has now posted nine straight games with double-digit rebounding totals and is averaging 15.8 boards in that stretch.  Gordon Hayward (18), Dante Exum (11) and Derrick Favors (10) round out the Utah players who scored in double figures, while Trey Burke struggled off the bench for the Jazz, shooting just 3-of-14 from the field and scoring eight points. Nobody on the Hornets could get anything going Monday night, as they put in one of their worst team performances of the season. Lance Stephenson led the team in scoring, putting up 17 points on 6-of-13 shooting in 24 minutes. Al Jefferson recorded 10 points and seven rebounds and was the only other Charlotte player in double figures. Charlotte shot a woeful 30 percent from the field and recorded just nine assists on 23 made field goals. The loss knocks Charlotte back to a half game out of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference standings. Up next, the Jazz will stay at home Wednesday to take on the Wizards, while the Hornets will head to Los Angeles to go up against the Clippers on Tuesday. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Oklahoma City,Thunder,American Airlines Center,37,30,43,25,10.0,25.0,42.0,89.0,25.0,35.0,37.0,27.0,12.0,7.0,26.0,40.0,90.0,28.0,35.0,59.0,19.0,21.0,Chandler Parsons,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,31.0,10.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,38,Dion Waiters,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,36,Dirk Nowitzki,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,18.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,27,Enes Kanter,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,37,Tyson Chandler,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Steven Adams,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,30,Monta Ellis,5.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,20.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,37,Andre Roberson,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,12,Rajon Rondo,4.0,13.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,32,Russell Westbrook,8.0,12.0,4.0,1.0,24.0,7.0,17.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,36,Charlie Villanueva,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,19,Anthony Morrow,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,26,Devin Harris,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Nick Collison,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Amar'e Stoudemire,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Mitch McGary,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Richard Jefferson,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11,D.J.

												The Miami Heat (30-36) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (43-26) in convincing fashion Monday, winning 106-92 in Miami. LeBron James is now 0-for-2 in his returns to Miami this season, and his former teammate Dwyane Wade has outplayed him in both of those outings. Wade scored an amazingly efficient 32 points on 13-of-18 shooting, to go along with five steals in 31 minutes. In his two games against Cleveland in Miami this season, Wade has scored 43 points in 68 minutes.Following Wade was Goran Dragic, who recorded 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting, nine assists and five rebounds in 40 minutes. Hassan Whiteside recorded yet another double-double, posting 16 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in 32 minutes. Mario Chalmers played one of his best games as a reserve, scoring 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting, to go along with five rebounds and three assists in 29 minutes off the bench. The win for Miami not only gives them the lead in the season series over James and the Cavaliers, but it also pushes them into eighth place in the Eastern Conference standings with tiebreakers over Boston and Charlotte.Despite the loss, James still put in a solid performance, posting 26 points on 8-of-19 shooting and four assists. After scoring 90 points in his previous two games, Kyrie Irving cooled off a bit, scoring 21 points on just 5-of-15 shooting and dishing out six assists in 34 minutes. Timofey Mozgov scored 10 points and was the only other Cleveland player to score in double figures. Kevin Love (rest) sat out for the second consecutive game. Despite the loss, the Cavaliers still hold a two-game lead over the Toronto Raptors for second place in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Heat will stay home Wednesday and go up against the Trail Blazers, while Cleveland will head home to take on the Nets on Wednesday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Charlotte,Hornets,Vivint Smart Home Arena,29,36,30,36,15.0,24.0,33.0,76.0,11.0,17.0,59.0,19.0,12.0,3.0,16.0,20.0,71.0,13.0,16.0,29.0,8.0,6.0,Gordon Hayward,7.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,26,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Derrick Favors,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,25,Marvin Williams,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Rudy Gobert,20.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,29,Al Jefferson,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Rodney Hood,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,11.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,21,Gerald Henderson,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22,Dante Exum,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,27,Mo Williams,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,23,Joe Ingles,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,23,Kemba Walker,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,24,Elijah Millsap,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,24,Bismack Biyombo,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Trey Burke,6.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,21,Jason Maxiell,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Trevor Booker,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Lance Stephenson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,23,Jack Cooley,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Jeffery Taylor,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12

												The Dallas Mavericks (43-25) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (37-20) 119-115 on Monday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The Mavericks picked up a big win Monday, as it moved them up to the fifth seed in the Western Conference standings. They now sit two games back from the Houston Rockets, and just a half game ahead of both the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers. It was also a really tough loss for the Thunder, who are positioned in the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West. With the Pelicans also taking a loss Sunday, the Thunder were still able to hold onto a half game lead over New Orleans despite the loss. The Mavericks were down by 10 at half, but came out and had a monster second half. Chandler Parsons led the way, going 10-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 31 points, while also adding four rebounds. His shot has been absolutely locked in of late, combining to go 18-for-26 from the field and 8-for-11 from the three-point line to score 53 points over his last two games. Monta Ellis had a strong showing as well though, finishing with 24 points (8-20 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 8-11 FT), five rebounds and three steals. He forced his way to the free throw line in this game, matching a season-high of 11 attempts, while converting on eight of those 11 attempts. The third member of the starting lineup to surpass the 20-point mark was Dirk Nowitzki. In 27 minutes, Nowitzki recorded 22 points (8-18 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds. He hadn't scored over 14 points in each of his last six games, so it was good to see him get some more points on the board. Rajon Rondo chipped in with 11 points (5-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and 13 assists as well.With Serge Ibaka (knee) out for the forseeable future, Steven Adams and Enes Kanter teamed up at the center and power forward positions. Each played well in the loss, with Adams posting 15 points (5-8 FG, 5-6 FT) and eight rebounds, while Kanter had 19 points (7-12 FG, 5-5 FT) and 13 rebounds. Kanter has posted three double-doubles in a row, a stretch where he's averaging 20.0 points and 15.3 rebounds, as he's really stepped up his production with Ibaka sidelined. Like we've grown accustomed to, Russell Westbrook came just shy of another triple-double. In 36 minutes, he finished with 24 points (7-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 9-10 FT), eight rebounds and 12 assists. While continuing to make his case for the league MVP, Westbrook has pushed his season averages to 27.5 points, 7.2 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game. Mitch McGary added a double-double off the bench with 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-4 FT) and 13 rebounds, but made a rookie mistake in the closing few minutes, intentionally fouling Ellis when the Thunder had enough time left in the game to make a stop.  The Mavericks' next game will come at home against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, while the Thunder will take on the Boston Celtics on Wednesday. 											",Sacramento,Kings,Atlanta,Hawks,Golden 1 Center,53,14,22,44,7.0,20.0,38.0,81.0,20.0,25.0,45.0,23.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,Omri Casspi,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,36,DeMarre Carroll,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,34,Carl Landry,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Paul Millsap,10.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,34,DeMarcus Cousins,13.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,20.0,7.0,19.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,33,Elton Brand,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Ben McLemore,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,28,Kent Bazemore,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,29,Ray McCallum,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,22,Jeff Teague,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,6.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,36,Nik Stauskas,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,27,Shelvin Mack,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,21,Derrick Williams,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,14,Pero Antic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Andre Miller,2.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,28,Dennis Schroder,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,22,Jason Thompson,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Mike Muscala,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Reggie Evans,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Austin Daye,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Atlanta Hawks (53-14) defeated the Sacramento Kings (22-44) 110-103 on Monday in Sacramento. The Hawks were without two of their All-Stars Monday night, as Al Horford was given the night off to rest and Kyle Korver (nose) had been ruled out for the remainder of the Hawks' current road trip to the West Coast. It was no problem however, as Atlanta's other two All-Stars played extremely well. Paul Millsap recorded a double-double in the winning effort, posting 19 points on 8-of-13 shooting and 10 rebounds in 35 minutes. Jeff Teague scored a game-high 23 points on 6-of-16 shooting and recorded six assists and four rebounds in 36 minutes as well. Coming off a career-best game where he scored 24 points and dished out 10 assists, Dennis Schroder struggled from the field this time around, shooting a poor 3-of-12 from the field and scoring just 10 points. He was, however, still able to dish out six assists. DeMarre Carroll recorded 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting, eight rebounds and three steals in 35 minutes, while Kent Bazemore scored 11 points in his start. Shelvin Mack was the final Hawk to score in double figures, scoring 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes off the bench. Atlanta continues to sit comfortable atop the Eastern Conference, boasting an 11-game lead over second place, while having the second best record in the NBA.DeMarcus Cousins led the way for the Kings in the losing effort, posting a double-double of 20 points, 13 rebounds, five assists and three blocks. It wasn't enough however, as the Kings could have used Rudy Gay, who sat out Monday's contest with a knee injury. Despite Gay's absence from the starting lineup, Sacramento was still able to get some solid offensive production. Jason Thompson scored 18 points on 7-of-7 shooting in 24 minutes off the bench, while Andre Miller also produced in a reserve role, posting 16 points and seven assists in 18 minutes. Omri Casspi added 16 points on 6-of-13 shooting, while Ben McLemore and Ray McCallum round out the six Kings' players in double figures, scoring 11 and 10 respectively. Up next, the Hawks will travel to Oakland Wednesday to take on the Warriors in a battle between the NBA's best, while Sacramento will stay home and go up against the Clippers on Wednesday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Los Angeles,Lakers,Chase Center,17,49,53,13,7.0,27.0,40.0,84.0,21.0,23.0,35.0,28.0,14.0,8.0,15.0,39.0,85.0,19.0,21.0,45.0,24.0,18.0,Harrison Barnes,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,23,Wesley Johnson,5.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,38,Draymond Green,8.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,34,Jordan Hill,12.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,29,Andrew Bogut,7.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Tarik Black,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Klay Thompson,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,10.0,22.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,34,Wayne Ellington,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,29,Stephen Curry,4.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,5.0,14.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,32,Jordan Clarkson,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,25,Andre Iguodala,2.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30,Jeremy Lin,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,22,Festus Ezeli,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Carlos Boozer,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Shaun Livingston,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Jabari Brown,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,20,David Lee,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Ed Davis,4.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Justin Holiday,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,10,Ryan Kelly,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (37-29) beat the Chicago Bulls (40-28) 109-100 in a matinee matchup at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday.The win put the Thunder a half game up on the New Orleans Pelicans for the final playoff spot in the West. New Orleans will try to even things up again when they host the Denver Nuggets on Sunday evening.Kevin Durant (foot) remains out indefinitely, but there is some hope he'll be able to return in the next 1-to-2 weeks. Oklahoma City has also played without starting power forward Serge Ibaka the last two games, using Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Mitch McGary and Nick Collison to help fill the gaps in their frontcourt while Russell Westbrook guides the ship in Durant's absence and picks up a lot of the scoring slack. Westbrook scored a game-high 36 points to go with 11 rebounds and six assists in 41 minutes. He's scored the game-high mark in five of his last six games, doing his best to will the Thunder into the playoffs and make his case for the MVP Award.Chicago has had their own injury issues of late, with Derrick Rose (knee), Jimmy Butler (elbow) and Taj Gibson (ankle) all sidelined. Gibson has returned to practice but has not been cleared to return to game action. Rookie forward Nikola Mirotic has helped pick up most of the scoring load that was left in the absence of the Bulls' injured stars, and he posted a team-high 27 points in 30 minutes off the bench Sunday.Chicago lost the game because they couldn't keep Oklahoma City's big men off the glass. Between Adams and Kanter, the Thunder collected 17 offensive rebounds, giving them enough extra possessions to lock up the game even though the Bulls forced them into 17 turnovers, on which they were able to score an easy 27 points.The Thunder have won five of their last seven games as they fight for the final spot in the West playoff standings, overcoming the adversity they've been handed as a result of numerous injuries. The Bulls, on the other hand, have lost five of their last six games, and while they still hold the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference playoff standings, their inability to stay competitive without a fully healthy roster is concerning for their potential to take a series when they reach the postseason. Oklahoma City will play the Mavericks in Dallas on Monday, and Chicago will have a few days off before hosting the Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Phoenix Suns (35-33) defeated the New York Knicks (13-53) 102-89 on Sunday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.This was a huge win for the Suns, as they were starting to lose ground on both the Oklahoma City Thunder and New Orleans Pelicans for the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. They now sit two games behind the Pelicans and three games behind the Thunder, so there won't be much room for anymore losses moving forward in their fight to get into the playoffs. The Suns shot well in this game, finishing at 49 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Knicks went 44 percent from the floor and 36 percent from deep.With Brandon Knight still sidelined with an ankle injury, Eric Bledsoe again stepped up for the Suns and posted a team-high of 21 points (8-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-6 FT), to go along with nine rebounds and 11 assists as well. He's on a strong stretch of four games, averaging 19.8 points and 7.3 assists during that span. Brandan Wright moved into the starting lineup at center for the first time this season, with Alex Len sitting out with an ankle injury. Wright took advantage of the start and finished with 18 points (7-8 FG, 4-5 FT) and 11 rebounds in 37 minutes. It was a new season-high in points for him, while also marking his first double-double since his first game of the season back in November. Marcus Morris was dialed in with his shot as well, going 9-for-14 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 20 points. It was his second strong performance in a row, as he's combined for 38 points and 10 rebounds over his last two.As has been the case all season, the Knicks struggled to get anything going offensively. Andrea Bargnani and Alexey Shved did the majority of the scoring. Bargnani finished with 18 points (7-16 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and three assists, while Shved added 18 points (6-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-8 FT) and four rebounds. Shved has been one of the few bright spots of late, averaging 17.2 points and 5.8 rebounds over his last five games. Bargnani has also been solid over his last few games, as this marked his second 18-point performance in as many games. The only other Knick in double figures was Lance Thomas, who recorded 14 points (4-8 FG, 6-10 FT) and four rebounds in 29 minutes.The Suns' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday, while the Knicks will be at home against the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday.

												The Rockets (44-22) edged out the Clippers (42-25) 100-98 in Los Angeles on Sunday.Houston had a 10-point lead at the end of the third quarter, but allowed the Clippers to get back into the game late. With seven minutes remaining, Los Angeles went on a 13-5 run. They finally tied the game 96-96 on a Chris Paul three-pointer with three minutes left on the clock. The Rockets' Terrence Jones answered back with a three-pointer of his own at the two-minute mark. With less than 20 seconds to play and the Rockets up 99-98, the Clippers' Blake Griffin stole a pass intended for James Harden, dribbled down the court and attempted to draw a shooting foul, only to be called for charging. On the ensuing possession, Harden went 1-1 from the free-throw line. Down 100-98, Paul missed the equalizer as time expired.NBA MVP candidate Harden finished the game with 34 points (7-16 FG, 3-5 3Pt) in 41 minutes. Half of those points came from the free- throw line. In the second quarter, the Clippers' Matt Barnes bear hugged Harden and threw him to the ground, drawing a flagrant-1 foul.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (44-20) defeated the Toronto Raptors (39-27) 113-97 on Sunday at the Air Canade Centre in Toronto.This win marks the third in a row for the Blazers, as they currently sit as the third projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings, just one game back from the Grizzlies and one game ahead of the Rockets. The Raptors, on the other hand, have lost eight of their last ten games, but sit tied for the third projected playoff seed with the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference standings. The Trail Blazers shot well in this outing, going 52 percent from the field and 45 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors went 47 percent from the floor and just 28 percent from deep.With all five starters reaching double figures in points, it was a nice team-effort win for the Trail Blazers on Sunday. Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge led the way, as each surpassed the 20-point mark. Aldridge went 9-for-14 from the field and 6-for-8 from the free throw line to score a team-high of 24 points, while also adding 10 rebounds and five assists. It marked his second double-double over his last three games, a stretch where he's averaging 24.0 points and 10.3 rebounds. Lillard, on the other hand, finished with 23 points (10-2- FG, 2-8 3Pt, 1-2 FT) of his own, to go along with five assists and two steals. He's played well of late, combining for 51 points and 14 assists over his last two games. On the season, he's now averaging 21.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. Nicolas Batum was able to notch a double-double as well, posting 10 points (3-5 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 12 assists over 34 minutes. It was just the second time this season that he's reached double-digit assists.Despite suffering the loss, DeMar DeRozan had a solid performance for the Raptors, finishing with 22 points (9-18 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and eight rebounds. He really struggled with his shot in Friday's game against the Heat, shooting just 25 percent (3-12 FG) from the field in that outing, so it was good to see him get things pointed back in the right direction Sunday. Jonas Valanciunas went a perfect 7-for-7 from the field to score 14 points, while also pulling down nine rebounds in 22 minutes. Valanciunas missed Friday's game following the birth of his son, so it was good to see him come back without missing a beat. Struggling with his shot, Kyle Lowry ended with just 10 points (3-11 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT), but added six assists and four rebounds. He had shot a combined 17-for-31 from the field and 10-for-17 from the three-point line over his last two games, so his performance Sunday was somewhat of a disappointment.The Trail Blazers' next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Raptors will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Monday.

												The Denver Nuggets (26-41) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (36-30) 118-111 on Sunday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.With 12 seconds left in the game, Anthony Davis came up clutch for the Pelicans, hitting a jumper to put them up by two. On the next possession down, Kenneth Faried matched Davis and converted on a layup to tie the game up with just four seconds left in regulation. Davis then had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but his shot was long and rattled out of the hoop. In overtime, the Pelicans again had a three-point lead with just under 10 seconds left. Will Barton was the savior this time around and tied the game with a huge three-pointer for the Nuggets on the next possession, forcing it into a second overtime. The Pelicans struggled offensively in the second overtime, with Tyreke Evans scoring their only two points, and they went on to take a seven-point loss.This was a tough loss for the Pelicans, who are in a fierce battle for the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. They now sit a full game back from Oklahoma City for that eighth seed, so they'll need bounce back with a win on Tuesday. Despite taking the loss, Davis continued to play extremely well, as he finished with a game-high of 36 points (16-28 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT) to go along with 14 rebounds, seven assists and nine blocked shots. He did a little bit of everything in this game, nearly recording a quadruple-double by the end. Davis recorded his fifth double-double of his last six games, a six-game stretch where he's averaged 30.8 points, 11.2 rebounds and 5.0 blocks. Evans came just short of a triple-double of his own and posted 25 points (11-20 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT), nine rebounds and 10 assists. He's shot extremely well of late, finishing 55 percent or higher from the field in each of his last three games.Along with making a game-tying bucket at the end of regulation, Faried also posted 20 points (7-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and 10 rebounds in the win. With Jusuf Nurkic returning to the starting lineup at center, Faried was able to move back to his natural power forward position. The Nuggets also saw a strong bench effort, with both Barton and Jameer Nelson reaching double figures. Barton recorded 25 points (10-16 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and nine rebounds in 47 minutes while Nelson posted 18 points (7-16 FG, 4-8 3Pt) and six assists in 38 minutes. Since joining the Nuggets at the trade deadline, he's averaged 14.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.2 steals over 13 games. Ty Lawson chipped in with 19 points (9-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt) and nine assists in his return to action after sitting out the Nuggets' last game with an illness.The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Monday.

												The Cavaliers (43-25) defeated the Magic (21-47) 123-108 in Orlando on Sunday.Down 28-26 at the end of the first quarter, Cleveland took the lead 12 seconds into the second quarter and never looked back. Kyrie Irving led the team in scoring, following up his career-high 57 point performance against the Spurs on Thursday with 33 points (12-15 FG, 5-6 3Pt), four rebounds, four assists and one steal in 35 minutes. J.R. Smith contributed 25 points (7-14 FG, 6-11 3Pt) in 34 minutes, and LeBron James had 21 points (9-14 FG, 0-3 3Pt), eight rebounds, 13 assists, three steals and one block in 35 minutes. Kevin Love sat out Sunday's game to rest. Victor Oladipo led the Magic in scoring with 25 points (8-21 FG, 3-4 3Pt) to go with one rebound, seven assists and two blocks 41 minutes. Tobias Harris had 24 points (9-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt) in 46 minutes, and Nikola Vucevic had 22 points (11-21 FG, 0-0 3Pt) and 15 rebounds in 33 minutes.James continues to make his case for the MVP Award while allowing Irving to shine as well. The Cavaliers are locked into second place in the Eastern Conference playoff standings, sitting 9.5 games behind the East-leading Atlanta Hawks, a chasm the Cavs are unlikely to be able to close with just 14 games left on the schedule for them this season.Up next, the Cavaliers hit the road against the Heat on Monday. The Magic will play the Rockets in Houston on Tuesday.

												The Spurs (41-24) trounced the Timberwolves (14-51) 123-97 in San Antonio on Sunday.Coming off a 125-point performance against Cleveland on Thursday, San Antonio posted its second-highest point total of the season against the Timberwolves. The Spurs scored the first basket of the game and never surrendered the lead. San Antonio had eight players score in double digits. Kawhi Leonard led the team in scoring with 15 points (6-13 FG, 2-2 3Pt), to go along with six rebounds, one assist, five steals and one block in 25 minutes. Manu Ginobili left the game with what appeared to be a right ankle injury in the third quarter, but still finished with 11 points (4-5 FG, 3-4 FT) and three rebounds over 18 minutes.Facing a litany of injuries, the Timberwolves were short-handed on Sunday with only eight healthy players. Minnesota had trouble holding onto the basketball, turning the ball over 15 times. Those turnovers translated into 33 points for the Spurs. Kevin Martin led the team in scoring with 19 points (7-18 FG, 2-3 3Pt), to go with five rebounds, two assists and one steal. With Ricky Rubio out with an ankle injury, Zach LaVine moved into the starting lineup at guard, and took advantage of the start to score 18 points (7-13 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT), while also adding six rebounds and six assists.San Antonio is currently fifth in the Western Conference, 11 games behind the West-leading Warriors. Up next, the Spurs travel to New York to take on the Knicks on Tuesday.

												The Hawks (51-14) held on to defeat the Lakers (17-47) 91-86 at the Staples Center on Sunday. Atlanta was able to come away with the victory despite being severely short-handed. Starters Jeff Teague, DeMarre Carroll and Paul Millsap sat out to rest, while Kyle Korver left the game early in the second quarter with a broken nose. The Lakers cut a 15-point fourth quarter deficit down to a single basket with 30 seconds left on the clock. But they couldn't hold off the Hawks when it counted, as Dennis Schroder extended the lead for Atlanta to four points with 13 seconds remaining. Schroder had a great game, scoring 24 points (7-16 FG, 1-5 3Pt) to go with three rebounds, 10 assists and one steal in 38 minutes as a starter. Al Horford contributed 21 points (10-21 FG, 0-1 3Pt), five rebounds, three assists, five steals and one block in 35 minutes. The Lakers did not take care of the basketball, turning it over 21 times. Carlos Boozer and Ryan Kelly led the team in scoring with 13 apiece. Boozer also led the team in turnovers with four. The Hawks are currently the top team in the Eastern Conference, 10 games ahead of the Cavaliers. They've won nine of their last 11 games.With only 17 games left on their schedule, the Lakers have been eliminated from playoff contention. The Hawks and Lakers split the season series 1-1.The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Monday, while the Lakers will travel to Oakland to play the Golden State Warriors on Monday.

												The Boston Celtics (29-36) snapped the Indiana Pacers’ (30-35) seven-game winning streak, extending their own streak to four wins in the 93-89 victory. Wearing their St. Patrick’s Day sleeved jerseys, the Celtics held the Pacers to 40 percent shooting and pulled to within a half game of the eight seed in the EastEven though Evan Turner was unable to replicate his 30-point outing from Friday, Tyler Zeller used his speed against Roy Hibbert to compile 18 points and seven rebounds. Coach Bradley Stevens earned his first win in the arena he called home as the coach of the Butler Bulldogs. Avery Bradley, Brandon Bass, and Jae Crowder all added 16 points. The Celtics out-assisted the Pacers, 28-16, and held them to 37 first-half points. Isaiah Thomas missed his third straight game due to back and elbow soreness.The Pacers allowed a team to shoot better than 40 percent for the first time in eight games. Also, it’s the first time all season they lost when George Hill led in scoring, registering 30 points, eight assists, five rebounds, one steal and two three-pointers in 35 minutes. Their bench, which had been instrumental in their recent success, was limited to 30 points. The loss gives them a one-game advantage over the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics, both teams just outside the playoff picture.The Celtics will attempt to win their fifth straight game Monday when they face the Philadelphia 76ers at home. The Pacers conclude a four-game homestand Monday against the Toronto Raptors.

												The Washington Wizards (38-28) needed a torrid second half shooting performance to defeat the Sacramento Kings (22-43) 113-97 on Saturday at the Verizon Center. Sacramento led by as many as 21 early in the third quarter before Washington woke up and went on a 21-6 run to narrow the gap. Ramon Sessions, who came over to Washington from Sacramento at the trade deadline, canned the go ahead three early in the fourth and the Wizards never looked back. DeMarcus Cousins fouled out with 5:33 remaining and the Kings could never recover, managing just nine points for the rest of the game. Sacramento's brutal eight-game road trip finally came to an end in Washington on Saturday. The Kings went just 2-6 on the trip to fall further towards the bottom of the Western Conference. Rudy Gay did not suit up for this game after suffering a strained patellar tendon Friday. His replacement, Omri Casspi, managed only two points and a rebound over 15 minutes on the floor. The Kings will return home on Monday to host the Hawks.The Wizards were facing their second straight opponent that was at less than full strength after playing a Memphis team that rested three starters on Thursday. It looked ugly early on, but the Wizards managed to shift into high gear to escape with a win. John Wall put on a show with 31 points and 12 assists. Nene Hilario missed his second straight game due to personal reasons and is questionable for Washington's next outing. The Wizards will host the Trail Blazers on Monday before embarking on a four-game Western Conference road trip. 											",Washington,Wizards,Sacramento,Kings,Capital One Arena,22,43,38,28,13.0,26.0,43.0,81.0,14.0,17.0,41.0,28.0,13.0,6.0,19.0,35.0,77.0,21.0,28.0,36.0,24.0,16.0,Paul Pierce,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,23,Omri Casspi,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,15,Drew Gooden,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,25,Carl Landry,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Marcin Gortat,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,DeMarcus Cousins,6.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,30.0,9.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,29,Bradley Beal,5.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,33,Ben McLemore,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,27,John Wall,2.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,31.0,9.0,15.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,38,Ray McCallum,6.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,28,Kevin Seraphin,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Jason Thompson,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Rasual Butler,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,27,Andre Miller,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,22,Otto Porter Jr.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,12,Derrick Williams,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,33,Ramon Sessions,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,13,Reggie Evans,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,DeJuan Blair,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Nik Stauskas,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,22

												The Brooklyn Nets (26-38) helped their playoff chances with a 94-87 win over the Philadelphia 76ers (15-51), snapping a five-game losing streak. The Sixers shot 8-of-37 on three-pointers in the loss.Thaddeus Young scored his most points as a Net, recording 21 on 15 shots and hit a three-pointer for the 11th straight game, a career-high. The oft-injured Brook Lopez played his 38th straight contest, more than double his total from last season. With the win, the Nets pulled to within three games of the eight seed. They converted just 2-of-17 three-pointers. Joe Johnson made a field goal for the 866th consecutive game, the longest active streak in the NBA.Brett Brown shuffled up the starting lineup, replacing Robert Covington with Jason Richardson, who rested Friday’s game. Jerami Grant started his first game of the season because Luc Mbah a Moute was rested. Nerlens Noel continued to pad his Rookie of the Year résumé, notching 17 points, seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and two blocks in 30 minutes before fouling out. Glenn Robinson III played seven minutes in his 76ers’ debut, forced into action after the Sixers were whistled for nine fouls in the first seven minutes. Thomas Robinson grabbed 12 rebounds in 17 minutes and is averaging 8.7 rebounds per game in 17.5 minutes per game in nine games with the Sixers.The Brooklyn Nets take on the Minnesota Timberwolves, the worst Western Conference team, on Monday for the first time since trading away Kevin Garnett for Thaddeus Young.

												The Utah Jazz (29-36) won their fifth straight game while extending the Detroit Pistons’ (23-43) losing streak to 10 consecutive games, effectively diminishing their playoff hopes in the 88-85 win. Andre Drummond was disqualified from the second half with a concussion, per league protocols. The two teams combined for 25 points in the third quarter.Derrick Favors took advantage of Andre Drummond’s absence, scoring 26 points in 35 minutes and attempting a career-high 13 free throws. Rudy Gobert grabbed 19 rebounds and blocked two shots in 39 minutes, padding his stats in a last ditch effort to garner Defensive Player of the Year votes. The Jazz has now won 12 of their past 15 games, overlapping with the trade of Enes Kanter to Oklahoma City. They’re seven games back of the final playoff spot with 17 games remaining, drawing an outside shot of postseason basketball if everything falls their way.Shawne Williams was suspended after squaring off in a head-butting competition with the Trail Blazers’ Joel Freeland in Friday’s loss. Tayshaun Prince was forced from the game with a sore hip, but he returned briefly in the waning moments to inbound the ball. Reggie Jackson was benched down the stretch, turning the ball over five times and making 4-of-11 shots. The Pistons’ bench accounted for 52 points in the loss.The Jazz host the Charlotte Hornets on Monday, and the Pistons get two days off before playing the Memphis Grizzlies at home.

												The Charlotte Hornets (29-35) pulled out the win over the Chicago Bulls (40-27), 101-91, by limiting them to 31 second-half points. Joakim Noah was assessed his seventh technical foul in his return to the starting lineup after missing one game for rest. The Bulls were outrebounded 55-36 and are now one game behind the Toronto Raptors in the loss column.Bismack Biyombo filled in for the injured Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller, compiling 10 points and 10 rebounds in 22 minutes. Kemba Walker, in his second game since returning from a knee injury, played 28 minutes. Seven different Hornets scored at least 10 points, led by Gerald Henderson’s 20. The Hornets moved into the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference.Though the Bulls’ youngsters were asked to shoulder more of an offensive load, it wasn’t enough to secure a win over the eight-seeded Hornets. Nikola Mirotic, a contender for Rookie of the Year, scored 15 points on 5-of-15 shooting. Doug McDermott added 13 points and three three-pointers and Tony Snell matched his career-high with five three-pointers, notching 17 points in 36 minutes. Pau Gasol failed to record a double-double for just the 20th time all season.The Hornets have two days off before commencing a five-game road trip against the resurging Utah Jazz. The Bulls conclude a three-game road trip Sunday against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (15-50) defeated the Sacramento Kings (22-42) 114-107 on Friday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.After being out-scored by 20 points in the second quarter, the Sixers had themselves in a hole, as they were down 64-51 at the half. They came out with a big third quarter though, where they out-scored the Kings 37-18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven-point win in front of their home crowd. While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs, it was still a nice win for the Sixers, who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season.The Sixers didn't have the best night shooting the ball, but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three-point line as a team. Robert Covington led the way, scoring 24 points (8-17 FG, 6-12 3Pt, 2-3 FT), to go along with two assists and three steals. It was the most points he's scored since the beginning of February, as he matched a season-high in hitting six three-point shots.Covington did receive some help though, as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points (7-13 FG, 2-2 FT), 12 rebounds and a blocked shot. Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring, but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double-digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games. He's averaging 8.9 points and 7.8 rebounds on the season. The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant. Grant went 5-for-7 from the field to score 13 points, while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes. He had gone a combined 1-for-7 from the field over his last two games, so it was good to see him get things turned around. Ish Smith added 10 points (3-11 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-6 FT), five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well.Despite taking the loss, DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game. Cousins went 12-for-24 from the field and 15-for-20 from the free throw line to score a game-high of 39 points, while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process. Cousins continues to play well of late, as this was his fifth straight double-double. Over that five-game stretch, he's averaging 25.4 points and 16.2 rebounds, as he's one of the hottest players in the league. Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close. In 40 minutes on the court, Gay finished with 24 points (7-17 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 9-10 FT) and four rebounds. Like Cousins, he's played extremely well over his last five games, averaging 27.8 points during that span, while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams, who came off the bench for 15 points (5-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and three rebounds in 31 minutes. The Sixers' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday.

												The Boston Celtics (27-36) held the Orlando Magic (21-45) to 38 second-half points in their 95-88 victory. Evan Turner led all scorers with a season-high 30 points on 12-20 shooting as the Celtics pull to within a game of the final Eastern Conference playoff spot.The Celtics are riding a three-game winning streak with contributions from the entire roster. Without Isaiah Thomas, Phil Pressey recorded his third career double-double with 10 points and 10 assists. Avery Bradley was held to 10 points on 4-of-16 shooting, and Kelly Olynyk provided 13 points, five rebounds and three three-pointers off the bench in 20 minutes.Nikola Vucevic left briefly after a flagrant foul from Tyler Zeller opened up a gash on his forehead requiring eight stitches. Even though it’s a team game, Elfrid Payton bears some responsibility for the loss. He shot 4-of-15 from the free-throw line after the Celtics decided to intentionally foul him in the second half, accounting for 11 of the team’s 14 misses at the charity stripe.

												The Toronto Raptors (39-26) defeated the Miami Heat (29-36) 102-92 on Friday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. The Raptors got out to a quick start in this game, out-scoring the Heat 50-41 right away in the first half. The Raptors shot 43 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Heat finished at 44 percent from the floor and 22 percent from deep. With the win, Toronto moves into a tie with the Chicago Bulls (who lost to the Hornets Friday) for the third projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings, while the Heat drop to a half game behind the Hornets (who beat the Bulls Friday) for the eigth and final projected playoff seed.   Giving the Raptors their biggest contribution was Kyle Lowry, who filled up the stat sheet and came quite close to recording a quadruple-double. He went 7-for-12 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 19 points, while adding eight rebounds, eight assists and seven steals over 37 minutes. It was a season-high in steals for the guard, who's averaging 1.5 steals on the year. Over his last two games, he's combined for 51 points, 12 rebounds, 13 assists and nine steals. Despite shooting pretty poorly from the floor, DeMar DeRozan forced his way to the free throw line and finished with 18 points (3-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 12-13 FT), six rebounds and six assists. He matched a season-high in both free throws made and attempted, and improved his free throw percentage to just over 81 percent on the season. It was the first time he's scored less than 20 points in five games, but the Raptors were still able to grab the win and end their losing streak. Coming off the bench, Louis Williams posted 14 points (4-12 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and four rebounds in 23 minutes. For the Heat, Dwyane Wade continued his impressive stretch for the Heat, as he shot 40 percent or higher from the field for the fifth straight game. Wade went 9-for-13 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 25 points, to go along with four assists. Over his last five games, he's averaging 28.0 points and five assists per matchup. Goran Dragic also had a nice showing and posted 18 points (8-17 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five assists. Since joining the Heat nine games ago, he's averaging 16.2 points, 3.2 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.6 steals per game. Michael Beasley gave the Heat the biggest contribution off the bench, as he recorded 11 points (4-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and nine rebounds over 26 minutes. After playing just 14 minutes in Wednesday's game against the Nets, he got a nice boost in court time, which he was able to convert into his fifth outing in double figures this season. Hassan Whiteside added nine points (4-6 FG, 1-4 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocks while back with the starters. The Raptors' next game will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, while the Heat will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Miami,Heat,Scotiabank Arena,29,36,39,26,12.0,33.0,34.0,79.0,22.0,31.0,43.0,26.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,Terrence Ross,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,20,Luol Deng,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,34,Amir Johnson,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Henry Walker,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,22,Tyler Hansbrough,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Hassan Whiteside,12.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,DeMar DeRozan,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,38,Dwyane Wade,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,9.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,32,Kyle Lowry,8.0,8.0,7.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,37,Goran Dragic,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,38,Patrick Patterson,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,22,Michael Beasley,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,25,James Johnson,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Mario Chalmers,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,30,Greivis Vasquez,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,25,Chris Andersen,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18,Lou Williams,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,22,Tyler Johnson,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,12,Chuck Hayes,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,James Ennis III,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (36-29) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14-50) 113-99 on Friday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. This marked a huge win for the Thunder, who have pulled even with the New Orleans Pelicans for the eigth and final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. They also were able to add some distance between them and the Suns, who remain two and a half games back from both the Thunder and the Pelicans. While both teams shot 44 percent from the field Friday, the Thunder grabbed the advantage from the three-point line, as they finished at 46 percent from beyond the arc, while the Timberwolves struggled to just 25 percent from deep. For the Thunder, Russell Westbrook continues to force his name into MVP talks, as he recorded his sixth triple-double in his last eight games Friday, finishing with 29 points (11-24 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT), 10 rebounds and 12 assists in 35 minutes. While he's clearly the MVP of the second half of the season, most still see James Harden, Stephen Curry and LeBron James as more likely to take home the award. Over his last eight games, Westbrook is averaging a ridiculous 34.3 points, 11.4 rebounds, 10.6 assists and 2.3 steals. Notching one of his best games since joining the Thunder, Enes Kanter recorded 23 points (10-19 FG, 3-3 FT) and 15 rebounds. It was his second double-double in his last three games, a stretch where he's averaged 20.7 points and 10.7 rebounds. With Serge Ibaka sitting out with a knee injury, Mitch McGary moved into the starting lineup and posted an efficient 12 points (6-8 FG) and two rebounds in 22 minutes. It marked his first start of the season, and it was just the fifth time he's reached double-digit points. Anthony Morrow added 13 points (5-11 FG, 3-6 3Pt) and two rebounds off the bench. The Timberwolves were dealing with some injuries coming into this game, as both Kevin Garnett (knee) and Nikola Pekovic (ankle) were out with their respective injuries. Gorgui Dieng filled in as the starting center, while Adreian Payne received the start at power forward. Dieng took advantage of the start, scoring a team-high of 21 points (7-10 FG, 7-8 FT), to go along with 14 rebounds in 42 minutes. It was the first time he's surpassed the 20-point mark since the beginning of January. He also played well on the defensive side of the ball despite the loss, recording two steals and three blocked shots as well. Like Dieng, Andrew Wiggins did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. in 37 minutes, he finished with 19 points (4-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 11-12 FT) and five rebounds. It wasn't his best shooting performance, but he was able to force his way to the free throw line over and over. Jordan Hamilton played 33 minutes off the bench and finished with 17 points (6-10 FG, 5-5 FT), 10 rebounds, three steals and three blocked shots. It was far-and-away his best game of the year, as his point, steal and block totals were all season-highs. The Thunder's next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Sunday, while the Timberwolves will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Sunday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Chesapeake Energy Arena,14,50,36,29,10.0,22.0,43.0,98.0,14.0,14.0,47.0,28.0,14.0,3.0,12.0,34.0,78.0,28.0,31.0,42.0,20.0,20.0,Dion Waiters,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,24,Andrew Wiggins,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,37,Mitch McGary,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Adreian Payne,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Enes Kanter,15.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23.0,10.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,32,Gorgui Dieng,14.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,21.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,42,Andre Roberson,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Kevin Martin,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,26,Russell Westbrook,10.0,12.0,2.0,0.0,29.0,11.0,24.0,3.0,6.0,8.0,35,Ricky Rubio,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,22,Kyle Singler,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,Justin Hamilton,10.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,17.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Steven Adams,9.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Gary Neal,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Anthony Morrow,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,19,Zach LaVine,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,25,D.J.

												The Dallas Mavericks (42-25) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (42-24), 129-99, to tighten the race at the bottom of the Western Conference playoff standings. Chris Paul was assessed a flagrant foul 1 after whacking J.J. Barea across the head on a layup attempt.For just the second time post-All-Star break, Dirk Nowitzki converted more than half his shots in scoring a game-high 22 points. The Mavericks hit an impressive 15 three-pointers to claim half a half game lead over the San Antonio Spurs in the sixth seed. Tyson Chandler managed his first double-double since February 20th, compiling 14 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes. Charlie Villanueva continued his rampage against the Clippers, scoring 19 points after notching a season-high 26 against them in January.DeAndre Jordan hit the first three-pointer of his career, the lone Clippers' highlight in the blowout loss. The 30-point loss won’t help Jordan’s claim to Defensive Player of the Year. Chris Paul, flagrant foul aside, registered 11 points, seven assists and five steals in 33 minutes. Austin Rivers led all reserves with 24 minutes, posting a team low minus 28 plus/minus. The Mavericks, who don’t have a back-to-back stint the rest of the month, get two days off before hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Clippers begin a two-game homestand Sunday against the Houston Rockets.

												The Denver Nuggets (25-41) defeated the Golden State Warriors (51-13) 114-103 on Friday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.With the Warriors resting Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Andrew Bogut and Andre Iguodala, the Nuggets were able to come out and end the Warriors' five-game win streak. Despite the loss, the Warriors remain six and a half games ahead of the Grizzlies for the number one spot in the Western Conference standings. Helping pull off the win for the Nuggets was their shooting, as they went 50 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Warriors finished at 42 percent from the floor and 42 percent from deep. The Nuggets continued to use their small lineup during Friday's game, with Kenneth Faried getting the start at center. He was quite successful this time around, finishing with 24 points (10-18 FG, 4-6 FT) and 17 rebounds in 34 minutes. It marked his second double-double over his last three games, a stretch where he's averaging 19.0 points and 11.0 rebounds, while shooting over 55 percent from the field. Danilo Gallinari matched Faried with 24 points (7-16 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 9-11 FT) of his own, to go along with seven rebounds in 34 minutes. He's on a nice two-game stretch where he's combined for 47 points and 12 rebounds. Randy Foye was the third memeber of the starting lineup to reach the 20-point mark, as he went 6-for-12 from the field and 4-for-9 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while adding eight assists. He's been very inconsistent with his scoring, as he's posted anywhere between three and 20 points over his last five games. Jameer Nelson chipped in with 17 points (7-12 FG, 3-4 3Pt) and seven assists as well.With Curry and Thompson on the bench, Shaun Livingston and Justin Holiday got the start at the guard spots. Holiday finished with a team-high of 23 points (9-16 FG, 5-7 3Pt), while Livingston added 12 points (5-13 FG, 2-2 FT) and eight assists as well. This was just the sixth time Holiday has reached double figures in points this season, and a nice surprise for the Warriors, as he's averaging just 3.6 points on the season. Also helping to keep the Warriors in the game was a couple of their bench players. Rookie James Michael-McAdoo went 6-for-10 from the field and 4-for-6 from the free throw line to score 16 points, to go along with five rebounds in 28 minutes. It was just his fifth game of the season, as he's spent the majority of his time in the NBA D-League since being signed for the rest of the season by the Warriors in mid-February. It was a career-high in points for the guard. Leandro Barbosa chipped in with 14 points (5-13 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and nine assists as well. The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, while the Warriors will be at home against the New York Knicks on Saturday. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Golden State,Warriors,Pepsi Center,51,13,25,41,8.0,17.0,41.0,81.0,24.0,37.0,51.0,23.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Wilson Chandler,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Harrison Barnes,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,24,Danilo Gallinari,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,34,Draymond Green,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,20,Kenneth Faried,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24.0,10.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,David Lee,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,31,Randy Foye,3.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,6.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,34,Justin Holiday,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,9.0,16.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,35,Jameer Nelson,4.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,38,Shaun Livingston,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,JJ Hickson,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Leandro Barbosa,0.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,25,Jusuf Nurkic,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,8,Brandon Rush,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,23,Will Barton,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,Festus Ezeli,6.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Gary Harris,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,James Michael McAdoo,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Erick Green,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Stephen Curry,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Atlanta Hawks (51-14) defeated the Phoenix Suns (34-33) 96-87 on Friday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix. Despite coming out of the third quarter down 73-65, the Hawks lit it up in the fourth, out-scoring the Suns 31-14 to finish the game and steal the nine-point victory on the road in Phoenix. It's a tough loss for the Suns, as that marks their fifth loss over their last ten games. It also pushes them three games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder and New Orleans Pelicans, who sit tied for the eigth and final projected playoff seed in the Western Coference standings. The Hawks, on the other hand, only furthered their already comfortable lead atop the Eastern Conference standings. They now sit 10 games ahead of LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers for the first overall seed. Paul Millsap was a big reason for the Hawks' success. He went 10-for-18 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 23 points, while also adding nine rebounds, three steals and three blocked shots. He's been very impressive on the defensive side of the ball lately, finishing with two or more steals in each of his last six games. He's pushed his season averages to 16.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and three assists. Kyle Korver also played a big factor in the win, finishing with 14 points (5-for-8 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT), four rebounds and two blocked shots. He has been unbelievable shooting the ball over his last three games, combining to go 18-for-25 from the field and 14-for-19 from the three-point line to score 52 points. Coming close to a double-double, Al Horford added 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-2 FT) and seven rebounds in 34 minutes. He dominated Alex len in the post, not only scoring some points on him, but keeping Len scoreless himself in 24 minutes. Both Dennis Schroder and Kent Bazemore reached double figures off the bench with 11 points apiece. While their bench combined for only 15 points, the Suns' starters did plenty of scoring. The Morris twins formed a solid duo at the forward positions. Markieff Morris finished with 22 points (9-18 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-5 FT), six rebounds and five steals, while Marcus Morris posted 18 points (7-18 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and six rebounds. Markieff has posted two impressive games in a row, combining for 46 points on 19-of-33 shooting from the field. Marcus was in the starting lineup, as P.J. Tucker shifted down to a guard position with Brandon Knight sitting out with an ankle injury. Eric Bledsoe did his best to make up for the loss of Knight as well. He went 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 21 points, to go along with six assists. He did have seven turnovers though, as he was a little sloppy in the loss. Tucker added 11 points (4-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and nine rebounds. The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, while the Suns will be at home against the New York Knicks on Sunday. 											",Phoenix,Suns,Atlanta,Hawks,Talking Stick Resort Arena,51,14,34,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Marcus Morris Sr.,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,18.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,36,DeMarre Carroll,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,31,Markieff Morris,7.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,22.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,39,Paul Millsap,9.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,23.0,10.0,18.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,36,Alex Len,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Al Horford,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,P.J.

												The Indiana Pacers (30-34) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (34-31) ,109-103, on Thursday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. In a matchup between the East's sixth and seventh seeds, Milwaukee and Indiana went back and forth all the way through overtime, but the Pacers outlasted the Bucks. Milwaukee went on an 11-2 run to cut the Pacers' lead from 10 to one midway through the fourth quarter. From there, Milwaukee had an answer every time Indiana tried to pull away. Ersan Ilyasova had his 11th point of the fourth quarter to tie it at 96, but couldn't convert the second free throw to give Milwaukee the lead. Luis Scola was huge off the bench with 17 points and 15 rebounds, including a jumper that helped spark a 9-0 Pacers run in overtime. Indiana has taken two out of three in the season series with Milwaukee. They will meet for the final time in the regular season in two weeks.Milwaukee faltered in overtime to drop the second half of a back-to-back set. Michael Carter-Williams had his best game as a member of the Bucks with 28 points, 12 rebounds, and two steals. O.J Mayo and Jerryd Bayless were both sidelined for this contest, which allowed Tyler Ennis to play 15 minutes, although he only managed six points and four assists in that span. Milwaukee returns to action Saturday in Memphis.The Pacers have now won a season-high seven games in a row and nine of their last ten. Roy Hibbert was sidelined with an elbow injury, but Ian Mahinmi filled in admirably as the rim protector. Mahinmi finished with 10 boards and four blocks in 29 minutes before fouling out in overtime. Rodney Stuckey continued his scoring tear with a team-high 23 points in 37 minutes off the bench. The Pacers resume play Saturday when they host the Celtics.

												The Washington Wizards (37-28) took advantage of a short-handed Memphis Grizzlies team (45-20) Thursday with an easy 107-87 win at the Verizon Center.Memphis rested Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, and Marc Gasol on Thursday after taking a tough 95-92 loss in Boston on Wednesday. The Grizzlies more than competed with the Wizards in the early going, taking a 33-26 lead into the second quarter. The Wizards woke up in the second quarter, however, outscoring the Grizzlies 34-14 in the period to take a commanding lead. Washington's Marcin Gortat was dominant with 22 points, nine rebounds, three blocks, and three steals as the Wizards cruised to their second straight 20-point victory. Memphis has fallen back to earth a little bit after losing three of its last four games. The absence of Conley, Randolph, and Gasol was apparent as the Grizzlies shot just 38 percent from the floor. JaMychal Green stepped into the starting lineup at power forward and posted a team-high 13 points on 6-of-11 shooting. The Grizzlies will look to bounce back at home Saturday when they host the Bucks. Washington was missing one of its front court starters as well with Nene Hilario sat out for personal reasons. The Wizards used their big lead to give some minutes to their role players. Ramon Sessions and Otto Porter got the most time off the bench, playing 27 and 28 minutes respectively and combining for 15 points, 12 rebounds, and seven assists. Washington will return to action Saturday when Sacramento comes to the Verizon Center.

												The Utah Jazz (28-36) handled to Houston Rockets (43-21), 109-91, on Thursday at the EnergySolutions Arena. Utah's Rudy Gobert continued to show why the Jazz were comfortable jettisoning Enes Kanter at the trade deadline. The ""Stifle Tower"" had 19 points to go with 22 rebounds (12 of the offensive variety) and four blocks in just 36 minutes. The Jazz flustered James Harden all night, holding the MVP candidate to just 15 points on 3 of 13 shooting. The Jazz will have a chance to even the season series with the Rockets at two when they square off on the final day of the regular season.  Houston was coming off a hard fought loss in Portland on Wednesday and came out flat against Utah. The Rockets were pushed around on the glass as they were out-rebounded by 20 for the second night in a row. The lone bright spot was Corey Brewer, who led the team in scoring for the second straight night, scoring 25 points. The Rockets have a couple days off to recover before finishing up their four-game road trip Sunday against the Clippers.Utah looked completely different Thursday than it did when it struggled to hold off New York on Tuesday. The Jazz held the high flying Rockets to just 43 first-half points and paired that with their highest point total since Jan. 30 against Golden State where they scored 110. Gordon Hayward was back in the fold for the Jazz after being held out of Tuesday's game with back soreness. Hayward shined in his return with 29 points on 10-of-17 shooting and Rodney Hood posted a career-high 20 points. The Jazz will look to extend their winning streak to five when they host the Pistons on Saturday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Houston,Rockets,Vivint Smart Home Arena,43,22,28,36,11.0,33.0,44.0,92.0,10.0,17.0,57.0,23.0,12.0,7.0,31.0,34.0,77.0,16.0,24.0,34.0,18.0,9.0,Gordon Hayward,4.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,10.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,31,Trevor Ariza,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,30,Derrick Favors,8.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,28,Terrence Jones,10.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,23,Rudy Gobert,22.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,19.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Donatas Motiejunas,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,23,Rodney Hood,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,16.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,32,James Harden,4.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,15.0,3.0,13.0,0.0,5.0,3.0,34,Dante Exum,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,33,Patrick Beverley,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,23,Elijah Millsap,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,11,Jason Terry,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,19,Trey Burke,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,22,Josh Smith,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,14,Trevor Booker,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,Corey Brewer,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,10.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,32,Joe Ingles,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,24,Joey Dorsey,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Jeremy Evans,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Pablo Prigioni,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (42-25) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (40-24), 128-125 in a thriller on Thursday at the AT&T Center. When Tony Parker sunk a mid-range jumper to put the Spurs up six with just over 30 seconds remaining, it looked like the final nail in the Cavaliers' coffin. Kyrie Irving then answered with two three-pointers, including a buzzer-beater, to send it into overtime. The Cavaliers needed every bit of Irving's 16 fourth quarter points to force the extra frame, and he didn't stop there. He was a perfect 7-for-7 from beyond the arc on his way to a career-high 57 points. 27 of Irving's points came in the fourth quarter and overtime as he led Cleveland back to an improbable win in San Antonio. The Spurs hadn't lost in March since 2013. The Cavaliers notched a signature win on the road Thursday thanks to Kyrie Irving's unbelievable individual effort. LeBron James' 31 points, seven assists, and five rebounds were crucial as well as he and Irving accounted for over two-thirds of Cleveland's points. Kevin Love had a quiet night with just eight points and five rebounds after posting two consecutive double-doubles. The Cavaliers have a couple days off after Thursday's marathon before returning to action Sunday in Orlando. The Spurs rarely end up on the losing end when they have a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, but it happened Thursday night to snap their six game winning streak. It's even more rare when you consider that the Spurs shot 56 percent from the floor. Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard had tremendous outings with 31 and 24 points respectively, but Kyrie Irving and the Cavaliers proved to be too much in the end. Kawhi Leonard had two rare misses at the free throw line to give the Cavaliers a chance at the end of the fourth. The Spurs are off until Sunday when they host the Timberwolves.

												The New York Knicks (13-51) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (17-47) 101-94 on Thursday at the Staples Center. It's rare to see the Lakers and Knicks match up this late in the season with a combined winning percentage under 30, but that's the way this season is going for both teams. Tim Hardaway Jr. hit a three pointer to give the Knicks a 46-45 lead that they would retain for the rest of the game. Hardaway led the way for the Knicks with 22 points, including 5-for-7 on three pointers, as they notched their first win in the month of March. The Lakers New York won just its third game since the All-Star break despite a -18 rebound margin. Hardaway Jr. was excellent in his return after missing two games with back spasms. Alexey Shved was in the starting lineup again on Thursday and finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. The Knicks continue their five-game Western Conference road trip on Saturday against the Warriors. Los Angeles was unable to maintain the momentum from Tuesday's win over Detroit as it fell to New York for the second and final time this season. Jordan Hill led the way with 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Ed Davis added 10 boards off the bench, but it wasn't enough for the Lakers to close the gap. The Lakers are off until Sunday when they host the Hawks.  											",Los Angeles,Lakers,New York,Knicks,Staples Center,13,51,17,47,5.0,18.0,38.0,90.0,13.0,21.0,51.0,18.0,13.0,9.0,18.0,36.0,77.0,20.0,26.0,33.0,27.0,8.0,Wesley Johnson,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,32,Lance Thomas,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Jordan Hill,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,28,Lou Amundson,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Tarik Black,11.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Andrea Bargnani,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,32,Wayne Ellington,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,28,Alexey Shved,11.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,33,Jordan Clarkson,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,27,Langston Galloway,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,25,Jeremy Lin,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,22,Cleanthony Early,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,23,Carlos Boozer,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,Cole Aldrich,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Ed Davis,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Jason Smith,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,23,Jabari Brown,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,17,Tim Hardaway Jr.,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,14.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,31,Ryan Kelly,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Shane Larkin,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13

												The Sacramento Kings (22-41) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (28-35) 113-106 on Wednesday in Charlotte.It was a close game after the third quarter, but a strong final period from the Kings led them to victory. Sacramento's winning effort was lead by Ben McLemore, who scored a season-high 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting in 41 minutes. Rudy Gay followed close behind, scoring 26 points on 9-of-17 shooting in 28 minutes. DeMarcus Cousins recorded his fifth straight double-double and his sixth in seven games, scoring 20 points on 8-of-17 shooting and grabbing 14 rebounds in 34 minutes. Over those last seven games, Cousins has averaged 17.7 points and 10.0 rebounds. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist led the way for the Hornets in the losing effort, scoring 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting to go along with nine rebounds in 32 minutes. Kemba Walker returned to action for Charlotte after being out with a knee injury since late-January, playing just 16 minutes and scoring six points on 2-of-9 shooting in that time. While Walker still works his way back into the rotation, Mo Williams continues to start. He recorded 20 points on 8-of-20 shooting and eight assists in 38 minutes. Gerald Henderson also put together a nice stat line, recording 17 points, 11 assists, and six rebounds in 34 minutes. The loss puts the Hornets a half-game behind the Miami Heat and out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture for now. Up next, the Kings will head to Philadelphia Friday to take on the 76ers, while Charlotte will stay home to go up against the Bulls on Friday. 											",Charlotte,Hornets,Sacramento,Kings,Spectrum Center,22,41,28,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,9.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,23.0,9.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Rudy Gay,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,9.0,17.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,38,Marvin Williams,7.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,4.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,32,Carl Landry,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Al Jefferson,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,DeMarcus Cousins,14.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,34,Gerald Henderson,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,34,Ben McLemore,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,27.0,10.0,16.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,40,Mo Williams,2.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,8.0,20.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,38,Ray McCallum,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,25,Kemba Walker,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,16,Omri Casspi,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,18,Bismack Biyombo,6.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Derrick Williams,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,23,Jason Maxiell,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Jason Thompson,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Lance Stephenson,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,25,Andre Miller,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,25,Troy Daniels,,,,,,,,,,,,Reggie Evans,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Chicago Bulls (40-26) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (14-50) 104-95 on Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia .With 43 seconds left in the game, Jerami Grant went to the free throw line and converted on both of his attempts to put the Sixers up by three. Aaron Brooks then went on to hit a three-pointer to tie the game at 92 with just over 30 seconds left in regulation. Luc Mbah A Moute had a shot to win it for the Sixers at the buzzer, but he missed and forced the game into overtime. Once overtime started though, the Bulls didn't look back, as they out-scored the Sixers 12-3 and finished the game with a nine-point win on the road in Philadelphia.Including the clutch three-point shot that helped the Bulls extend this game to overtime, Brooks also went on to post a team-high of 31 points (12-20 FG, 3-7 3PT, 4-6 FT), to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He has now shot over 40 percent from the field in three games straight, a stretch where he's averaged 22.7 points and four assists per game. Also playing a big factor in the win was Pau Gasol. Gasol went 13-for-25 from the field for 27 points, while adding a team-high of 16 rebounds in 43 minutes. The double-double marked his six straight, while he's posted 10 or more rebounds in each of his last 10 games as well. On the season, he's pushed his averages to 18.1 points and 12.1 rebounds per game. Notching a double-double of his own, Nikola Mirotic finished with 16 points (5-13 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and 12 rebounds as a member of the starting lineup. Joakim Noah had to sit out with an injury, forcing Gasol to move center, which opened a spot up for Mirotic at power forward. He's combined for 34 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games. The only other Bull to reach double figures in points was Tony Snell, who recorded 10 points (2-9 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 45 minutes.With Isaiah Canaan dealing with an illness, the Sixers decided to bring him off the bench, while inserting Ish Smith as a starter. It was a successful switch for this team, as each scored 20 or more points despite the loss. Smith went off for 23 points (9-21 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six assists in 37 minutes. The points were a new season-high for the guard, as it marked just the fourth time he's reached double-digits in points. Canaan, on the other hand, went 7-for-15 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line for 20 points in 29 minutes off the bench, as his illness didn't seem to limit him much. While his season averages sit at 8.1 points and 1.8 rebounds per game, he's received many more opportunities since joining the Sixers at the trade deadline. Over 10 games with the Sixers, he's averaging 14.2 points and 3.5 assists. Nerlens Noel didn't do all too much offensively and posted just eight points, but he did chip in with 15 rebounds, four steals and two blocked shots in 36 minutes. Coming off the bench, Robert Covington added 12 points (5-13 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 1-3 FT) in 21 minutes off the bench.The Sixers' next game will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Friday, while the Bulls will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Friday.

												The Boston Celtics (27-36) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (45-19) 95-92 on Wednesday in Boston. The Grizzlies' Mike Conley had a chance to tie the game at the end with a 28-foot three point jumper, but it was off and the Celtics were able to pull off the upset without their main contributor off the bench, Isaiah Thomas (back). Boston was lead by Avery Bradley, who missed the last three games with an elbow injury. Bradley had 17 points on 8-of-17 shooting and five rebounds in 34 minutes.Bradley's return to the starting lineup sent Jae Crowder back to the bench, and Crowder once again thrived in the role, scoring 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting in 28 minutes. Kelly Olynyk also contributed 15 points in 20 minutes off the bench. Tyler Zeller (12) and Brandon Bass (12) round out the Celtics players who scored in double figures. The victory pushes Boston to just one-game behind the eighth-place Hornets for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Despite his last-second miss, Conley still lead the way for Memphis in the losing effort, scoring 20 points on 9-of-12 shooting. Tony Allen contributed 16 points and five rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench.Marc Gasol struggled to get anything going Monday, as he scored just nine points on 4-of-9 shooting to go with seven rebounds and has failed to score in double figures in two of his last three games. As a team, the Grizzlies struggled to take care of the ball recording 21 turnovers to go with just 21 assists. But, despite the loss, Memphis still sits in second place in the Western Conference with a 1.5-game lead over the third-place Rockets.Up next, the Grizzlies will travel to Washington Thursday to take on the Wizards, while the Celtics will stay home and go up against the Magic on Friday.  											",Boston,Celtics,Memphis,Grizzlies,TD Garden,45,19,27,36,8.0,27.0,37.0,85.0,13.0,17.0,36.0,28.0,16.0,5.0,12.0,37.0,75.0,13.0,13.0,40.0,19.0,20.0,Evan Turner,0.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Jeff Green,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,31,Brandon Bass,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,32,Zach Randolph,8.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,Tyler Zeller,9.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Marc Gasol,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Avery Bradley,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,17.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,34,Courtney Lee,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,26,Marcus Smart,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,33,Mike Conley,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,33,Jae Crowder,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,27,Tony Allen,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,16.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,Kelly Olynyk,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,19,JaMychal Green,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Phil Pressey,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,17,Kosta Koufos,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Gigi Datome,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9,Beno Udrih,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,15,Jonas Jerebko,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,15,Vince Carter,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9

												The Miami Heat (29-35) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (25-38) 104-98 on Wednesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.The Heat got out to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Nets 34-23 right away in the first quarter. The Nets made a fourth quarter push to bring it within five, but the Heat had established too large of a lead early in the game that the Nets came up just short. The Heat finished at 46 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets shot 44 percent from the floor and 35 percent from deep. What really made the difference though was turnovers. The Heat forced the Nets into 21 turnovers, while committing just 11 of their own.Dwyane Wade did the bulk of the shooting in this one, going 10-for-25 from the field and 8-for-11 from the free throw line for a game-high of 28 points, while also adding nine assists and two steals. He's playing some of his best basketball of the season right now, averaging 28.8 points over his last four games. With Hassan Whiteside sitting out due to suspension, Chris Andersen moved into the starting lineup at center. He was very efficient with his time, finishing with 18 points (8-9 FG, 2-4 FT) and 14 rebounds in 29 minutes. It was far-and-away his best game of the year so far, as it marked a new season-high in points, along with being his first double-double of the year. He's averaging just 5.4 points and five rebounds on the season. Also playing a big factor in the win was Goran Dragic, who made his return to the court after missing two games with a back injury. In 35 minutes, Dragic posted 17 points (5-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 6-9 FT), three assists and two steals. Considering he played a full 35 minutes, he should be over the back injury moving forward.Doing their best to keep the Nets close was the duo of Deron Williams and Jarrett Jack. Williams finished with 18 points (6-10 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT), four assists and two steals, while Jack posted 18 points (5-8 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 7-8 FT), four rebounds and four assists of his own. Despite coming off the bench, Jack has remained quite effective and has now combined for 33 points and seven assists over his last two games. He's also shot over 50 percent in each of his last three games. Starting at center, Brook Lopez recorded 15 points (6-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes. He has now posted three double-doubles over his last four games, a stretch where he's averaging 17.0 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. Coming close to a double-double of his own, Thaddeus Young finished with 15 points (6-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT), seven rebounds and two steals. Since joining the Nets 11 games ago, Young has averaged 13.0 points and 4.7 rebounds, but he's starting to get more and more comfortable, so we could see his numbers on the rise again soon.The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Friday, while the Nets will travel to Philadelphia to play the 76ers on Saturday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (34-30) defeated the Orlando Magic (21-45) on Wednesday in Milwaukee. A 6-0 run over the last 1:30 of the game sealed the deal for the Bucks, who were once again led by Khris Middleton, who scored a game-high 30 points on 12-of-17 shooting. Middleton has now scored 30 points in two of his last three outings. Zaza Pachulia recorded a double-double, putting up 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting and 12 rebounds in 24 minutes. Michael Carter-Williams also stuffed the stat sheet as he starts to grow more comfortable in Milwaukee's offense, recording 11 points, nine rebounds, and six assists in 34 minutes. All five of Milwaukee's starter scored in double figures, with Ersan Ilyasova (12) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (11) rounding out the five.The Bucks recorded 30 assists on 39 made field goals, and the win brings them within two games of the Wizards for fifth place in the Eastern Conference.Nikola Vucevic had a double-double for the Magic in the losing effort, recording 19 points on 9-of-20 shooting and 14 rebounds in 39 minutes. Victor Oladipo struggled shooting the ball for the second straight game, putting up 14 points on 4-of-17 shooting and six assists in 39 minutes. Oladipo has now shot 8-for-29 in his last two outings. Tobias Harris (17), Elfrid Payton (14), and Channing Frye (13) round out the Orlando players who scored in double figures.Up next, the Bucks will travel to Indiana Thursday to take on the Pacers, while the Magic head to Boston to go up against the Celtics. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Orlando,Magic,Fiserv Forum,21,45,34,30,8.0,17.0,38.0,77.0,11.0,16.0,48.0,29.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,Giannis Antetokounmpo,7.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,30,Tobias Harris,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,39,Ersan Ilyasova,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,25,Dewayne Dedmon,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Zaza Pachulia,12.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Nikola Vucevic,14.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,9.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,38,Khris Middleton,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,30.0,12.0,17.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,41,Victor Oladipo,1.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,17.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,39,Michael Carter-Williams,9.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,34,Elfrid Payton,2.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,35,O.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (42-23) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (35-29) 120-108 on Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.The Clippers were able to come out and have a good start to this game, out-scoring the Thunder 36-30 in the first quarter, while grabbing a 65-57 lead by half. They came into the third quarter playing just as well and were able to use that momentum to coast to the 12-point victory on the road in Oklahoma City. The Clippers were the superior shooters, going 46 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Thunder finished at 43 percent from the floor and 48 percent from deep. What ultimately may have made the difference was turnovers though, as the Clippers forced the Thunder into 20, while committing just 14 of their own.Despite coming into this game questionable with a knee injury, Chris Paul showed no signs of being slowed down and recorded a game-high of 33 points (11-19 FG, 5-8 3Pt, 6-7 FT), to go along with nine assists and two steals. He struggled to just two points on 1-of-6 shooting during Monday's game against the Timberwolves, so it was good to see him return to form and have a ton of success on the offensive side of the ball. J.J. Redick continued to stay hot as well, finishing with 25 points (6-14 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 10-10 FT), seven assists and three steals in 35 minutes. He's really stepped up his game in the absence of Jamal Crawford, as Redick is averaging 22.6 points and 1.4 steals over his last five games. He's pushed his season scoring average to 15.1 points per game. Matt Barnes was dialed in as well, going 6-for-7 from the three-point line for 22 points, while also adding three steals and two blocked shots. It marked just the third time he's surpassed the 20-point mark so far this season. Adding another double-double to his season totals, DeAndre Jordan posted 18 points (3-7 FG, 12-22 FT) and 17 rebounds, despite missing 10 free throws over the course of the game.Coming quite close to recording another triple-double, Russell Westbrook finished with 24 points (5-14 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 11-13 FT), nine rebounds and seven assists in 36 minutes. He did have 10 turnovers though, which may have overshawdowed his performance a bit. He's still one of the hottest players in the country right now and is averaging 35.0 points, 11.6 rebounds and 10.4 assists over his last seven games, a stretch that includes an unheard of five triple-doubles. He's pushed his season averages to 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 8.3 assists on the year. Doing his best to help keep the Thunder alive as well, Anthony Morrow added a team-high of 26 points (8-12 FG, 6-9 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 36 minutes off the bench, to go along with three rebounds and three steals. It was the first time he's surpassed the 20-point mark this season, giving himself a new season-high in points. Both Enes Kanter and Serge Ibaka reached double figures in points as well. Kanter finished with 18 points (6-12 FG, 6-9 FT) and five rebounds, while Ibaka posted 15 points (6-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and three rebounds.The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Denver Nuggets (24-41) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (50-14) 115-102 on Wednesday in Denver. The final score makes the game appear a lot closer than it actually was, as Denver was in full control for the entire game, and a big fourth quarter from the Atlanta reserves closed the gap a bit.The Nuggets were lead by Danilo Gallinari, who scored 23 points on 8-of-12 shooting and grabbed five rebounds in just 24 minutes. Kenneth Faried played just 21 minutes and scored 14 points on 6-of-7 shooting to go along with five rebounds and four blocks in that time. Ty Lawson struggled shooting the ball, scoring just five points on 8-of-12 shooting, but was able to dish out nine assists. Jameer Nelson didn't play much off the bench, logging just 13 minutes, but scored 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting in that time. Will Barton (16), Randy Foye (11), J.J. Hickson (10), and Darrell Arthur (10) round out the seven Denver players who scored in double figures.It was an uncharacteristic night for the Hawks, as they could not get anything going offensively from the get-go. Al Horford finished with six points, scoring in single figures for the first time in nine games, while Teague scored eight points and was held to single figures for the first time since late December. Kyle Korver led Atlanta in the losing effort, scoring 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting. As a team, the Hawks had just 18 assists to 17 turnovers, but still hold a massive 10-game lead for first place in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Nuggets will stay home and take on the Warriors on Friday, while Atlanta will travel to Phoenix Friday to go up against the Suns. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Atlanta,Hawks,Pepsi Center,50,14,24,41,13.0,27.0,42.0,78.0,17.0,19.0,40.0,28.0,15.0,7.0,23.0,29.0,73.0,23.0,25.0,27.0,16.0,15.0,Wilson Chandler,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,26,DeMarre Carroll,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,21,Danilo Gallinari,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,12.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,23,Paul Millsap,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,25,Kenneth Faried,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,14.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Al Horford,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Randy Foye,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,18,Kyle Korver,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,6.0,8.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,25,Ty Lawson,4.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,27,Jeff Teague,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,23,JJ Hickson,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Pero Antic,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,19,Jameer Nelson,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,13,Kent Bazemore,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,22,Will Barton,6.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,16.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,32,Mike Scott,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,17,Darrell Arthur,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Dennis Schroder,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,19,Erick Green,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,12,Shelvin Mack,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,20

												The Phoenix Suns (34-32) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14-49) 106-97 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25-18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc.The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team-high of 24 points (10-15 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce-back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1-of-8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15.1 points and 5.8 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes.Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5-for-8 from the field and 6-for-7 from the free throw line to score a team-high of 16 points. After shooting just 25 percent (2-8 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday. In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7-for-12 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 2.8 points per game and has reached double-digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3-9 FG, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds. Andrew Wiggins didn't have much of an impact either, as he also had just 10 points (5-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and four rebounds.The Suns' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Friday.

												The Golden State Warriors (51-12) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23-40) 105-98 on Wednesday in Oakland. The Warriors were able to open up their lead in the fourth quarter behind Klay Thompson, who finished with 27 points on 11-of-19 shooting. Thompson's running mate in the backcourt, MVP-candidate Stephen Curry, struggled shooting the ball in the victory and finished with just nine points on 11-of-10 shooting, but was still able to dish out 11 assists. Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut combined for a solid effort in the frontcourt, putting together 25 points and 13 rebounds between the two of them. Andre Iguodala (13), Marreese Speights (12), and Leandro Barbosa (10) all scored in double figures off the bench for Golden State. The win brings the Warriors' lead as the one-seed in the Western Conference to a commanding 6.5 games.Andre Drummond was a force in the paint for the Pistons in the losing effort, scoring 22 points on 11-of-25 shooting and grabbing 27 rebounds, 17 of them offensive, in 34 minutes. Greg Monroe also had a solid outing, recording 20 points on 7-of-18 shooting and nine rebounds in 32 minutes. After having just two points and three assists in his last outing, Reggie Jackson bounced back to put up 14 points on 7-of-15 shooting and nine assists. Caron Butler replaced Tayshaun Prince in the starting lineup, but only scored four points in 20 minutes.The loss further hurts Detroit's already slim playoff chances, as they currently sit six games behind the eighth-place Miami Heat.Up next, the Warriors will head to Denver Friday to take on the Nuggets, while the Pistons will travel to Portland Friday to go up against the TrailBlazers. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Detroit,Pistons,Chase Center,23,41,51,12,,,,,,,,,,4.0,12.0,42.0,98.0,10.0,12.0,49.0,18.0,13.0,Harrison Barnes,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,22,Caron Butler,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Draymond Green,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,31,Greg Monroe,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,20.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,31,Andrew Bogut,6.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Andre Drummond,25.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,22.0,11.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,Klay Thompson,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,27.0,11.0,19.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,34,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,35,Stephen Curry,5.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,15.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,33,Reggie Jackson,2.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,30,Andre Iguodala,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,28,Tayshaun Prince,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Marreese Speights,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Cartier Martin,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,19,Jodie Meeks,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,24,Shaun Livingston,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Spencer Dinwiddie,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,17,Festus Ezeli,,,,,,,,,,,,Anthony Tolliver,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6

												The Portland Trail Blazers (42-20) defeated the Houston Rockets (43-21) 105-100 on Wednesday at the Moda Center in Portland.While the Blazers looked to be in control and destined for a win in the closing few minutes of the fourth quarter, the Rockets came back in a hurry and made it a real interesting finish. With 15 seconds left in the game, Corey Brewer was able to grab a steal and score a bucket to bring the game within one point. Damian Lillard then went on to hit two free throws to put the Blazers back up three. With 12 seconds left, the Rockets had the ball and gave it to Corey Brewer, who launched a three-pointer in an attempt to tie the game, but came up just short and the Rockets went on to fall to the Blazers.Coming into this matchup just a game back from the Rockets for the third spot in the Western Conference standings, this was a big win for the Blazers, as this pulled the two teams even in the standings. Leading the charge was LaMarcus Aldridge, who posted a game-high of 26 points (12-20 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT), while also posting 14 rebounds in 33 minutes. It marked the fifth time in his last sixth games surpassing the 20-point mark, a six-game stretch where he's averaging 24.7 points and 12.3 rebounds. Aldridge did receive some help though, as Nicolas Batum went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while adding nine rebounds and six assists as well. He's dialed in at the moment and has shot 50 percent or higher from the field in each of his last four games. Over those four games, he's averaging 17.5 points and 8.8 rebounds. Notching a double-double, Robin Lopez finished with 16 points (7-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and 10 rebounds in 30 minutes. It marked his first double-double since the start of February.The Rockets received their biggest boost from their bench, with Corey Brewer recording a team-high of 23 points (9-16 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-5 FT), while also adding two steals in 25 minutes. 17 of his 23 points came in the fourth quarter, as he nearly self-propelled the Rockets to a comeback win. James Harden finished with 18 points (7-19 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-5 FT), six assists and three steals in 38 minutes. Over his last three games, he's averaging 28.0 points and 8.3 assists, which included the triple-double he posted against Detroit on Friday. Terrence Jones posted a double-double of his own, with 17 points (6-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and 12 rebounds.

												The Indiana Pacers (29-34) defeated the Orlando Magic (21-44) 118-86 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. In an all-around dominant performance, the Pacers used a strong second half, where they out-scored the Magic 59-39, to finish off the 32-point victory in front of their home crowd. They shot extremely well in this one, going 53 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic finished at just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 24 percent from deep. With the Pacers hitting 13 more three-pointers than the Magic, they had little to no chance of making a comeback Tuesday. The Pacers got a ridiculous amount of production from their bench, as their bench out-scored the Magics 73-18. That effort was led by Rodney Stuckey, who went 13-for-19 from the field and 6-for-9 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 34 points, while also adding six rebounds and seven assists. It was a new season-high in points for the guard, who's now averaging 18.5 points and 4.3 assists over his last six games. Joining Stuckey off the bench was Luis Scola, who recorded 15 points (6-8 FG, 3-3 FT) and 10 rebounds in just 20 minutes. It marked just his fourth double-double of the season and first since the start of February. He's now averaging 9.2 points and 6.2 rebounds on the year. Making just his second career start, Damjan Rudez was forced into the starting lineup, after CJ Miles was a late scratch with a foot injury. He took advantage of the start, hitting nearly everything he shot and finished with 17 points (6-8 FG, 5-7 3Pt), to go along with five assists. It marked just his sixth time this season reaching double-digit points. George Hill added 13 points (5-14 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and six assists as well.Doing the best he could to keep the Magic close in this game was Tobias Harris, who went off for 22 points (8-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 5-6 FT), six rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes. He's picked his game up of late, and is averaging 20.7 points and 5.3 rebounds over his last three games. Victor Oladipo struggled offensively in this one, and scored just 13 points (4-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT), while adding three steals and three blocked shots. He recorded over 20 points in each of his last four games, so it was a disappointing performance for the guard. Rookie Elfrid Payton was in double figures for his third straight game, as he finished with 14 points (5-13 FG, 4-6 FT), to go along with six assists. Over that three-game stretch, he's averaging 14.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 8.3 assists, as he's done a little bit of everything for the Magic during that span. Nikola Vucevic chipped in with 13 points (6-10 FG, 1-2 FT) and five rebounds as well. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday, while the Magic will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Wednesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (36-29) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (25-37) 111-91 on Tuesday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Using a big second quarter, where they outscored the Nets 32-19, the Pelicans were able to pick up a large enough lead by halftime that they could coast to an easy 20-point victory on the road in Brooklyn. They shot extremely well in this game, going 52 percent from the field and 57 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets shot 42 percent from the floor and 38 percent from deep. This was another big win for the Pelicans, who have now pulled themselves even with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. Despite securing the win, the Pelicans received a scare in the fourth quarter, as superstar Anthony Davis went to the locker room with an apparent injury to his head or face. While it may be concerning he never returned to the game, the Pelicans did have a substantial lead at that time, so they could have just been resting him. We should find out more during the after hours of this game. Before leaving, he finished with 15 points (5-16 FG, 5-6 FT), six rebounds and three blocked shots. Norris Cole entered the starting lineup Tuesday, with Tyreke Evans sitting out due to an ankle injury. Cole took advantage of the start and posted 16 points (6-11 FG, 4-6 3Pt), four assists and three steals in 29 minutes. Since joining the Pelicans 11 games ago, he's averaged 10.6 points, 2.1 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game. Quincy Pondexter had another positive showing and scored 17 points (6-9 FG, 5-6 3Pt), to go along with four assists. He had failed to reach double-digit points in six straight games, so it was good to see him get back on track offensively Tuesday. The Pelicans also got a boost from their bench, as Alexis Ajinca finished with 17 points (7-14 FG, 3-3 FT), five rebounds and four assists in just 23 minutes.Continuing to run with the starters, Brook Lopez recorded 15 points (7-14 FG, 1-4 FT), nine rebounds and three blocked shots in 25 minutes. He came just shy of posting his third double-double in a row, as he's averaging 17.7 points and 10.7 rebounds over his last three games. Also doing his best to keep the Nets in this game was Jarrett Jack, who came off the bench for 15 points (5-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and three assists. He looked to be the more effective guard for the Nets tonight, as Deron Williams (3-10 FG, 0-2 3Pt 4-4 FT) struggled to just 10 points. Also struggling offensively was Thaddeus Young, who finished with 10 points (4-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and six rebounds in 27 minutes. He had shot over 50 percent in nine out of his last ten games prior to Tuesday, but has now shot under 40 percent in two out of his last three. Also off the bench, Bojan Bogdanovic added 12 points (5-7 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and an assist in just 17 minutes.    The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday, while the Nets will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Wednesday. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,New Orleans,Pelicans,Barclays Center,36,29,25,37,6.0,15.0,35.0,82.0,15.0,23.0,36.0,17.0,11.0,12.0,21.0,44.0,86.0,9.0,11.0,41.0,31.0,10.0,Joe Johnson,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,27,Quincy Pondexter,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,9.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,29,Thaddeus Young,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,27,Anthony Davis,6.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,15.0,5.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Brook Lopez,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,15.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Omer Asik,15.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Markel Brown,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Eric Gordon,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,14.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,30,Deron Williams,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,25,Norris Cole,5.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,29,Bojan Bogdanovic,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,17,Dante Cunningham,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Jarrett Jack,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,28,Alexis Ajinca,5.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,22,Alan Anderson,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,Elliot Williams,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,16,Cory Jefferson,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Jimmer Fredette,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,14,Mason Plumlee,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Luke Babbitt,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (41-25) routed the Dallas Mavericks (41-25) 127-94 on Tuesday at the American Airlines Center. After being outscored 31-26 in the first quarter, Cleveland dominated the final three frames to notch a convincing win over a Western Conference opponent. Four out of Cleveland's five starters reached 20 points on the night, led by LeBron James' 27. Dallas was held to 41 points in the second half as Cleveland avenged it's January loss at home to the Mavericks. Cleveland has gotten back on track after Friday's loss in Atlanta with two straight wins over Western Conference opponents. Kyrie Irving finished with 22 points and J.R Smith hit five of his eight attempts from beyond the arc on his way to scoring 21 points. The Cavaliers have three games left on its current four-game road trip, with their next game coming Thursday against the Spurs. Dallas's recent struggles resumed Tuesday after Sunday's win over the Lakers. The Mavericks didn't get much production from their starters, with Dirk Nowitzki going 3-of-10 from the field and Rajon Rondo managing just four points and three assists over 24 minutes. Al-Farouq Aminu injured his shoulder in the first half and did not return. The Mavericks will look to shake off this loss on Friday when they hosts the Clippers. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Cleveland,Cavaliers,American Airlines Center,41,25,41,25,5.0,16.0,32.0,75.0,21.0,27.0,38.0,17.0,14.0,15.0,30.0,44.0,84.0,24.0,29.0,48.0,25.0,12.0,Chandler Parsons,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,31,LeBron James,7.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,27.0,10.0,14.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,28,Dirk Nowitzki,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,28,Kevin Love,14.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,17.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,32,Tyson Chandler,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Timofey Mozgov,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,17.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Monta Ellis,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,17.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,31,JR Smith,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,28,Rajon Rondo,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,24,Kyrie Irving,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,34,Al-Farouq Aminu,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,Iman Shumpert,4.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,31,Amar'e Stoudemire,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Matthew Dellavedova,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Devin Harris,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20,Tristan Thompson,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11,Richard Jefferson,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,19,James Jones,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,11,J.J.

												The San Antonio Spurs (40-39) defeated the Toronto Raptors (38-26) 117-107 on Tuesday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.The Spurs got out to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Raptors 28-17 in the first quarter, while gathering a 61-41 lead by half. The Raptors tried to make a run in the second half, but the Spurs built up a big enough lead early, that the Raptors weren't able to overcome it. The Spurs finished at 48 percent from the field and a ridiculous 61 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors went 44 percent from the floor and just 31 percent from deep. The Spurs also converted on 24-of-30 attempts from the free throw line, while the Raptors made just 13-of-18, which also made a huge difference in the win.The Spurs were led by Kawhi Leonard, who posted 24 points (10-19 FG, 4-4 FT), 11 rebounds and five steals. He's been on fire of late, averaging 21.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and three steals over his last five games. It's no coincidence the Spurs winning streak, that has now extended to six games, has coincided with the strong play from Leonard. He did see some help though, as Tony Parker went off for 23 points (9-20 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and nine assists in 36 minutes. After struggling through the month of February, Parker is clearly back on the right track, as he's averaging 24.5 points and 5.3 assists in four games since the start of March. Danny Green's shot was dialed in as well Wednesday. He went 5-for-6 from beyond the arc and 4-for-5 from the free throw line to score 19 points, while also adding six rebounds. He has been fantastic from the three-point line lately, shooting 50 percent or higher in five of his last six games. Marco Belinelli got hot off the bench and didn't miss a shot to score 10 points (4-4 FG, 2-2 3Pt) in just 21 minutes. The Raptors received the bulk of their production from their backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. Lowry went 10-for-19 from the field and 5-for-9 from the three-point line to score 32 points, to go along with five assists and two steals. In three games since returning from injury, Lowry has looked rejuvenated and is averaging 23.7 points and five assists over that stretch. DeRozan, on the other hand, scored 21 points (8-18 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-7 FT) of his own, while adding four assists in 39 minutes. Like Lowry, he's played extremely well of late, and is averaging 27.0 points and 4.2 assists over the first five games of March. While most of the focus was on those two, Amir Johnson quitely posted a double-double, finishing with 16 points (8-14 FG, 0-2 FT) and 14 rebounds. It was his first time reaching double-digit points in his last nine games, while the double-double was his first since the middle of January, so it was good to see the added production from the forward. Coming off the bench, Louis Williams chipped in with 11 points (5-10 FG, 1-4 3Pt) as well. The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, while the Raptors will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Toronto,Raptors,AT&T Center,38,26,40,23,9.0,16.0,39.0,82.0,22.0,28.0,45.0,24.0,11.0,8.0,26.0,43.0,97.0,13.0,18.0,46.0,19.0,9.0,Kawhi Leonard,11.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,24.0,10.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,38,Terrence Ross,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,24,Tim Duncan,13.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,Amir Johnson,14.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Tiago Splitter,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Jonas Valanciunas,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,21,Danny Green,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,25,DeMar DeRozan,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,38,Tony Parker,2.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,20.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,36,Kyle Lowry,4.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,32.0,10.0,19.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,42,Marco Belinelli,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,20,Lou Williams,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,23,Cory Joseph,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Patrick Patterson,10.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,29,Boris Diaw,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,16,Greivis Vasquez,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,14,Patty Mills,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,11,James Johnson,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Aron Baynes,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Tyler Hansbrough,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

												The Utah Jazz (27-36) extended their winning streak to three games Tuesday by grinding out a 87-82 victory over the New York Knicks (12-51) at the EnergySolutions Arena. When it was announced that Utah would be without its leading scorer, Gordon Hayward, for Tuesday's contest, Jazz coach Quin Snyder got creative with his lineup. Trey Burke and Elijah Millsap moved into the starting lineup, but had their struggles. The surprise of the game was Rodney Hood, who had a career-high 17 points off the bench as Utah overcame Hayward's absence. The Knicks were held to just 39 percent from the field as they dropped their fifth straight game. New York's fifth consecutive loss has been marked be an utter lack of scoring. During this five game stretch, the Knicks have failed to reach 90 points in each outing. The Knicks were missing Tim Hardaway Jr. for the second straight game as he continues to deal with back spasms. Alexey Shved started in Hardaway's place and put up a team-high 21 points. The Knicks will look to snap their losing streak on Thursday when they take on the Lakers. Utah was without Gordon Hayward for the first time this season, but was still able to win for the eighth time in its last ten outings. Derrick Favors picked up the slack on the offensive end with 29 points on 64.7% shooting from the field. The Jazz will get a tougher test on Friday when the Rockets come to town.  											",Utah,Jazz,New York,Knicks,Vivint Smart Home Arena,12,51,27,36,6.0,17.0,30.0,69.0,19.0,27.0,40.0,15.0,11.0,5.0,13.0,31.0,79.0,15.0,17.0,38.0,17.0,12.0,Elijah Millsap,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,14,Lance Thomas,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Derrick Favors,12.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,29.0,11.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Lou Amundson,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Rudy Gobert,14.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,37,Andrea Bargnani,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,19.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,33,Dante Exum,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,36,Alexey Shved,10.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,21.0,6.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,41,Trey Burke,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,27,Langston Galloway,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,28,Rodney Hood,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,16.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,24,Shane Larkin,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,22,Joe Ingles,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,35,Cleanthony Early,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,15,Trevor Booker,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Jason Smith,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Jeremy Evans,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Cole Aldrich,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Jerrelle Benimon,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2,Travis Wear,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11

												The Los Angeles Lakers (17-46) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23-40) 93-85 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. While they were down one after the first half, the Lakers went off in the second, out-scoring the Pistons 44-35 to finish the game and pull off the eight-point victory in front of their home crowd. While both teams struggled to just 23 percent from the three-point line, the Lakers grabbed the advantage from the field, finishing at 43 percent from the floor, while the Pistons went just 39 percent. The Lakers also held a significant advantage from the free throw line. They went 26-for-30 from the line, while the Pistons made just 13-of-19 attempts. Leading the way for the Lakers was Jordan Hill, who went 7-for-15 from the field to score 16 points, while adding three rebounds as well. It was his second start in a row at forward, but this game marked a much better result, as he posted just eight points in Sunday's start against the Mavericks. He's now averaging 12.3 points and eight rebounds on the year. Wesley Johnson also played a factor in the win and finished with 13 points (2-6 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 8-8 FT) and two steals in 33 minutes. He's picked it up offensively of late, averaging 13.5 points over his last five games, despite averaging just 9.7 points on the season. The Lakers got some needed production from their bench, with both Jeremy Lin and Ed Davis reaching double figures in points. Lin recorded 12 points (1-4 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 9-12 FT), seven rebounds and five assists, while Davis posted 13 points (6-8 FG, 1-2 FT) and six rebounds of his own. While he didn't do much offensively with just four points, Carlos Boozer was a big help on the boards and finished with 10 rebounds. Despite the loss, the Pistons saw a strong effort from their frontcourt duo of Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond. Monroe finished with a team-high of 24 points (10-14 FG, 4-8 FT), while adding nine rebounds and two blocked shots as well. He's been one of the few bright spots during the Pistons' seven-game losing streak, as he's averaged 20.3 points and 9.3 rebounds over his last three games. Drummond, on the other hand, recorded 14 points (7-11 FG) and a game-high of 21 rebounds. He's been an animal on the boards for the Pistons, recording 18 or more rebounds in three of his last four games. Also getting into the action on the offensive side of the ball was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Caldwell-Pope went 5-for-14 from the field and 4-for-10 from the three-point line to score 15 points. He hasn't been shooting the best recently and has shot less than 40 percent from the field in each of his last six games. Reggie Jackson struggled with his shot as well and finished with just two points (1-9 FG, 0-4 3Pt) in 22 minutes.  The Lakers' next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Thursday, while the Pistons will travel to Oakland to play the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.

												The Washington Wizards (36-28) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (28-34) 95-69 in Charlotte on Monday.The Wizards dominated the game from start to finish, opening up a 15-point lead in the first quarter and never looking back. Washington was lead by Marcin Gortat, who scored a game-high 20 points on 9-of-11 shooting and grabbed seven rebounds in 28 minutes. There has been no stopping Gortat recently, as he has averaged 14.4 points and 12.4 rebounds per game over his last five outings. John Wall also had a solid outing, recording 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting, nine assists, and five rebounds in 29 minutes. Bradley Beal, who sat out last game to rest, played a team-high 31 minutes Monday and scored 14 points on 7-of-16 shooting to go along with five rebounds and three assists. Kevin Seraphin scored 12 points on 6-of-9 shooting and was the only other Wizard to score in double figures.The Wizards shot an impressive 52 percent from the field and the win gives them a 2.5-game lead over Milwaukee for the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference.Mo Williams led the way for the Hornets in the losing effort, recording 19 points on 6-of-18 shooting and seven assists in 33 minutes. Al Jefferson scored 14 points on 7-of-14 shooting to go along with five assists.

												The Atlanta Hawks (50-13) defeated the Sacramento Kings (21-42) 130-105 on Monday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.In an all-around dominant effort from the Hawks, they built an early lead, gathering a 76-54 advantage by half. After surpassing the 100-point mark in the third quarter, they were able to coast to an easy 25-point victory in front of their home crowd the rest of the way. The Hawks shot extremely well in this game, going 60 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 48 percent from the floor and 40 percent from deep. The Hawks also forced the Kings into 16 turnovers, while committing just 13 of their own.The Hawks starters all did their part, with each reaching double figures in points. Al Horford led the way, scoring 20 points (9-13 FG), to go along with four rebounds and three blocked shots. He's played well of late, averaging 16.8 points over his last five games, while shooting 55 percent or higher from the field in four of those five. Kyle Korver also had his shot dialed in, going 7-for-9 from the field and 6-for-8 from the three-point line to score 20 points in 31 minutes. He'd been struggling with his shot lately, as he failed to reach double-digit points in four straight games prior to Monday. He shot 40 percent or less in all four of those games, so it was good to see him hit nearly everything on Monday. Notching a double-double, Jeff Teague posted 18 points (7-11 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-3 FT), five rebounds and 13 assists in 29 minutes. Surprisingly it was his first double-double since the end of January, but he's still been scoring at a high rate lately, averaging 19.0 points over his last four games. DeMarre Carroll added 20 points (8-16 FG, 4-9 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and five rebounds as well.  Doing his best to keep the Kings in the game was Rudy Gay. Gay went 10-for-15 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 23 points, while adding four rebounds and a blocked shot as well. During the Kings' four-game losing streak, he's been one of the few bright spots, as he's averaged 29.7 points and 6.7 rebounds per game over his last three outings. Recording somewhat of an off game, DeMarcus Cousins finished with just 12 points (3-9 FG, 6-6 FT), but still grabbed 14 rebounds and six assists. It marked his third double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 22.7 points and 14.3 rebounds per game. Ray McCallum had one of the better games of his season, as he got the start at point guard. He went 6-for-10 from the field and 1-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 15 points, while adding five assists. After shooting just 30 percent (3-10 FG) in Saturday's game against the Heat, it was good to see him get things turned around. Ben McLemore added 12 points (4-16 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and three assists as well.The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday, while the Kings will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday.

												The Boston Celtics (26-36) defeated the Miami Heat (28-35) 100-90 in Miami on Monday. Isaiah Thomas carried the Celtics down the stretch of the fourth quarter and scored a team-high 25 points on 7-of-17 shooting and went a perfect 8-for-8 from the free throw line in 31 minutes. Brandon Bass put in his second solid performance in a row, recording 14 points on 7-of-14 shooting and nine rebounds in 33 minutes. In his last two games, Bass has logged 33 points and 26 rebounds in 71 minutes. Luigi Datome (13) and Kelly Olynyk round out the Celtics players in double figures.The win brings Boston within two games of the eighth-place Charlotte Hornets in the Eastern Conference playoff hunt. Dwyane Wade led the way in Miami's losing effort, scoring a game-high 34 points on 13-of-23 shooting in 35 minutes. Michael Beasley played 32 minutes off the bench and scored 14 points on 6-of-16 shooting. Mario Chalmers (12) and Luol Deng (11) round out the Heat players in double figures. Hassan Whiteside was ejected from the game after forcefully shoving Boston's Kelly Olynyk in the back of the neck. He had seven points and nine rebounds in 22 minutes prior to his ejection. Goran Dragic (back) was held out for the second straight game. The loss drops the Heat to a half-game behind the Hornets for the final playoff spot in the East.Up next, Boston will head home Wednesday and go up against the Grizzlies, while Miami will stay home to take on the Nets on Wednesday. 											",Miami,Heat,Boston,Celtics,AmericanAirlines Arena,26,36,28,35,,,,,,,,,,6.0,25.0,39.0,87.0,16.0,17.0,43.0,17.0,9.0,Luol Deng,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,33,Jae Crowder,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,28,Henry Walker,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,25,Brandon Bass,9.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,32,Hassan Whiteside,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Tyler Zeller,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Dwyane Wade,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,34.0,13.0,23.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,35,Evan Turner,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,27,Mario Chalmers,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,33,Marcus Smart,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,27,Tyler Johnson,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,33,Isaiah Thomas,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,7.0,17.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,31,Michael Beasley,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,31,Kelly Olynyk,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,20,Chris Andersen,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Jonas Jerebko,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,23,Shabazz Napier,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Gerald Wallace,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Goran Dragic,,,,,,,,,,,,Gigi Datome,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20

												The Memphis Grizzlies (45-18) defeated the Chicago Bulls (39-26) 101-91 on Monday at the United Center in Chicago.While they were up just two points at the break, the Grizzlies used a strong second half, where they out-scored the Bulls 60-52, to steal a road win in Chicago. The Grizzlies were the superior shooters in this one, going 50 percent from the field, while the Bulls went just 44 percent. What also made a big difference was turnovers though, as the Grizzlies forced the Bulls into 17, while committing just 11 of their own.The Grizzlies' frontcourt was dominant in this matchup, out-scoring the Bulls' frontcourt 68-21. Marc Gasol led the way, scoring a game-high of 23 points (10-16 FG, 3-3 FT), to go along with four rebounds and two blocked shots. After struggling to just eight points against the Pelicans on Saturday, it was good to see one of the league's best centers get back on track. He's now averaging 18.0 points and eight rebounds on the year. Helping out Gasol was Zach Randolph, who nearly posted a double-double with 16 points (7-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and nine rebounds in 30 minutes. Like Gasol, he struggled against the Pelicans on Saturday, finishing that game with only seven points, so he was able to get things turned around as well and help Marc Gasol take down his brother Pau. Jeff Green was dialed in with his shot, going 7-for-11 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while adding seven rebounds as well. He's put in two impressive performances in a row, combining for 39 points and 13 rebounds over his last two. Not only did those three do it on offense, but they also were able to do it defensively and limit the Bulls' best player in Pau Gasol.Pau Gasol finished with just 13 points (6-14 FG, 1-1 FT) and 11 rebounds in 31 minutes. While he did record a double-double, he needed to do even more, with the likes of Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson all sitting out with injuries. While the Bulls' frontcourt didn't have much success, their backcourt is what kept them close. Starting at shooting guard, Tony Snell posted a team-high of 21 points (7-13 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 3-4 FT), while adding two steals. In just his fifteenth start of the year, he was able to post double-digit points after failing to do so in his previous three games. Over his last three games he had combined for just 12 points, including going scoreless on Sunday against the Spurs, so we'll see if that helps rebuild his confidence moving forward. Aaron Brooks also got into the action with 15 points (6-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and four assists. Coming off the bench, Nikola Mirotic double-doubled with 18 points (6-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and 12 rebounds. He's on a very strong stretch of six games, where he's averaging an impressive 20.8 points per game.The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Bulls will travel to Philadelphia to play the Sixers on Wednesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (35-29) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (33-30) 114-103 in Milwaukee on Monday. Anthony Davis was dominant once again for the Pelicans, helping the team close out the game down the final stretch. Davis scored a game-high 43 points on 17-of-23 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocks. In his four games since returning from a shoulder injury, Davis is averaging 33.5 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 4.5 blocks. Tyreke Evans had 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting and six assists in 27 minutes before suffering a left ankle injury in the fourth quarter and did not return. Eric Gordon (16) and Norris Cole (11) were the other New Orleans players to score in double figures.As a team, the Pelicans shot 58.7 percent from the field, 60 percent from three, and 81 percent from the free-throw line. There was nothing the Bucks could do defensively to stop them and the win puts New Orleans just a half-game behind the Thunder for eighth place in the Western Conference. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a career-high 29 points for Milwaukee on 11-16 shooting to go along with five rebounds, four assists, three steals, and three blocks in 37 minutes. Michael Carter-Williams also played his best game as a member of the Bucks, recording 25 points on 8-of-17 shooting and seven assists in 32 minutes. Khris Middleton scored 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting in a team-high 40 minutes. As a team, Milwaukee shot 52 percent from the field in the losing effort, and the loss leaves them in sixth place in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Pelicans will travel to Brooklyn Tuesday to take on the Nets, while the Bucks will stay home and play the Magic on Wednesday. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,New Orleans,Pelicans,Fiserv Forum,35,29,33,30,4.0,15.0,37.0,71.0,25.0,31.0,25.0,20.0,14.0,9.0,15.0,44.0,75.0,17.0,21.0,34.0,26.0,17.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,29.0,11.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,37,Quincy Pondexter,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,28,Ersan Ilyasova,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,19,Anthony Davis,10.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,43.0,17.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,40,Zaza Pachulia,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Omer Asik,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Khris Middleton,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,40,Eric Gordon,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,30,Michael Carter-Williams,1.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,25.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,32,Tyreke Evans,3.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,26,Jared Dudley,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,15,Alexis Ajinca,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,John Henson,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Dante Cunningham,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,23,Jerryd Bayless,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Norris Cole,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,23,Chris Johnson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,18,Luke Babbitt,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Tyler Ennis,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Elliot Williams,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,12

												The Denver Nuggets (23-41) defeated the New York Knicks (12-50) 106-78 on Monday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.After an even first quarter, the Nuggets got hot in the second, out-scoring the Knicks 30-15 to go into the half up by 15. They continued with that momentum in the third quarter, this time out-scoring the Knicks 36-19. With such a large lead following the third,the Nuggets were then able to coast to the easy victory in front of their home crowd in the fourth. They were the superior shooters in this one as well, finishing at 44 percent from the field, while the Knicks went just 39 percent. They also forced the Knicks into 14 turnovers, while committing just eight of their own.Kenneth Faried got the start at center in this matchup, as Jusuf Nurkic was sitting out as he nursed an ankle injury. Despite being undersized for the center position, he went off for a team-high of 19 points (7-12 FG, 5-7 FT), while also adding 11 rebounds and a blocked shot in just 27 minutes. After struggling for a good portion of the season, he's started to pick things up lately, posting four double-doubles over his last five games. During that five-game stretch, he's averaging 15.0 points and 11.6 rebounds. Wilson Chandler also played well. He went 6-for-10 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line for 17 points, to go along with six rebounds in 23 minutes. He could've had more, but he was rested with the Nuggets having such a big lead. Coming off the bench, Will Barton continued his surprising play with the Nuggets and posted 17 points (6-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT), four rebounds and three assists. Since coming over to the Nuggets from the Portland Trail Blazers 10 games ago, he's averaged 13.5 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.1 steals per game. Ty Lawson was the other Nugget in double figures, as he finished with 14 points (3-6 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 7-9 FT) and six assists.For the Knicks, Alexey Shved was in the starting lineup at shooting guard with Tim Hardaway Jr out with a back injury. Shved made the start count, finishing with a team-high of 19 points (6-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT) in just 25 minutes. It was his second strong performance in a row, as he just posted 15 points against the Pacers on Saturday. Considering he's averaged just 8.6 points so far this season, he's been a nice surprise for the Knicks since coming over from the Rockets in February. Langston Galloway was another player who had a decent showing Monday. He went 7-for-9 from the field to score 14 points, to go along with three rebounds and four assists. He continues to be very inconsistent for the Knicks, as his scoring and rebounding numbers fluctuate at a high rate from game to game. Andrea Bargnani had been turning some heads recently with two games in a row scoring more than 20 points. He came back down to earth a bit Monday and finished with just 12 points (4-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and seven rebounds. To be fair, he did play just 24 minutes due to the nature of the blowout, so he probably would have put up some some higher point totals with more time on the court.The Nuggets' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, while the Knicks will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Tuesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (50-12) defeated the Phoenix Suns (33-32) 98-80 on Monday in Phoenix.It looked as if the Warriors were going to pull away in the second quarter, but a late run by the Suns helped them tie the game going into halftime. However, Golden State was able to pull away once again after a big third quarter gave them a 15-points lead. The Warriors then pulled away for good in the final period with Stephen Curry leading the way. The MVP-candidate recorded a game-high 36 points on 14-of-24 shooting, six rebounds, five assists, and four steals. The other splash brother, Klay Thompson, added 25 points on 8-of-19 shooting. Draymond Green put together a triple-double of 11 points and 10 rebounds in 34 minutes and was the only other Golden State player to score in double figures. The win gives the Warriors their fourth straight win and extends their lead in the Western Conference over the Grizzlies to 5.5 games.  Eric Bledsoe lead the way for the Suns in the losing effort, scoring 19 points on 6-of-11 shooting in 36 minutes. Bledsoe's running-mate in the backcourt, Brandon Knight, had 13 points in 13 minutes before going down with a sprained left ankle and he did not return. The severity of the sprain is currently unknown, but it is unlikely he sees the court in Phoenix's next game.Alex Len recorded a double-double, putting up 10 points and 11 rebounds in 28 minutes, and T.J. Warren played well off the bench, logging 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting in 24 minutes.As a team, the Suns recorded just 13 assists to 18 turnovers and the loss puts them three games back from the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.Up next, the Warriors will head home Wednesday to take on the Detroit Pistons, while the Suns will stay home Wednesday and go up against the Minnesota Timberwolves. 											",Phoenix,Suns,Golden State,Warriors,Talking Stick Resort Arena,50,12,33,32,4.0,11.0,29.0,74.0,18.0,23.0,37.0,13.0,18.0,13.0,30.0,35.0,81.0,15.0,19.0,48.0,17.0,17.0,P.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (41-23) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14-48) 89-76 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.After losing two games in a row, the Clippers ran into the struggling Timberwolves at the right time, as they were able to take home the 13-point victory in front of their home crowd. Helping to do that was their shooting, as they went 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 25 percent from deep. With such a large advantage in that category for the Clippers, the Timberwolves really never stood a chance.J.J. Redick and DeAndre Jordan formed an unstoppable duo in this matchup. Jordan went 10-for-11 from the field to score 20 points, while also adding 17 rebounds and two blocked shots. This marked his thirteenth straight game with at least 10 rebounds. He had been struggling with his offense lately though, combining for just 12 points in his two previous games, so it was good to see the center put up some numbers this time around. Redick, on the other hand, went 10-for-19 from the floor and 3-for-7 from the three-point line for a team-high of 26 points. He's now shot over 40 percent in four straight games, a stretch where he's averaging 22.0 points per game. Coming off the bench, Austin Rivers added 13 points (5-8 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and six assists in just 22 minutes. He's seen extended time with Jamal Crawford out with an injury and has posted two strong performances in a row, after going off for 22 points in Sunday's game against the Warriors. Chris Paul struggled offensively with just two points (1-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt), but made up for it by notching 15 assists, as his teammates were knocking down everything they could get their hands on.Adreian Payne did everything he could to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the free throw line to finish with a team-high of 16 points, while adding 15 rebounds and a blocked shot over 37 minutes. It was his second double-double of the season in just his third career start, while he set season-highs in both points and rebounds in the loss as well. Posting a double-double of his own, Nikola Pekovic recorded 12 points (5-12 FG, 2-4 FT) and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes. It marked his first double-double over his last three games, after posting five straight previous to that. He's now averaging 12.9 points and 7.7 rebounds on the season. Andrew Wiggins and Kevin Martin were the other two Timberwolves to finish in double figures. Wiggins finished with 11 points (5-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and five rebounds, while Martin added 10 points (2-6 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and two assists.The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (38-23) defeated the Chicago Bulls (39-24) 116-105 on Sunday. The Bulls looked sloppy throughout the game, forcing passes and mishandling the basketball. Without offensive stand-outs Jimmy Butler (elbow) and Derrick Rose (knee), the Bulls were forced to rely on Aaron Brooks (22 points) and Pau Gasol (23 points). While they led the team in scoring, Brooks and Gasol also combined for six of the team's 20 turnovers.The Spurs defense created chaos all over the court, racking up 15 steals. While both teams shot around 50 percent from the field, the Spurs got off 17 more shots as a result of the Bulls' turnovers. Tony Parker had a monster day, finishing with a season-high 32 points (13-19 FG, 1-1 3Pt) in 30 minutes. Small forward Kawhi Leonard contributed 20 points (9-20 FG, 0-4 3Pt) in 27 minutes.The Bulls and Spurs finished their season series at 1-1. They last met on Jan. 22, when the Bulls won 104-81 at the United Center in Chicago. That night, Rose was the high-scorer with 22 points, and Butler second-highest with 17. Sunday's game demonstrates how much the Bulls need their stars back in the lineup if they have any hopes of a deep playoff run. Taj Gibson (ankle) also missed the game for the Bulls. The Spurs are currently the seven seed in the Western Conference, enjoying a five-game winning streak.The Spurs will host the Raptors on Tuesday, and the Bulls will return home to face the Grizzlies on Monday.

												The Warriors (49-12) held off a late run to defeat the Clippers (40-23) at ORACLE Arena in Oakland on Sunday afternoon.Golden State, which led by seven at halftime, broke the game open in the third quarter, outscoring Los Angeles 30-18 in the period. Stephen Curry spurred a 9-2 run in the middle of the quarter punctuated by a jaw-dropping play in which he weaved through four Clippers defenders before splashing in a long, pull-up three-pointer with nine seconds left on the shot clock. The basket put the Warriors up 13 points, and the lead swelled to 16 on the next possession when Draymond Green put in a running layup plus the foul.The Clippers trailed by 19 entering the fourth quarter but went on a 16-5 run late in the period, slicing the deficit to just eight with a minute to play. They’d be held scoreless the rest of the way, however, losing for the second time in a row after falling to the Trail Blazers in overtime Wednesday night.Aside from the mini-run in the third quarter, Curry was kept in check, finishing with only 12 points in 32 minutes. Green paced Golden State with 23 points and six rebounds, while Klay Thompson chipped in 21 points, including three three-pointers. Shaun Livingston added 21 points and eight rebounds off the bench in 28 minutes.The Clippers were led by 22 points from Austin Rivers, who made 8-of-14 field goal attempts. Chris Paul finished with 14 points and 11 assists, and J.J. Redick added 18 points. DeAndre Jordan contributed six points and 14 boards in 32 minutes. The Clippers were still without Blake Griffin (elbow) and Jamal Crawford (calf).

												The Charlotte Hornets (28-33) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23-39) 108-101 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.These teams continue to go in opposite directions, as the Hornets have now won five in a row, while the Pistons have brought their losing streak to six in a row. With the win, the Hornets have surprisingly pushed themselves to the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference standings, a half game above both the Pacers and Heat. The Hornets were the superior shooters in this one, going 52 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Pistons finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep.The Hornets were led by Al Jefferson, who scored a team-high of 24 points (10-14 FG, 4-6 FT), while adding eight rebounds and three assists in 30 minutes. Jefferson has been the model of consistency for this team, as he's now averaged 21.8 points and 10.8 rebounds over his last four games. Jefferson received some help from Mo Williams though, who finished with 21 points (6-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 8-8 FT) and nine assists in 37 minutes. Since coming over from the Timberwolves at the trade deadline, he's been a fantastic pick-up and is averaging 21.7 points and 8.7 rebounds over nine games with the Hornets. Gerald Henderson came close to a triple-double, as he posted 13 points (5-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT), six rebounds and nine assists. The nine assists matched a season-high for him, while he's picked up his scoring of late and is averaging 16.5 points over his last four games. Cody Zeller pitched in with 11 points (4-5 FG, 3-3 FT) and seven rebounds as well .Reggie Jackson may finally be getting comfortable with his new team, as he posted arguably his best game with the Pistons since coming over from the Thunder at the trade deadline. He went 9-for-21 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 25 points, while also adding seven rebounds and seven assists. In seven games since joining the Pistons, he's averaging 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game. Greg Monroe also did his best to keep the Pistons close, recording 18 points (7-11 FG, 4-6 FT), 11 rebounds and four assists. The double-double marked his sixth over his last seven games, as he's now averaging a double-double on the season. Playing just 23 minutes, Andre Drummond was efficient with his time and posted 16 points (7-13 FG, 2-4 FT), five rebounds and two blocked shots. He usually plays in the mid-thirties for minutes, but the Pistons gave him some rest with a lighter work load on Sunday.The Hornets' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Pistons will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday.

												The Orlando Magic (21-43) defeated the Boston Celtics (25-36) 103-98 on Sunday in Orlando. The game was tied heading into the final period, but with the Celtics up five midway through the fourth quarter, the Magic were able to rattle off a 19-6 run that put them on top for good. Orlando was once again led by Victor Oladipo, who scored a game-high 22 points on 7-of-16 shooting to go along with seven rebounds and five assists in 42 minutes. Oladipo has been playing his best basketball of the season as of late, averaging 28.3 points, 5.8 assists, and 4.0 rebounds in his last four outings. Rookie Elfrid Payton also put together a solid performance, recording 19 points on 7-of-16 shooting, 10 rebounds, and seven assists in 42 minutes. Nikola Vucevic (ankle) missed his second game in a row, but Dewayne Dedmon did an adequate job filling in as the starting center, putting up 11 points and 16 rebounds in 28 minutes. Tobias Harris (21) and Maurice Harkless (14) round out the Magic players who scored in double figures. Brandon Bass led the Celtics in their losing effort, recording 19 points on 9-of-14 shooting, 17 rebounds, and five assists in 38 minutes. Isaiah Thomas scored a team-high 21 points on 5-of-14 shooting to go along with nine assists and five rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. Marcus Smart (16), Evan Turner (10), and Luigi Datome (10) round out the Celtics in double figures. With Avery Bradley (elbow) still out, Jae Crowder was put into the starting lineup for the second straight game. Crowder struggled shooting the ball in this outing, scoring just seven points on 2-of-12 shooting and grabbing six rebounds in 32 minutes. Up next, the Magic will travel to Indiana Tuesday to take on the Pacers, while Boston, who remains 2.5 games out of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, will head to Miami to take on the Heat on Monday. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Charlotte,Hornets,Little Caesars Arena,28,33,23,39,3.0,14.0,39.0,89.0,20.0,25.0,42.0,21.0,10.0,6.0,17.0,41.0,79.0,20.0,23.0,39.0,32.0,9.0,Tayshaun Prince,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Greg Monroe,11.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,35,Cody Zeller,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Andre Drummond,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Al Jefferson,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,24.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,15.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,31,Gerald Henderson,6.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,37,Reggie Jackson,7.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,21.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,33,Mo Williams,0.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,37,Anthony Tolliver,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,Marvin Williams,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,24,Shawne Williams,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Bismack Biyombo,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Jodie Meeks,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,13.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Brian Roberts,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,14,John Lucas III,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Lance Stephenson,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,22,Caron Butler,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Jeffery Taylor,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (35-28) defeated the Toronto Raptors (38-25) 109-104 on Sunday. Russell Westbrook continued his unbelievable statistical hot streak in the Thunders' winning effort, recording 30 points on 9-of-21 shooting, 17 assists, and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. The triple-double is Westbrook's fifth in six games played and he has averaged 36.8 points 11.0 assists, and 12.0 rebounds over that stretch. Enes Kanter put together his best performance since joining the Thunder at the trade deadline, putting up 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting and 12 rebounds. Serge Ibaka also scored 21 points on 10-of-16 shooting to go along with seven rebounds and five blocks. As a team, Oklahoma City committed 18 turnovers to Toronto's eight, but were also able to score 17 points off turnovers, while the Raptors were only able to score nine.It was Toronto's wings that lead the way in the losing effort, with DeMar DeRozan scoring a team-high 24 points on 11-of-22 shooting and dishing out nine assists, while Terrence Ross added 20 points on 7-of-12 shooting. This was the first time Ross scored over 20 points in a game since the beginning of February. In his second game back since being returning from being inactive, Kyle Lowry struggled shooting from the field, going 5-of-15 en route to 14 points and five assists. Lou Williams (11), Greivis Vasquez(10), and Jonas Valanciunas (10) round out the Raptors who scored in double figures. Up next, the Thunder, who are holding onto a one-game lead for the eighth seed in the West, will stay at home to go up against the Clippers on Wednesday. Toronto, who are the fourth seed in the East, will travel to San Antonio Tuesday to take on the Spurs.

												The Dallas Mavericks (41-24) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (16-46) 100-93 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Coming out of the third quarter, the Lakers surprisingly held a 77-75 lead. The Mavericks picked it up in the fourth quarter though, out-scoring the Lakers 25-16 to end the game and seal the seven-point victory on the road in Los Angeles. The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this one, going 49 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers finished at 46 percent from the field and just 14 percent from deep. The Lakers also turned the ball over 16 times, while forcing the Mavericks into just eight.Monta Ellis did the bulk of the work offensively for the Mavericks. He went 12-for-22 from the field and 5-for-7 from the three-point line to score 31 points, while adding three assists in 38 minutes. He had a brutal showing against the Golden State Warriors on Friday, where he shot just 14 percent (2-for-14 FG, 0-4 3Pt) from the field, so it was good to see him get back on track Sunday. Dirk Nowitzki finished with 12 points (5-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and four rebounds in 26 minutes. He hasn't been scoring much lately, as he's averaging just 12.5 points over his last four games, which is far less than his season average of 17.4 points per game. Also scoring less than his season scoring average was Chandler Parsons, who recorded just 11 points (5-11 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and six rebounds. Like Nowitzki, he's been playing poorly offensively of late and is averaging just 10.0 points over his last four games. Despite their performances though, they were still able to come out with the win and end their two-game losing streak.Rookie Jordan Clarkson had a solid game in the losing effort, finishing with 15 points (6-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT), six rebounds and five assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's coming off a 25-point, six-assist performance Friday. Over those two games, he's shot a combined 18-for-31 from the field, as he looks to be dialed in and more confident than he's been all season long. Also doing his best to help the Lakers stay in the game was Carlos Boozer, who came off the bench for a team-high of 17 points (8-15 FG, 1-1 FT), to go along with eight rebounds in 25 minutes. Over his last four games, he's averaging 13.0 points and 7.5 rebounds as he continues to be the veteran leader of this team.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (34-29) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (44-18) 95-89 on Saturday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.Coming into this game sitting just one game back from the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings, the Pelicans pulled off a big win Saturday, bringing themselves to within a half game of the Thunder. Despite being down 50-38 at half, the Pelicans took off in the third quarter, out-scoring the Grizzlies 33-17 to help set themselves up for the six-point victory in front of their home crowd. The Pelicans were the superior shooters in this game, going 48 percent from the field, while the Grizzlies finished at just 43 percent.The Pelicans were led by the duo of Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evans in this one. Evans went 10-for-16 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to finish with a team-high of 26 points, to go along with seven rebounds and three steals. He struggled to just 11 points on Friday against the Boston Celtics, so it was good to see him rebound with a big performance. Davis, on the other hand, finished with 23 points (11-21 FG, 1-1 FT), 10 rebounds and five blocked shots in 40 minutes. After missing five games in a row with a shoulder injury, the Pelicans are loving what they're seeing from their superstar, as he's averaged 30.3 points, 12.3 rebounds and 5.3 blocks in the three games since his return. He's pushed his season averages to 24.3 points and 10.4 rebounds on the year.  Eric Gordon also played a factor in the win, as he posted 16 points (4-6 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and six assists in 35 minutes. He's played well of late as well, combining for 36 points and eight assists over his last two games.For the Grizzlies, Jeff Green did the bulk of the work offensively. He went 8-for-18 from the field, but 0-for-3 from the three-point line to record 20 points, while adding four rebounds and three assists as well. He had shot less than 30 percent in two out of his last three games coming into Saturday, so it was good to see him get things turned around and have a productive showing from the field in this matchup. Mike Conley also had a strong showing, finishing with 17 points (5-9 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT), four rebounds and three assists of his own over 30 minutes. He's been quite inconsistent with his scoring lately, but he was able to put up some decent numbers Saturday. With both Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol combining for just 15 points between the two, Beno Udrih was the only other Grizzlies' player in double figures for points. In just 15 minutes off the bench, he posted 11 points (4-6 FG, 3-3 FT) and four rebounds. With a few of their stars struggling in this one, the Grizzlies just weren't able to overcome the Pelicans' strong play.The Pelicans' next game will be on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, while the Grizzlies will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (40-25) improved to 21-5 over the past 26 games with their win over the Phoenix Suns (33-31), 89-79. Alex Len was held out after spraining his right ankle the previous night. Earl Barron earned a start in Len’s absence. The Suns outscored the Cavaliers 27-9 in the final period to make the game seem closer than the final score.Tristan Thompson was the unsung hero for the Cavaliers, producing 15 points, a team-high 12 rebounds, one assist, and one steal in 29 minutes off the bench. Kyrie Irving and J.R. Smith combined to shoot 6-of-23 from the field. Irving picked up two fouls early in the first quarter and didn’t return until the third quarter.P.J.Tucker joined the starting lineup after a one-game demotion for missing the team bus to shootaround, shifting Marcus Morris back to a reserve role. T.J. Warren was the only Suns player to convert more than half his shots. The starting lineup shot a combined 16-of-52, and Markieff Morris scored a team-high 16 points. Brandan Wright played a season-high 30 minutes and provided seven points, seven rebounds, one assist, two steals and three blocks. The Cavaliers have two days off before beginning a four-game road trip against the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Miami Heat (28-34) defeated the Sacramento Kings (21-40) 114-109 on Saturday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.Down 78-68 coming out of the third quarter, the Heat started playing with some urgency and out-scored the Kings 28-18 to pull it even and force an overtime battle. The overtime period went back and forth all of the way, but with the Heat up just one, Tyler Johnson hit a clutch three-pointer with just 50 seconds left in overtime, putting the Heat up by four, and the Kings were never able to make up the deficit from there on out. A big help in the Heat's comeback was their defense, as they forced the Kings into 22 turnovers, while committing just 14 of their own.The Heat's chances of winning looked bleak after finding out they'd be without three starters, including Luol Deng, Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside. The duo of Dwyane Wade and Tyler Johnson came out and made up or the key losses though, as each notched a big game. Wade went 10-for-18 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 28 points, while adding four rebounds and four assists. He's on a very strong stretch of four games, averaging 22.8 points, 5.8 assists and 2.8 steals over that span. Johnson, on the other hand, finished with 24 points (7-12 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 7-10 FT), six rebounds and six assists of his own. The rookie is starting to make his presence known, as this was the second time he surpassed the 20-point mark over his last four games. He's still averaging just 7.3 points per game on the year. Recently acquired, Michael Beasley, also was a big factor in the victory. In 37 minutes off the bench, he recorded 18 points (9-17 FG, 0-2 FT) and seven rebounds before fouling out. In just his sixth game of the year, the points were a new season-high.Despite the loss, the Kings' starters were still quite effective, especially DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay. Gay went 12-for-24 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score 27 points, to go along with eight rebounds and five assists. While the Kings continue to lose, he's been a force lately for this team, averaging 25.0 points over his last five games. Cousins, on the other hand, finished with 27 points (10-17 FG, 7-8 FT) of his own, while adding 17 rebounds before fouling out. It marked his second double-double in a row, as he's combined for 56 points and 29 rebounds over his last two games. He's now averaging 23.6 points and 12.1 rebounds on the season. Ben McLemore had a fantastic showing with his shot. He went 7-for-16 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score 20 points in 44 minutes. He had gone a combined 3-for-13 from the field over his last two games, so it was good to see him get dialed in on Saturday.The Heat's next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Monday, while the Kings will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Monday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (14-49) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (49-13) 92-84 on Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.The Atlanta Hawks came into this game on a six-game win streak, while the Sixers had lost four in a row, so it was an extremely surprising result when the Sixers came out with the victory on Saturday. Despite the loss, the Hawks were the superior shooters, going 39 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers went 37 percent from the floor and just 35 percent from deep. The Sixers did the majority of their work in the second half though, where they out-scored the Hawks 45-31, helping push them to the eight-point victory in front of their home crowd.The Sixers were led by a strong bench performance from Hollis Thompson. In 30 minutes, he went 7-for-10 from the field and 5-for-7 from the three-point line to match a team-high of 19 points, to go along with nine rebounds and four assists as well. Averaging just 7.8 points per game on the season, it was a nice suprise for the Sixers, especially considering he hadn't reached double figures in points for six straight games. Thompson received some help though, as Luc Mbah A Moute posted 19 points (8-16 FG, 3-7 3Pt) of his own, while adding three rebounds and a steal. He's turned his game up a notch lately, averaging 17.0 points and 6.3 rebounds over his last three games. Nerlens Noel was a big factor in the win as well, as he finished with 11 points (4-12 FG, 3-6 FT), 17 rebounds and five steals. The rebounds were a season-high for him, while he's also been extremely effective on the defensive side of the ball and has posted four or more steals in each of his last three games. Starting at point guard, Isaiah Canaan added 12 points (2-13 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 6-8 FT), five rebounds and eight assists.In the Hawks defense, they did decide to rest three of their starters, including DeMarre Carroll, Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver, as they have already locked up a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. With those guys out, Jeff Teague put it on himself to do the bulk of the work offensively. In 32 minutes, he finished with a team-high of 17 points (5-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT), while also recording four assists and two steals. He's had a good start to March, averaging 19.3 points and 4.3 assists over his last three games, but it wasn't enough with the majority of his supporting cast on the sideline. The Hawks also received a solid contribution off their bench though, with Dennis Schroder posting 16 points (6-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and six assists. He came in with a season average of 8.9 points per game on the year, but he's shown a lot of improvement lately and has averaged 15.8 points and eight assists over his last four games. Both Al Horford and Mike Scott reached double figures as well, adding 12 and 11 points respectively.The Sixers' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, while the Hawks will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (33-29) defeated the Washington Wizards (35-28) 91-85 on Saturday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.With the game tied late in the fourth quarter, Khris Middleton came up clutch for the Bucks, and hit a three-pointer with just over 40 seconds left in the game to put them up three. After making a stop on the defensive side of the ball, they went on to hit their free throws, and sealed the six-point victory in front of their home crowd. This game marked a big win for the Bucks, who had lost four games in a row. They've now pulled within a game and a half of the Wizards for the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference standings. Helping secure the win, the Bucks shot 46 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Wizards finished at 38 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep.Including the huge three-pointer in the closing minute of the game, Middleton went 11-for-20 from the field and 6-for-9 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 30 points, while adding nine rebounds and two steals as well. It was his first 30-point showing of the season, as it marked a new season-high for the guard. He's averaging 21.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists over his last three games. Michael Carter-Williams also played a factor in the win, as he finished with 12 points (6-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and nine assists in 27 minutes. Often criticized for his shooting, it was good to see him shoot over 50 percent from the field for the fourth time over his last six games. Jerryd Bayless gave a solid contribution from the bench, recording 13 points (4-8 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT), four rebounds and four assists in 21 minutes. The only other Buck reaching double figures in points was Ersan Ilyasova, who posted 10 points (4-7 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and five rebounds in 23 minutes as a starter.With Bradley Beal receiving the night off for rest, the Wizards seemed to struggle offensively. Paul Pierce led the team in scoring, finishing with 14 points (4-15 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 3-4 FT), to go along with eight rebounds in 24 minutes. He's now averaging 15.8 points and 4.4 rebounds over his last five games. John Wall struggled with his shot and recorded just 11 points (3-14 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-5 FT), but he did add nine rebounds, six assists and two steals, as he provided a little bit of everything else. It marked his second consecutive poor shooting performance, considering he's combined to go just 5-for-21 from the field and 2-for-9 from the three-point line over his last two games. He's still averaging 17.0 points and 10.1 assists on the season, so expect him to return to form in the next few games. The only other starter in double figures was Marcin Gortat, who posted 10 points (5-7 FG) and nine rebounds. Coming off the bench, Garrett Temple added 11 points (4-6 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT), while Ramon Sessions chipped in with 10 points (4-7 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-1 FT) of his own.The Bucks' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday, while the Wizards will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Monday.

He finished with 23 points and seven assists on Friday. The Hornets have won four straight to begin the month after winning just three games in all of February.      The Raptors made some changes to their starting lineup for Friday's tilt with Charlotte.

Lowry finished with 25 points, five assist and five rebounds in 38 minutes, while Vasquez had two points in 14 minutes. Terrence Ross was also put in the starting lineup, he led Toronto with seven assists on the evening.

												The Indiana Pacers (27-34) defeated the Chicago Bulls (39-24) 98-84 on Friday. The two teams went into the final period all tied up, but a big fourth quarter for the Pacers where Indiana outscored the Bulls 32-18 helped them prevail. Indiana was lead by Soloman Hill, who had a team-high 16 points on 5-of-10 shooting, five rebounds, and three steals in 26 minutes. Both David West and Ian Mahinmi recorded double-doubles, with West recording 10 points on 5-of-8 shooting and 10 rebounds in 24 minutes, while Mahinmi put up 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench.Rodney Stuckey also continued to make strong contributions off the bench, recording 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting, seven rebounds, and five assists in a team-high 32 minutes. C.J. Watson (11) and C.J. Miles (10) round out the Pacers scoring in double figures.The win puts Indiana in a tie with Miami for the eight-seed in the Eastern Conference, with the tiebreaker currently giving the edge to the Pacers. They will travel to Madison Square Garden Saturday to take on the struggling New York Knicks. Paul Gasol recorded his seventh consecutive double-double in the Bulls' losing effort, putting up 18 points on 7-of-17 shooting and 10 rebounds in 34 minutes. Gasol's partner in the frontcourt Joakim Noah recorded a game-high 11 assists, but only managed four points and seven rebounds. Aaron Brooks, who continues to start for Derrick Rose (knee), struggled mightily, recording just four points on 2-of-11 shooting. Tony Snell, who is starting for Jimmy Butler (elbow) also struggled, scoring eight points on 2-of-5 shooting. Rookie Doug McDermott took full advantage of his playing time on Friday, scoring 16 points in 16 minutes on 8-of-17 shooting.The loss puts Chicago in a tie for the two-seed in the Eastern Conference, but they have just a half-game lead over Toronto in the four-spot. Chicago will next travel to San Antonio Sunday to take on the Spurs. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Chicago,Bulls,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,39,24,27,34,6.0,20.0,34.0,80.0,24.0,33.0,51.0,23.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,Solomon Hill,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,16.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,26,Mike Dunleavy,9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,31,David West,10.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Pau Gasol,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,34,Roy Hibbert,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Joakim Noah,7.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,CJ Miles,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,26,Tony Snell,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,25,George Hill,3.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,24,Aaron Brooks,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,24,Rodney Stuckey,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,31,Nikola Mirotic,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,13.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,30,Ian Mahinmi,11.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Kirk Hinrich,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Luis Scola,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,E'Twaun Moore,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,C.J.

												The Orlando Magic (20-43) beat the Sacramento Kings (21-39) 119-114 on Friday.Victor Oladipo has been playing great as of late, averaging 24.6 points, 5.6 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.8 steals in 40 minutes a game over his last five. He led his team to victory against the Kings with 32 points, 10 assists, five steals, and three rebounds. Oladipo and backcourt mate Elfird Payton each had a double-double with Payton scoring 10 points to go with a team-high 12 assists. With Nikola Vucevic out due to a sore ankle, Channing Frye was reinserted into the starting lineup. Frye put up a big game with 10 rebounds, three blocks, three assists, one steal and 22 points on 6-of-9 shooting from beyond the arc. In addition to Vucevic, the Magic were also without Evan Fournier (hip), Luke Ridnour (hamstring) and Willie Green (Achilles), but managed to survive at home against Sacramento.As usual it was Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins doing work for the Kings. Gay led Sacramento with 39 points and three steals, while Cousins led them with 12 rebounds and three blocked shots. Their 68 points combined wasn't enough to get the win in Orlando and the Kings are now just 8-20 on the road this season.Sacramento will make the short trip to Miami to take on the Heat on Saturday. Orlando will host the Boston Celtics on Sunday.   											",Orlando,Magic,Sacramento,Kings,Amway Center,21,39,20,43,,,,,,,,,,10.0,27.0,38.0,85.0,28.0,38.0,43.0,18.0,14.0,Tobias Harris,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,19.0,6.0,15.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,36,Rudy Gay,8.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,39.0,16.0,26.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,41,Channing Frye,10.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,22.0,7.0,11.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,35,Jason Thompson,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Dewayne Dedmon,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,DeMarcus Cousins,12.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,29.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,38,Victor Oladipo,3.0,10.0,5.0,0.0,32.0,14.0,24.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,40,Ben McLemore,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,20,Elfrid Payton,4.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,42,Ray McCallum,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,32,Kyle O'Quinn,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Omri Casspi,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,26,Andrew Nicholson,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,24,Reggie Evans,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Ben Gordon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13,Andre Miller,5.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,23,Aaron Gordon,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,13,Derrick Williams,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,13,Willie Green,,,,,,,,,,,,Nik Stauskas,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,14

												The Utah Jazz (25-36) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (13-49) 89-83 on Friday. The 76ers held a six-point lead early in the second half, but the Jazz slowly worked their way back and ultimately took the lead for good with Gordon Hayward leading the way. Hayward scored a game-high 25 points on 7-of-16 shooting and also recorded nine rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. The Jazz's starting frontcourt was also strong in the winning effort. Derrick Favors recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds, his first double-double in four games, while Rudy Gobert fell one point shy of a double-double, putting up nine points and a game-high 15 rebounds. Trey Burke was the only other member of Utah to score in double figures, putting up 10 points on 3-of-12 shooting in 30 minutes off the bench. The Jazz have now won eight of their last 11 games and will travel to Brooklyn Sunday to take on the Nets. Isaiah Canaan led the 76ers in scoring for the second game in a row, recording 16 points on 6-of-15 shooting to go along with four assists in 28 minutes. Nerlens Noel had a double-double, putting up 10 points on 5-of-12 shooting and 11 rebounds in 37 minutes. He also had six steals. Thomas Robinson also recorded a double-double, recording 11 points and a team-high 12 rebounds in just 15 minutes of play. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute (14) and Ish Smith (14) round out the 76ers players in double figures. Robert Covington (elbow) returned from a two-game absence, but struggled coming off the bench, recording just 5 points on 1-of-8 shooting and six rebounds in 18 minutes. Jason Richardson also struggled, following up 29-point performance Wednesday with zero points on 0-of-10 shooting Friday. The 76ers have lost nine of their last 10 games and hold the NBA's second-worst record at 13-49. They will take on the East-leading Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. 											",Philadelphia,76ers,Utah,Jazz,Wells Fargo Center,25,36,13,49,9.0,31.0,31.0,86.0,9.0,18.0,41.0,21.0,12.0,6.0,12.0,27.0,71.0,29.0,41.0,49.0,17.0,18.0,JaKarr Sampson,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,22,Gordon Hayward,9.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,7.0,16.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,37,Luc Mbah a Moute,2.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,29,Derrick Favors,10.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,32,Nerlens Noel,11.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,37,Rudy Gobert,15.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,35,Jason Richardson,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,26,Joe Ingles,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,17,Isaiah Canaan,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,15.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,28,Dante Exum,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22,Robert Covington,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,18,Elijah Millsap,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,16,Jerami Grant,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,17,Trey Burke,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,30,Furkan Aldemir,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Rodney Hood,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,21,Ish Smith,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,22,Trevor Booker,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Thomas Robinson,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Jeremy Evans,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4

												The Washington Wizards (34-27) beat an injury-depleted Miami Heat (27-33) lineup 99-97 on Friday.Marcin Gortat led the way for the Wizards with a double-double of 14 points and 17 rebounds, tying the season-high 17 rebounds mark he set last Saturday against the Pistons. Washington lost their first five games coming out of the All-Star break but have turned things around with wins in two of their last three games. They got a leg up on the Heat by scoring 20 easy points off of 17 Miami turnovers, while the Heat scored just 10 points off of 15 Washington turnovers.Miami had to use a patchwork lineup to get through Friday's matchup, as the team seemed more focused on the second game of their back-to-back set Saturday when they'll return home to host a Sacramento Kings team that will afford them a good chance to secure a win. Tyler Johnson, who was signed out of the D-League on Jan. 11, started at shooting guard in place of Dwyane Wade. Wade sat out the game with a sore right hip. They also had Luol Deng sitting out the game with a right thigh contusion, which led to Henry Walker starting at small forward. To triple-down on injuries for the evening, starting point guard Goran Dragic was forced to leave the game in the third quarter with a lower back contusion and could not return. It is unclear what any of their statuses will be for Saturday's game. In the nine games they've played since the end of the All-Star break, the Heat have won five games.After losing the first game of their season series on Opening Night, the Wizards took down the Heat in each of their final three matchups this season to win the season series 3-1. With the loss, Miami fell into a tie for eighth place in the Eastern Conference playoff standings, and with several teams hovering around the final playoff spot in the East, every game will be big for the Heat the rest of the way.The Wizards will begin a two-game road trip in Milwaukee on Saturday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (49-12) asserted their dominance as the top team in the East on Friday by beating the fourth-place Cleveland Cavaliers (39-25) 106-97 on Friday.As usual, it was a team effort that gave the Hawks the win, with seven players finishing in double digits, including Dennis Schroder's 15 points and eight assists in 24 minutes off the bench. Despite playing a somewhat limited role off the bench, Schroder has averaged 15.7 points and 8.7 assists in just 29 minutes per game over his last three outings.The Hawks don't have an MVP candidate on their roster, but if they keep beating the other top teams in the NBA, it makes the idea of extending the Player of the Month Award that was given to the entire starting five for their perfect 17-0 run in January an intriguing notion to suggest for the MVP award that is historically only given to one player. They have an 11-game lead on the second-place Chicago Bulls, and they're the only team in the NBA to already have a playoff spot secured.The Cavaliers are no slouches, but they've struggled a little lately, winning just two of their last five games. They had trouble protecting the ball Friday, as Kyrie Irving coughed up the ball five times, and LeBron James tied his career high for turnovers in regulation by losing the ball nine times. The Hawks forced a lot of those turnovers with great pressure defense to force the ball out of the Cavs' playmakers' hands, and they scored 20 easy points off the Cavs' 18 turnovers. While King James struggled, James Harden was busy putting up a triple-double on the Detroit Pistons on Friday, as both players remain two of the top players in consideration for the MVP award this season, and the narratives about who is more deserving change from night to night as they trade off impressive performances.Cleveland will return home to host the Suns on Saturday, and the Hawks go on the road to face the 76ers on Saturday.

												The Boston Celtics (25-35) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (33-29) 104-98 on Friday.Isaiah Thomas relished his bench role with the Phoenix Suns, and he continues to embrace it as member of the Boston Celtics. Thomas dropped 27 points in 29 minutes against the Pelicans in New Orleans. He helped his team to a 3-2 record over their last five games, averaging 21.4 points and 4.8 assists in that time. Jae Crowder was placed into the starting lineup due to the injury to Avery Bradley's elbow. Crowder finished with 11 points, nine rebounds and four steals in 37 minutes, and gave his team immense energy without committing a foul. The Celtics are still just a few games out of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.Anthony Davis does it all for his team, and that trend continued Friday with him recording 29 points, 14 points, two assists and one steal in 42 minutes. He also added to his all-time franchise record with three blocked shots. Eric Gordon did his best to help out Davis but his 20 points weren't enough to defend their home court against the Celtics. New Orlean's point guards Tyreke Evans and Norris Cole combined for 12 turnovers, which proved to be very costly in the end. The Pelicans are the first team on the outside looking in at the Western Conference playoff picture.New Orleans will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday and the Celtics will take on the Orlando Magic on Sunday.

												The Phoenix Suns (33-30) beat the Brooklyn Nets (25-35) 108-100 in overtime on Friday.The Suns came back from a 15-point deficit to defeat the Nets in overtime. Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe combined for 31 points, 15 rebounds, 13 assists and two steals. Bledsoe committed seven turnovers, yet still managed a game-high +27 in the plus/minus statistic. P.J. Tucker was forced to come off the bench as punishment for missing the bus to Friday's shootaround. Tucker still played 37 minutes and finished with 11 points, six rebounds and two steals. Marcus Morris was the man to replace Tucker in the starting lineup. He and his twin brother Marieff Morris each had 19 points in 41 minutes for Phoenix.  All five Brooklyn players that came off the bench scored in double figures on Friday, however Joe Johnson was the lone starter to accomplish that feat. Point guard Deron Williams had a rough night going 2-for-16 from the field  for nine points, four turnovers and five fouls. Brook Lopez led the Nets with 19 points, 13 rebounds and one block, but it wasn't enough to stop the ferocious Phoenix come back.Phoenix will hed to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Saturday, as Brooklyn will host the Utah Jazz on Sunday. 											",Houston,Rockets,Detroit,Pistons,Toyota Center,23,38,42,20,6.0,28.0,37.0,90.0,21.0,25.0,55.0,23.0,19.0,4.0,27.0,35.0,100.0,13.0,17.0,48.0,20.0,12.0,Trevor Ariza,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,27,Tayshaun Prince,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21,Terrence Jones,8.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,17.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,32,Greg Monroe,8.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Donatas Motiejunas,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18,Andre Drummond,21.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,James Harden,12.0,12.0,1.0,0.0,38.0,10.0,21.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,37,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,32,Patrick Beverley,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,30,Reggie Jackson,3.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,34,Joey Dorsey,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Anthony Tolliver,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,18,Josh Smith,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,23,Caron Butler,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,17,Corey Brewer,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25,Spencer Dinwiddie,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13,Jason Terry,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,16,Jodie Meeks,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,18,Pablo Prigioni,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,5,Shawne Williams,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,15

												The Houston Rockets (41-20) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23-37) 103-93 on Friday. James Harden put the Rockets on his back, recording a triple-double in his second game back from his one-game suspension. The MVP-candidate put up 38 points on 10-of-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists, leading his team in each category. Harden also shot 16-of-18 from the free throw line.Terrence Jones (back) played his usual amount of minutes despite being listed as questionable coming into Friday's game. Jones continued his solid play in Dwight Howard's (back) absence, recording 17 points on 7-of-14 shooting and eight rebounds in 32 minutes. Corey Brewer was the only other Houston player to score in double figures, scoring 15 points on 7-of-12 shooting in 26 minutes off the bench.The Rockets now find themselves as the four-seed in the Western Conference and are just 2.5 games behind the Grizzlies for the two-seed. They will next travel to Denver on Saturday to take on the Nuggets. Greg Monroe lead the way in Detroit's losing effort, recording 19 points on 7-of-13 shooting and eight rebounds in 30 minutes.Andre Drummond struggled from the field, managing just eight points on 4-of-16 shooting, but managed to grab a game-high 21 rebounds with 12 of them coming on the offensive glass. Reggie Jackson was the only other Pistons player to score in double figures, recording 17 points on 7-of-16 shooting and seven assists.  The Pistons, now losers of five straight games, are falling fast. They are four games out of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and will head back home on Sunday to go up against the Charlotte Hornets. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Los Angeles,Lakers,FedExForum,16,45,44,17,1.0,11.0,34.0,77.0,28.0,33.0,42.0,18.0,8.0,5.0,12.0,39.0,84.0,7.0,9.0,44.0,22.0,9.0,Jeff Green,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,32,Ryan Kelly,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,17,Zach Randolph,13.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,37,Carlos Boozer,9.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Marc Gasol,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,Robert Sacre,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Courtney Lee,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,26,Wayne Ellington,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,33,Mike Conley,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,33,Jordan Clarkson,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,12.0,18.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,36,Tony Allen,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Jeremy Lin,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,26,Beno Udrih,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Ed Davis,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Kosta Koufos,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Wesley Johnson,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,29,Vince Carter,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,6,Jordan Hill,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Nick Calathes,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Tarik Black,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9

Zach Randolph led the way with a team-high 24 points and 13 rebounds in 37 minutes to help the Grizzlies put a bowtie on their season series with the Lakers, having won all four matchups.Rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson scored a career-high 25 points, but after he made a two-point field goal to put the Lakers up 75-67 with 11 minutes left in the game, Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger put Tony Allen on the rookie, and the Grizzlies roared back, with Clarkson bottled up so bad that he only got off two more shots the rest of the way and missed both of them. Still trailing 87-86 with 1:50 left in the game, Jeff Green stole the ball on a bad pass from Jordan Hill, and Green ended up being fouled, which sent him to the line to knock down both of his free throws and give the Grizzlies the lead they would never relinquish.Memphis will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Saturday, and the Lakers will return home to host the Mavericks on Sunday, when they will try to stop their four-game skid.

												The San Antonio Spurs (38-23) defeated the Denver Nuggets (22-39) 120-111 on Friday.The Spurs were led by the play of Kawhi Leonard, who played his best game since returning from his hand injury. The 23-year-old had 25 points on 10-of-17 shooting, eight rebounds, four assists, and three blocks in 36 minutes. It was Leonard's third straight game scoring 20-plus points and third straight game shooting over 50 percent from the field. Tony Parker also put in one of his best efforts on the year, scoring 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting to go along with seven assists in 36 minutes. This was the first time in eight games that Parker had at least 20 points and seven assists. All five San Antonio starters scored in double figures, with Tim Duncan (15), Danny Green (11), and Tiago Splitter (10) rounding out the five. As a team, the Spurs had 24 assists to just nine turnovers on the night.San Antonio is currently in seventh place in the West, but just 3.5 games behind the third-place Portland Trailblazers. They next will take on the Chicago Bulls at home on Sunday. This was the the Nuggets' third game after firing head coach Brian Shaw and were lead by Ty Lawson, who recorded 23 points on 7-of-13 shooting and nine assists in 33 minutes. Kenneth Faried also put together a solid performance, putting up 20 points on 9-of-15 shooting in 34 minutes. Six Denver players scored in double figures in the losing effort, with Wilson Chandler scoring 16, Danilo Gallinari and J.J. Hickson each scoring 14, and Jameer Nelson scoring 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting in just 17 minutes off the bench. After losing 12 of 13, the Nuggets have won two of three since firing Shaw. Up next, they will head home Saturday to take on the Houston Rockets.  											",San Antonio,Spurs,Denver,Nuggets,AT&T Center,22,40,38,23,9.0,24.0,42.0,78.0,24.0,31.0,35.0,24.0,8.0,6.0,17.0,45.0,86.0,15.0,23.0,38.0,21.0,13.0,Kawhi Leonard,8.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,25.0,10.0,17.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,36,Wilson Chandler,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,30,Tim Duncan,3.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Danilo Gallinari,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,31,Tiago Splitter,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Kenneth Faried,10.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Danny Green,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,29,Randy Foye,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,19,Tony Parker,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,Ty Lawson,1.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,32,Boris Diaw,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,JJ Hickson,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Manu Ginobili,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,18,Jameer Nelson,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,17,Aron Baynes,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Will Barton,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,28,Marco Belinelli,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,15,Darrell Arthur,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Patty Mills,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,7,Gary Harris,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

												The Golden State Warriors (48-12) dominated the Dallas Mavericks (40-24) en route to a 104-89 victory Friday in Oakland. It was an all-around brilliant team performance from the Warriors as six different players scored in double figures. Stephen Curry lead the way, recording 22 points on 6-of-11 shooting and seven assists in 31 minutes.Draymond Green also put together a solid outing, putting up 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting, nine rebounds, and four assists in 31 minutes. Klay Thompson struggled shooting from the field, but still managed 16 points on 5-of-14 shooting in 31 minutes. Harrison Barnes (12), Marreese Speights (12), and Shaun Livingston (10) rounded out the Golden State players who scored in double figures. The team improved to 26-2 at home this season and continue to have a hold on first place in the Western Conference. Nobody on the Mavericks could get anything going offensively. Rajon Rondo and Dirk Nowitzki led the team in scoring with 14 points each, but the two shot a combined 11-of-31 from the field. Monta Ellis had a horrendous shooting night, scoring just six points on 2-of-14 shooting. As a team, Dallas shot just 36.8 percent from the field and are currently in sixth place in the Western Conference after losing four of their last five games.Up next, the Warriors will stay at home and go up against the Clippers on Sunday, while the Mavericks will travel to Los Angeles Sunday to take on the Lakers. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Dallas,Mavericks,Chase Center,40,24,48,12,11.0,22.0,38.0,79.0,17.0,19.0,50.0,27.0,22.0,6.0,18.0,31.0,83.0,19.0,26.0,30.0,16.0,10.0,Harrison Barnes,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,28,Richard Jefferson,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,27,Draymond Green,9.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,30,Dirk Nowitzki,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,16.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,26,Andrew Bogut,13.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Tyson Chandler,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Klay Thompson,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,5.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,30,Monta Ellis,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,31,Stephen Curry,2.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,22.0,6.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,30,Rajon Rondo,4.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,31,Andre Iguodala,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Charlie Villanueva,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,14,Marreese Speights,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Amar'e Stoudemire,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,J.J.

												The Chicago Bulls (39-23) overcame a 10-point fourth quarter deficit to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder (34-28) 108-105 on Thursday at the United Center. This game attained instant-classic status with some late game heroics from unlikely characters. While Russell Westbrook continued his dominance with 43 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists, it was Chicago's E'Twaun Moore and Nikola Mirotic who stole the show late. Mirotic had 26 points and eight boards in 34 minutes off the bench. Moore went 9-for-10 in the game and put up 13 points in the fourth quarter. With time winding down, Pau Gasol kicked it out to Moore, who canned the go-ahead three pointer. Oklahoma City couldn't close out Chicago as it allowed a sizeable fourth-quarter lead slip away. Russell Westbrook's triple-double streak ended at four games, and it was fitting that it came to an end in Chicago, where Michael Jordan strung together seven consecutive triple-doubles back in 1989. Still, Westbrook kept his streak of 40-point games alive with his third straight 40-point outing. The Thunder will return to action Sunday when they host the Raptors. Chicago has been devastated by injuries lately, but it pulled together a complete effort to score a huge win in front of the home crowd. In addition to Mirotic and Moore's strong outings, Pau Gasol notched another double-double with 21 points and 12 rebounds. The Bulls have a quick turnaround as they will travel to Indiana on Friday to face the Pacers.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (41-19) won their fifth straight game Thursday, defeating the Dallas Mavericks (40-23) 94-75 at the Moda Center. Dallas cut Portland's lead to 10 with just over four minutes to go in the fourth but did not register another point as the Trail Blazers pulled away en route to an easy victory. However, the bigger story for Portland on Thursday night was Wesley Matthews, who went down with a left foot injury. Matthews reportedly went in for an MRI shortly after exiting the game in the third. If Matthews' injury turns out to be serious, Portland will be missing its best three point shooter. Dallas came into the game on two days rest, but had a rough night from the floor. The Mavericks were held to 37 percent from the field and went just 2-for-16 from beyond the arc. Tyson Chandler returned from a three-game absence and finished with four points and 14 rebounds over 28 minutes. The Mavericks have another tough game on the docket as they will travel to the Oracle Arena to take on the Warriors on Friday. Portland was playing its second game in as many nights after grinding out an overtime victory in Los Angeles against the Clippers on Wednesday. Nicolas Batum turned in another big performance with 15 points and 12 rebounds in 36 minutes on the floor. The Trail Blazers will await the results of Matthews MRI, but if he is forced to miss time, Arron Afflalo will likely step into the shooting guard role. Portland will return to action Saturday in Minnesota.

												The Indiana Pacers (26-34) improved to over .500 at home this season with a 105-82 rout of the New York Knicks (12-48) on Wednesday at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Indiana opened up a 24-point halftime lead and never looked back en route to its third straight win.

												The Phoenix Suns (32-30) defeated the Orlando Magic (19-43) on Wednesday.Brandon Knight had his best game since being acquired in a deadline deal from the Milwaukee Bucks. Knight finished Wednesday's contest with 28 points on 10-of-12 from the field. He also had seven assists and three steals, one of which was with less than five seconds remaining when he was guarding the inbounder Willie Green. Knight was immediately fouled by Green, and then sank two free throws to secure the victory. Alex Len was available to play, as he was not suspended for his scuffle with Hassan Whiteside in Monday's game with the Miami Heat. Len ended with two points and four rebounds in 22 minutes against Orlando.   Victor Oladipo put on a show but it wasn't enough to overcome an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter. He scored 17 of his 38 points in the final period, helping the Magic cut the Suns' lead to one point on two separate occasions in the last minute of the game. Oladipo had four rebounds, three assists and three steals to go along with seven costly turnovers. Dewayne Dedmon started at power forward for the Magic in place of Channing Frye who was moved to a reserve role for Wednesday's game. Dedmon finished with eight points, eight rebounds and one block in 21 minutes. Frye played 15 minutes and had four points, four rebounds and a block.Orlando will host the Sacramento Kings on Friday, as the Suns will head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets.

												The Boston Celtics (24-35) held on in a nail-biter Wednesday to defeat the Utah Jazz (24-36) 85-84 at the TD Garden. The Celtics led 81-73 with just under 2:30 to play, but the Jazz battled back with contributions from Trey Burke, Gordon Hayward, and Rodney Hood to force the game to be decided on the last possession. Gordon Hayward hit the go-ahead shot with one second remaining, but Boston would have the last laugh. Tyler Zeller converted a buzzer-beater under the hoop to give Boston the win. Utah is now 5-2 since the All-Star break after suffering Wednesday's heart-breaking defeat. It looked like the Jazz were going to escape with the win after Hayward's jumper, but the Celtics drew up the right play and Zeller sunk the game winner. Rudy Gobert was dominant on the glass once again, pulling down 16 rebounds to go with 10 points. The Jazz will look to bounce back Friday in Philadelphia. Boston didn't let Tuesday's blowout loss to Cleveland bleed into Wednesday as it notched a tough win against a resurgent Utah club. Isaiah Thomas was effective off the bench again, posting his fifth 20-point performance as a Celtic. Kelly Olynyk returned to action Wednesday, but his impact was minimal as he finished with a rebound and an assist in seven minutes of action. Boston will kick off a three-game road swing Friday in New Orleans. 											",Boston,Celtics,Utah,Jazz,TD Garden,24,36,24,35,8.0,27.0,33.0,88.0,11.0,20.0,39.0,21.0,3.0,3.0,19.0,34.0,75.0,13.0,21.0,51.0,21.0,13.0,Evan Turner,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25,Gordon Hayward,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,36,Brandon Bass,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Derrick Favors,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Tyler Zeller,11.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Rudy Gobert,16.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,35,Avery Bradley,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,35,Joe Ingles,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,24,Marcus Smart,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,14.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,39,Dante Exum,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,18,Jae Crowder,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,17.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,32,Trey Burke,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,31,Isaiah Thomas,3.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,26,Trevor Booker,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,22,Jonas Jerebko,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,18,Rodney Hood,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,21,Kelly Olynyk,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Elijah Millsap,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,James Young,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,7,Jeremy Evans,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

												The Charlotte Hornets (26-33) beat the Brooklyn Nets (25-34) 115-91 on Wednesday.The Hornets put the Nets in an early hole, outscoring them 35-15 in the first quarter. Gerald Henderson and Al Jefferson each had 19 points to lead Charlotte, but it was Mo Williams passing display that led them to victory. Williams dished out 14 assists while committing just one turnover in 31 minutes. He also scored 14 points on 6-of-13 shooting. Charlotte is now 3-0 in March and have won four of their last five games overall.The Nets were coming off a 110-108 victory over the Western Conference leading Golden State Warriors on Monday. They couldn't find anywhere near the same success against Charlotte, who they are currently battling with for one the Eastern Conference's final playoff spots. Deron Williams led his team with 12 points and six assists in what was also a team-high 27 minutes.  The Nets will host the Phoenix Suns on Friday, as the Charlotte Hornets will welcome the Toronto Raptors to town.

												The Toronto Raptors (38-23) fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers (39-24) 120-112 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre. The Cavaliers opened the fourth quarter with a 13-point lead, but the Raptors' Louis Williams sparked the comeback to close the gap, scoring Toronto's first nine points of the final period. Williams torched Cleveland for 21 points in the fourth, but the Raptors couldn't quite finish the comeback. LeBron James came up big with 29 points and 14 assists to lift Cleveland over Toronto to continue its surge towards the top of the Eastern Conference. Cleveland was coming off an easy win Tuesday against Boston, but got everything Toronto could throw its way Wednesday. Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and LeBron James all had over 20 points. The Cavaliers have now won six of their eight games since the All-Star break. Cleveland has a big matchup on the slate Friday as it will travel to Atlanta to square off with the Hawks. Toronoto's skid continued Wednesday after it briefly stopped Monday against Philadelphia. Kyle Lowry was rested yet again, but Greivis Vasquez filled in admirably. Vasquez finished with 13 assists and six points over 40 minutes. Lou Williams was the big story for Toronto with his huge fourth quarter effort. Toronto will look to get back on track Friday in Charlotte as it starts a three-game road swing. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Cleveland,Cavaliers,Scotiabank Arena,39,24,38,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,James Johnson,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,18,LeBron James,6.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,29.0,9.0,16.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,37,Amir Johnson,8.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Kevin Love,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,33,Jonas Valanciunas,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,26.0,12.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Timofey Mozgov,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,DeMar DeRozan,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,10.0,19.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,39,JR Smith,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,36,Greivis Vasquez,3.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,39,Kyrie Irving,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,9.0,17.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,40,Lou Williams,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,29,Iman Shumpert,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,20,Terrence Ross,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,25,Tristan Thompson,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Tyler Hansbrough,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Matthew Dellavedova,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8,Patrick Patterson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,18,James Jones,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,20,Landry Fields,,,,,,,,,,,,Joe Harris,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Memphis Grizzlies (43-17) defeated the Houston Rockets (41-20) 102-100 on Wednesday.James Harden returned from a one-game suspension that was levied against him for kicking LeBron James in the groin in the Rockets' overtime win over the Cavaliers on Sunday. Harden flashed brilliance passing the ball, handing out 13 helpers, but he was less prolific scoring the ball, finishing with 18 points on 7-of-16 shooting in his 41 minutes. Terrence Jones continues to excel with Dwight Howard (knee) sidelined. Jones scored a team-high 21 points and pulled down nine rebounds in 36 minutes. The Rockets and Grizzlies were evenly matched in most regards, but the Grizzlies gained an advantage by coaxing the Rockets into 15 personal fouls. There was a controversial no-call on Harden as he drove to the hoop and appeared to be fouled. The Grizzlies came away with the ball, called a timeout and advanced the ball before Marc Gasol hit a game-winning two-point shot.Memphis went to the line 17 times compared to the Rockets' five trips to the charity stripe. Zach Randolph (illness), Beno Udrih (illness) and Tony Allen (team-imposed suspension) were back in action after sitting out the Grizzlies' loss to the Jazz on Tuesday. Gasol led the way Wednesday, putting up a team-high 21 points to go with seven rebounds and six assists. The win moved the Grizzlies slightly closer to the West-leading Warriors, putting them just four games behind them for the top playoff seed. Houston dropped into a momentary tie for third place with the Trail Blazers that will change when the Blazers finish their big matchup with the Clippers later on the Wednesday slate. The Grizzlies will try to make it two straight wins when they return home to host the Lakers on Friday, and the Rockets will be looking to stop their two-game skid when they host the Pistons on Friday.

												The Denver Nuggets (22-39) won their second-straight game Wednesday with a 100-85 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves (13-47) 100-85 at the Target Center. It appeared as though Denver had hit rock bottom earlier in the week with its sixth straight loss since the All-Star break, which resulted in coach Brian Shaw being relieved of his duties. The Nuggets have responded with two wins in two nights after holding the Bucks and Timberwolves under 100 and 90 points respectively. Kenneth Faried was big for Denver, putting up 18 points and 14 rebounds. The Nuggets won the season-series against the Timberwolves 3-1. Denver managed to record a 15-point victory despite an unusual performance from one of its best players. Ty Lawson, who averages 16 points-per-game, went scoreless on 0-of-9 shooting, but still nearly managed a double-double after adding nine assists and seven rebounds. Denver will travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Friday. Minnesota has been playing better than its record would suggest of late, but still couldn't finish with a victory Wednesday. Nikola Pekovic and Kevin Martin returned to action Wednesday, but made little impact. Pekovic had six points in 15 minutes and Kevin Martin was 3-for-15 from the floor on the way to scoring nine points. The Timberwolves will return to action Saturday against Portland.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (33-28) made the most of Anthony Davis' return Wednesay with an 88-85 victory over the Detroit Pistons (23-37) at the Smoothie King Center. Anthony Davis had been out since Feb. 21 after re-injuring his shoulder against Miami, but came back in a big way Wednesday. Davis made his presence felt with 39 points, 13 rebounds, and a remarkable eight blocks. The Pistons made a late run, tying the game at 81 with just over a minute to go, but Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evans made the difference for the Pelicans. New Orleans had a great run in Davis' absence, winning five out of six games without its young super star. The Pelicans continue to battle for the eighth seed in the West, with the Thunder and Suns all vying for that final spot. Alexis Ajinca had his second-straight double-double off the bench Wednesday with 10 points and 11 rebounds. The Pelicans will return to action Friday when they host the Celtics. Detroit was coming off extended rest Wednesday, having last played Saturday against Washington. The rest didn't translate to a favorable result, however, as the Pistons dropped their fourth straigh game. The current losing streak makes Detroit's playoff chances tenable at best as Indiana, Brooklyn, and Boston are all ahead of the Pistons. The Pistons will look to snap their losing skid Friday in Houston. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Detroit,Pistons,Smoothie King Center,23,37,33,28,2.0,12.0,37.0,90.0,12.0,16.0,46.0,18.0,14.0,2.0,14.0,38.0,93.0,7.0,9.0,51.0,25.0,18.0,Quincy Pondexter,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,31,Tayshaun Prince,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,29,Anthony Davis,13.0,2.0,3.0,8.0,39.0,17.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,41,Greg Monroe,15.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,36,Omer Asik,11.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Andre Drummond,18.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,13.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Eric Gordon,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,31,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,24,Tyreke Evans,4.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,20.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,35,Reggie Jackson,5.0,11.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,32,Alexis Ajinca,11.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Spencer Dinwiddie,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,15,Norris Cole,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,27,Anthony Tolliver,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,14,Dante Cunningham,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Caron Butler,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Luke Babbitt,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Jodie Meeks,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,27,Jimmer Fredette,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Shawne Williams,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (34-27) beat the Philadelphia 76ers (13-48) 123-118 in overtime on Wednesday.Russell Westbrook put on another miraculous performance on Wednesday. He was forced to sit out Monday's win over the Los Angeles Lakers while he recovered from a facial injury that he suffered in the final moments of Friday's loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. Over his last three games he's averaging 42.7 points, 14.3 rebounds and 10.7 assists and has recorded four straight double-doubles overall. He finished with 49 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals and one block in their win over the Sixers. Westbrook has led the Thunder to a 4-2 record without Kevin Durant, whose been out with a foot injury and has not played since Feb. 19.The 76ers nearly pulled off the upset and even forced overtime against a solid Oklahoma City team, that has a record over .500 in the tough Western Conference. Isaiah Canaan and Jason Richardson combined for 60 points, but it wasn't enough hold off the Thunder and Westbrooks spectacular game. Defensive stalwart Nerlends Noel put on a defensive display. He had 11 defensive rebounds, four steals and five blocks. Philadelphia has lost three games in a row and only have one victory since the All-Star break.The Sixers will welcome the Utah Jazz to town on Friday, as the Thunder will head to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Thursday.    											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Philadelphia,76ers,Chesapeake Energy Arena,13,48,34,27,7.0,21.0,44.0,96.0,28.0,34.0,54.0,19.0,14.0,15.0,35.0,34.0,96.0,35.0,44.0,58.0,20.0,17.0,Kyle Singler,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Luc Mbah a Moute,14.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,21.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,39,Serge Ibaka,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,30,JaKarr Sampson,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Enes Kanter,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Nerlens Noel,13.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,40,Andre Roberson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Isaiah Canaan,7.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,31.0,10.0,16.0,8.0,13.0,3.0,41,Russell Westbrook,15.0,10.0,3.0,1.0,49.0,16.0,33.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,42,Jason Richardson,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,29.0,8.0,19.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,35,Dion Waiters,10.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,39,Jerami Grant,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,14.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,28,Nick Collison,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Hollis Thompson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,18,Anthony Morrow,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,15,Thomas Robinson,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Mitch McGary,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Henry Sims,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,D.J.

												The Miami Heat (27-33) beat the Los Angeles Lakers (16-44) 100-94 on Wednesday.Hassan Whiteside continued his break out season with a phenomenal 25-rebound performance. He also had 18 points and four blocks in 33 minutes of action. Goran Dragic helped his big man out by putting up 21 points, four rebounds, six assists, three steals and one block in a well rounded game for the new Miami point guard. Veterans Luol Deng and Dwyane Wade combined for 40 points, and 11 boards to help give the Heat a victory as they try and fight to secure a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.The starting frontcourt for the Lakers ended Wednesday's game with the same amount as their starting point guard Jordan Clarkson. He had seven rebounds which tied the likes of Carlos Boozer, Ryan Kelly and Robert Sacre. Clarkson also had 10 points and five assists but also shot just 3-for-11 and committed seven turnovers. Ed Davis and Jordan Hill came off the bench and each had a double-double. They combined for 27 points and 22 rebounds to try and overcome the lack of rebounding from the starters, outside of Clarkson. The Lakers have dropped three in a row after they won three straight to end the month of February.The Memphis Grizzlies will host the Lakers on Friday, as the Heat will head to Washington to take on the Wizards.

												The San Antonio Spurs (37-23) routed the Sacramento Kings (21-38) 112-83 on Wednesday at the AT&T Center. San Antonio fans hadn't gotten to watch their team play a home game since Feb. 6 against Miami, but Wednesday's performance was worth the wait. The Spurs were down 27-26 after the first quarter, but held the Kings to just 11 points in the second as they took over the game. Kawhi led the way with 21 points to help give the Spurs their second win over the Kings in less than a week. Sacramento kicked off a huge eight-game road trip on Tuesday with a convincing 124-86 victory over New York. The Kings couldn't match that effort Wednesday, however, as they were handled by the Spurs. DeMarcus Cousins had a subpar game by his standards, posting just 14 points and three rebounds to go with five turnovers. Sacramento will resume its road trip Friday in Orlando. Questions about San Antonio's chances this season started to swirl after it dropped its fifth game on its rodeo road trip. Since then, the Spurs have looked like the team that everyone figured would be a contender in the West with three-straight double-digit wins. Marco Belinelli and Manu Ginobili both scored 13 off the bench Wednesday. The Spurs also played suffocating defense, holding the Kings to just 37 percent from the field. San Antonio will return to action Friday when it hosts Denver. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Sacramento,Kings,AT&T Center,21,38,37,23,10.0,23.0,42.0,80.0,11.0,15.0,36.0,21.0,16.0,3.0,9.0,29.0,78.0,22.0,32.0,35.0,15.0,17.0,Kawhi Leonard,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,28,Rudy Gay,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,26,Tim Duncan,6.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Jason Thompson,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Tiago Splitter,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,DeMarcus Cousins,3.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,22,Danny Green,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,22,Ben McLemore,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,39,Tony Parker,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Ray McCallum,7.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,12.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Patty Mills,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,16,Derrick Williams,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,18,Manu Ginobili,6.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,20,Omri Casspi,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Boris Diaw,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,23,Andre Miller,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,18,Aron Baynes,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Nik Stauskas,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,18,Marco Belinelli,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,25,Ryan Hollins,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13

												The Golden State Warriors (47-12) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (32-29) 102-93.The Warriors play at home this season has been stellar. They are 25-2 at Oracle Arena and they continued their winning ways on Wednesday. Draymond Green led his team in four categories. He had 23 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks in 40 minutes. Green also had three steals and five assists to complete a great all-around performance. Green will look to build upon his game against the Bucks as Golden State will host the Dallas Mavericks on Friday. The Bucks managed to keep Stephen Curry in check during the first three quarters. He still managed to find success passing the ball, ending with 11 assists. He broke out in the fourth, scoring 12 of his 19 points in the final period to nail the coffin in Milwaukee's chances at a win on a very tough west coast road trip. Their record was 31-23 on Feb. 20, but After going 1-6 over their last seven, they're now 32-29.  They will look to try and help themselves surpass the Washington Wizards in the Eastern Conference standings when the Bucks host the Wizards on Saturday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Milwaukee,Bucks,Chase Center,32,29,47,12,14.0,34.0,37.0,73.0,14.0,25.0,34.0,30.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,Harrison Barnes,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,31,Giannis Antetokounmpo,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,40,Draymond Green,12.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,23.0,9.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,40,Jared Dudley,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,29,Andrew Bogut,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,19,Zaza Pachulia,11.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Klay Thompson,0.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,16.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,36,Khris Middleton,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,29,Stephen Curry,1.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,19.0,6.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,5.0,36,Michael Carter-Williams,4.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,30,Andre Iguodala,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,29,Ersan Ilyasova,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,35,Justin Holiday,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,John Henson,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,David Lee,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,Jerryd Bayless,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,25,Shaun Livingston,1.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Tyler Ennis,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,14,Festus Ezeli,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,O.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (40-22) fell to the Portland Trail Blazers (40-19) 98-93 in a thriller at the Staples Center on Wednesday. In a matchup of two of the league's top point guards in Chris Paul and Damian Lillard, Paul had the upper hand all night. Paul finished with a season-high 36 points while Lillard had one of his most frustrating outings of the season. Lillard was stifled throughout the game as Los Angeles collapsed on him seemingly every time he touched the ball. He didn't make a field goal until two minutes had passed in overtime. Despite Lillard's struggles, Portland was able to tie it up late after Los Angeles' Hedo Turkgolu over-pursued on a pass, which allowed Nicolas Batum to drain a wide-open three. In a strange turn of events, DeAndre Jordan had a lapse in clock awareness on Los Angeles' final possession, which cost the Clippers a chance to win it in regulation. The Blazers were resilient in overtime as they rallied to a big victory.  Portland had dropped both games against Los Angeles entering Wednesday, but hung around long enough to take the lead late and steal the road win. Where Lillard struggled from the field (1-13 FG), Nicolas Batum was clutch down the stretch and in overtime as he ended up with 20 points, eight assists, and seven rebounds. Interestingly, Lillard nearly matched DeAndre Jordan's rebounding total, pulling down 18 rebounds compared to Jordan's 19. The Trail Blazers don't have much time to enjoy this victory as they host the Mavericks on Thursday. Los Angeles had its three-game winning streak snapped due to a late collapse where they couldn't close out Portland. Doc Rivers ran a shallow rotation, deploying just eight players in the game with Jamal Crawford and Blake Griffin sidelined with injuries. DeAndre Jordan now has 10 straight games with more than 15 rebounds The Clippers will get an extended break before returning to action Sunday against the Warriors.

												The Sacramento Kings (21-37) defeated the New York Knicks (12-47) 124-86 on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Kings dominated this game offensively right from the beginning, out-scoring the Knicks 65-39 by half, and reaching the 100-point mark after just the third quarter. Their superior shooting was a big reason for this, as they went 49 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three-point line, while the Knicks finished at 37 percent from the floor and just 18 percent from deep. Along with that, the Kings also secured a 46-38 rebounding advantage, only furthering their impressive performance Tuesday.The Kings saw six players reach double figures in this one, along with three reaching the 20-point plateau. Rudy Gay led the way, going 9-for-15 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 25 points, to go along with seven rebounds and four assists in just 26 minutes. He's now shot 40 percent or higher in each of his last four games, a span where he's averaging 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds. DeMarcus Cousins also was a big factor in the win, finishing with 22 points (5-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 11-11 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. Like Gay, he's been a beast lately, averaging 23.6 points and 11.4 rebounds over his last five games. Both players could have put up some even higher numbers in this matchup, but because of the blowout, they were each held to less than 30 minutes on the court. Ben McLemore was also very efficient with his time, scoring 20 points (6-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 6-7 FT) in just 23 minutes. He's picked up his game of late, recording two 20-point games over his last three, despite averaging just 11.9 points on the season. Coming off the bench, Derrick Williams and Nik Stauskas reached double figures as well with 17 and 15 points respectively.As shown by their final score, the Knicks struggled to get much going Tuesday, including having all five of their starters combine for just 24 points. With that being said, they did see some solid contributions off their bench. Alexey Shved led the team in scoring, posting 15 points (4-11 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 7-9 FT), to go along with seven rebounds and three assists in 32 minutes. It was a season-high in minutes for the guard, as he took advantage of the extra time with his second 15-point showing in a row. Shane Larkin was also one of those bench players who provided some points. He went 5-for-9 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to finish with 13 points, while adding six assists and two steals as well. It was just the sixth time all season that he finished in double-digit points. The only other Knick to reach double figures was Jason Smith, who posted 13 points (6-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT), four rebounds and three blocked shots in 21 minutes.The Kings' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, while the Knicks will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (25-33) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (16-43) 104-103 on Tuesday. The two teams went wire-to-wire, but the Hornets were able to pull away just enough in the final five minutes of the game. Charlotte held a five-point lead with just seven seconds remaining, and the Lakers just ran out of time in attempting a last-second comeback.Mo Williams scored eight of Charlotte's final nine points in the last minute of the game and finished with 20 points and a game-high 13 assists. Al Jefferson was also very effective in the winning effort for the Hornets, putting up 21 points on 9-of-19 shooting and 16 rebounds in 37 minutes.

It also didn't help that the Celtics turned the ball over 16 times, while forcing the Cavs into just 11.LeBron James had himself a day Wednesday, going 12-for-23 from the field and 3-for-3 from the free throw line to finish with 27 points, while adding five assists and three steals in just 26 minutes. He's been absolutely on fire of late, averaging 35.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and three steals per game over his last three outings. Returning to the starting lineup after missing two games with a strained left shoulder, Kyrie Irving showed no signs of still being affected by the injury. In 26 minutes, he posted 18 points (6-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT), five assists and two steals. He could've recorded even higher numbers, but considering the blow out and the recent injury, he was limited to just under 25 minutes on the court. Coming just shy of a double-double, Kevin Love finished with 12 points (4-10 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds in 24 minutes. Like both Irving and James, he could've had a lot more production, but the Cavaliers were up by so much, that the coaching staff felt it was necessary to rest the starters. He's now averaging 17.0 points and 10.2 rebounds on the season. Tristan Thompson added 10 points on 4-of-4 shooting from the field, to go along with seven rebounds as well.As shown by their final score, the Celtics really struggled to find a source of scoring. Brandon Bass was one of the only consistent options in this game, as he went 7-for-15 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 15 points, while adding five rebounds as well. He's had a nice start to March offensively, recording two games in a row with 15 points.The only other Celtic to reach double figures was Isaiah Thomas, who came off the bench for 11 points (4-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt 3-4 FT) and two assists in just 20 minutes. Since joining the Celtics just six games ago, he's been arguably their best source of scoring, averaging 20.0 points over that six game span. Also off the bench, rookie James Young posted nine points (2-5 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-3FT) in just 17 minutes. Other than Bass, the Celtics starters combined for just 19 points, which won't win any team very many ball games.The Cavaliers' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, while the Celtics will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (48-12) defeated the Houston Rockets 104-96 (41-19) on Tuesday in Atlanta. The Hawks' dominant fourth quarter led them to victory, outscoring the Rockets 32-15 in the final period. The Rockets were without MVP-candidate James Harden on Tuesday and could have used him down the stretch, such as when the game was tied at 96 with two minutes remaining and Atlanta ended the game on an 8-0 run because the Rockets didn't have a go-to scorer.The Hawks were led by Jeff Teague who, after sitting out their last game with a thigh injury, recorded a game-high 25 points on 7-for-12 shooting and six assists in 31 minutes. Atlanta was able to win the game at the free-throw line, going 18-for-21 while the Rockets shot just 4-for-9 from the stripe. Paul Millsap posted a double-double, putting up 16 points and 14 assists in 33 minutes, and Dennis Schroder had a nice performance off the bench for Atlanta, posting 16 points, eight assists, and four rebounds in 27 minutes. As a team, the Hawks shot 45.3 percent from the field and 27.6 percent from three.Jason Terry led the Rockets in scoring in Harden's absence, scoring 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting in 28 minutes off the bench. Houston's starting frontcourt of Terrence Jones and Donatas Motiejunas put together solid outings in the loss. Motiejunas had 14 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, and three steals in 35 minutes, while Jones recorded 18 points on 8-for-11 shooting and eight rebounds in 37 minutes.As a team, the Rockets shot 41 threes, but only made 14 of them, and they shot 43 percent from the field overall. Up next, the Rockets will head back home Wednesday to take on the Grizzlies, while the Hawks will stay home to take on the red-hot Cavaliers on Friday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Houston,Rockets,State Farm Arena,41,19,48,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DeMarre Carroll,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,35,Trevor Ariza,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,37,Paul Millsap,14.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,32,Terrence Jones,8.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,18.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,Al Horford,8.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,18.0,9.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,36,Donatas Motiejunas,8.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,14.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,34,Kyle Korver,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,30,Corey Brewer,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,30,Jeff Teague,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,31,Patrick Beverley,5.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,33,Pero Antic,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,12,Josh Smith,7.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,14.0,6.0,14.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,24,Kent Bazemore,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,20,Jason Terry,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,28,Dennis Schroder,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,14.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,26,Pablo Prigioni,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,13,Mike Scott,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,14,Joey Dorsey,,,,,,,,,,,,Elton Brand,,,,,,,,,,,,James Harden,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Chicago Bulls (38-23) defeated the Washington Wizards 104-96 (24-27) on Tuesday in Chicago. The Bulls, despite dealing with injuries to Derrick Rose (knee), Jimmy Butler (elbow), and Taj Gibson (ankle), were able to pull out a win against a struggling Wizards team. The Bulls were led by rookie Nikola Mirotic, who had a game-high 23 points on 6-of-13 shooting and eight rebounds in 32 minutes off the bench. In his last two games, Mirotic has totaled 52 points and 17 rebounds and has proven to be a viable option off the bench in place of Gibson.Chicago's starting frontcourt of Paul Gasol and Joakim Noah each posted double-doubles. Gasol had 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting and 10 rebounds, while Noah recorded 14 points on 4-of-5 shooting and 12 rebounds.Aaron Brooks got the start in place of Rose and while he shot an unimpressive 8-of-23 from the field, Brooks still finished with 22 points and eight assists in 35 minutes. Tony Snell got the start for Butler but posted just 11 points on 4-of-12 shooting in 40 minutes.The Bulls shot 42.3 percent from the field and had 16 turnovers to just 20 assists. John Wall struggled shooting the ball (8-of-20 from the field) but still managed to put up 21 points, 11 assists and four rebounds in 39 minutes. Marcin Gortat recorded 12 points on 6-of-9 shooting and 12 rebounds. The effort was his second straight double-double and his sixth straight game with double-digit rebounds. Paul Pierce (16), Bradley Beal (13), and Otto Poter Jr. (11) rounded out the Washington players in double figures. As a team, the Wizards shot 41.7 percent from the field and were active defensively, recording 11 blocks and 10 steals. Up next, the Bulls will stay home to take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, while the Wizards head home Friday to take on Miami. 											",Chicago,Bulls,Washington,Wizards,United Center,34,27,38,23,,,,,,,,,,7.0,21.0,34.0,83.0,14.0,19.0,39.0,23.0,11.0,Mike Dunleavy,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,31,Paul Pierce,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,32,Pau Gasol,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,20.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,32,Nene,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Joakim Noah,12.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,14.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,33,Marcin Gortat,12.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33,Tony Snell,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,39,Bradley Beal,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,18.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,35,Aaron Brooks,2.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,23.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,35,John Wall,4.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,21.0,8.0,20.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,38,Nikola Mirotic,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23.0,6.0,13.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,31,Garrett Temple,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Doug McDermott,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Drew Gooden,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11,Kirk Hinrich,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,12,Otto Porter Jr.,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,30,E'Twaun Moore,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Ramon Sessions,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,15,Cameron Bairstow,,,,,,,,,,,,Kevin Seraphin,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15

												The Utah Jazz (24-35) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (42-17) 93-82 on Tuesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.In a surprise performance, the Jazz were able to take down one of the best teams in their conference, while notching their third straight victory as well. They were the superior shooters in this one, going 45 percent from the field, while the Grizzlies finished at 40 percent. The Jazz also secured a hefty advantage on the boards, as they out-rebounded the Grizzlies 55-37, which may have made the biggest difference in their 11-point win on the road in Memphis.As they've done all season long, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively. Hayward went 9-for-19 from the field, but missed all six of his three-point attempts, to finish with 21 points, while adding eight rebounds and six assists as well. He's been absolutely awful from deep over his last five games, going a combined 2-for-20 from the three-point line during that stretch, but he was able to overcome the poor shooting and still finish above his season scoring average of 19.5 points per game. Favors, on the other hand, posted 21 points (8-14 FG, 5-6 FT) of his own, to go along with six rebounds, two steals and three blocked shots. He's stepped it up offensively of late, averaging 19.0 points and 9.3 rebounds over his last four games. He's also posted three blocks in each of his last three games. Notching one of his more impressive lines of his season, Rudy Gobert recorded 15 points (6-10 FG, 3-4 FT) and 24 reobunds in 36 minutes. He looks to be getting more and more comfortable as a member of the starting lineup, posting a double-double in three of his last four games. The rebounds were a season-high. Coming off the bench, Rodney Hood added 13 points (3-5 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT) in 14 minutes.Courtney Lee had the strongest performance of all the Grizzlies' starters. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 2-for-7 from the three-point line to finish with 18 points, while adding five rebounds as well. One of the more inconsistent players on this team, it was one of his better nights, as he averages just 10.9 points per game on the season. Marc Gasol also did everything he could to keep the Grizzlies in this game, as he recorded 17 points (6-15 FG, 5-6 FT) and eight rebounds in 34 minutes. He's had a nice stretch of two games, combining for 44 points and 19 rebounds over that span. Mike Conley reached double figures as well, posting 11 points of his own, but he seemed to struggle with his shot, going just 4-of-11 from the field and 0-for-2 from deep. Coming off the bench, rookie Jordan Adams added 13 points (6-8 FG, 1-1 3Pt) in 23 minutes. The points were a new season-high for the rookie.The Jazz's next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Grizzlies will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Denver Nuggets (21-39) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (32-28) 106-95 on Tuesday in Denver. This was Denver's first game since firing head coach Brian Shaw, which occurred Tuesday morning, but the Nuggets were able to control the game from start to finish. The win ended a seven-game losing streak and was just their third win in 22 games. Denver was led by Danilo Gallinari, who scored a game-high 26 points on 8-of-16 shooting and seven rebounds in a team-high 37 minutes. Gallinari has played very well of late, averaging 20.4 points and 4.4 rebounds over his past five games. Ty Lawson and Kenneth Faried, two players who have had up-and-down years for the Nuggets, both posted double-doubles. Lawson recorded 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting and 10 assists in 31 minutes, while Faried put up 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes. Wilson Chandler (12) was the only other Nugget to score in double figures.As a team, Denver shot 45.3 percent from the field and took advantage of their free-throw attempts, shooting 16-of-20 (80 percent) at the charity stripe. Khris Middleton, although he did not score a point in the fourth quarter, led the way for the Bucks in the losing effort with a solid all-around performance, recording 20 points on 6-of-20 shooting, seven rebounds, and six assists in 37 minutes of play.

												The Toronto Raptors (38-22) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (13-47) 114-103 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.Both teams shot surprisingly well in this one, with the Raptors finishing at 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers went 53 percent from the floor and 40 percent from deep. Despite an evenly played game, the Raptors forced the Sixers into 16 turnovers, while committing just 11 of their own, which may have made just enough of a difference to push the Raptors to a victory on the road in Philadelphia on Monday.Leading the Raptors was DeMar DeRozan, who was nearly unstoppable in this one. He went 12-for-24 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 35 points, while also adding nine rebounds and five assists. DeRozan also forced his way to the free throw line, and converted on a perfect 10-of-10 attempts. After shooting less than 30 percent over his last two games, he finally got things turned around and exploded for a new season-high in points. With Kyle Lowry sitting out on a day of rest, Greivis Vasquez started at the point, finishing with 12 points (5-8 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and five assists. It was his eighteenth start of the season, as he's now pushed his season averages to 9.5 points and 3.6 assists on the year. The Raptors also got a huge boost from their bench though. Louis Williams went off for 21 points (6-15 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 7-7 FT) and five assists in 30 minutes, while Patrick Patterson added 15 points (6-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and four rebounds in 29 minutes.For the Sixers, Nerlens Noel continued with his strong play, posting 17 points on a perfect 7-for-7 from the field and 3-for-4 from the free throw line. He also added seven rebounds and two steals. Over his last three games, he's now averaging 13.7 points and 10.7 rebounds, as he continues to improve as the season wears on. Coming off the bench, Ish Smith finished with 19 points (8-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-3 FT), five rebounds and nine assists. It was far-and-away his best game since joining the Sixers at the trade deadline. Over his first five games since joining Philadelphia, he's averaging 9.8 points and six assists. Also coming off the bench, Thomas Robinson posted an efficient 13 points (6-8 FG, 1-2 FT) and five rebounds in just 14 minutes. It marked just his third time in double figures this season. Starting at point guard, Isaiah Canaan added 14 points (5-12 FG, 4-8 3Pt) and three assists in 25 minutes as well.The Raptors' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, while the Sixers will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Wednesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (25-33) beat the Golden State Warriors (46-12) 110-108 on Monday.The Nets were able to take down the top team in the Western Conference with a big contribution from Brook Lopez, who came off the bench and led his team with 26 points. Brooklyn's defense was able to hold Klay Thompson to just seven points on 3-of-17 shooting, which eliminated one of Golden State's key scoring components. Jarrett Jack came up with a big bucket with under two seconds remaining to break a 108-108 tie. The Warrior's Stephen Curry was unable to convert a drive to the basket with just 1.1 seconds left after Jack's clutch 17-footer. Brooklyn is now 7-5 since Feb. 1. Andrew Bogut had a big night offensively for Golden State. He scored 16 points on 8-of-10 from the floor to go along with eight rebounds and three blocks. Unfortunately for the Warriors, they were only able to get 16 points combined from three of their other four starters. Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green and Thompson went just 5-for-29 from the field, including 2-of-11 from beyond the arc. Steph Curry's 26 points and seven assists weren't enough to help overcome his teammates' poor shooting performances.  Golden State will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, the Nets will welcome the Charlotte Hornets to town on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (26-33) defeated the Phoenix Suns (31-29) 115-98 on Monday.The Heat's Tyler Johnson came out of nowhere to score a game-high 26 points off the bench, 11 of which came in the fourth quarter. Johnson wasn't even on an NBA roster two months ago and hadn't seen the floor since Feb. 23 when he played three minutes against the Philadelphia 76ers. Miami outscored Phoenix 39-24 in the second quarter, which gave them a 14-point lead at halftime, allowing them to get the reserves some well-deserved court time. The Suns' Alex Len got into a bit of a brouhaha with Heat center Hassan Whiteside. The two players got tangled on a play where Whiteside grabbed an offensive rebound and threw it down for the dunk, and then he and Len were ejected for their physical altercation that ensued. The Suns' new shooting guard Brandon Knight faced off against their recently-departed former shooting guard Goran Dragic. Knight played 40 minutes despite a hip pointer he suffered against the San Antonio Spurs over the weekend. He finished with 13 points, seven assists and five turnovers. Dragic played very well in limited time, scoring 21 points in just 15 minutes as he was limited by foul trouble.The Heat will play the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, and the Suns will head to Orlando to take on the Magic.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (40-21) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (13-46) 110-105 on Monday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.The Clippers took off in the first quarter, out-scoring the Timberwolves 36-23. The Timberwolves came right back in the second though and fought their way to a 60-58 lead at the half. With the Clippers back up 108-105 late in the fourth quarter, Gary Neal had a chance to tie the game on a three-pointer with just over 10 seconds left in the game. He went on to miss it though, and Dahntay Jones sealed off the victory with two free throws on the other end for the Clippers. The Clippers were the superior shooters in this one, going 48 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 27 percent from deep.Chris Paul was nearly unguardable in this one, going off for 26 points (12-20 FG, 2-4 3Pt), 14 rebounds and three steals in 37 minutes. He has been absolutely on fire of late, averaging 25.0 points and 12.6 assists over his last three games, as he's really stepped it up in the absence of Blake Griffin. J.J. Redick was also a huge factor in the win. He went 7-for-15 from the field and 4-for-9 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding five rebounds before being ejected late in the fourth quarter for arguing with the referee. He is dialed in with his shot at the moment, shooting over 45 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three-point line in three of his last four games. Notching a double-double of his own, DeAndre Jordan chipped in with 12 points (4-7 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-9 FT) and 18 rebounds. He continues to be an absolute animal on the boards, recording 10 or more rebounds in each of last 10 games, including four games with 20 or more. Both Glen Davis and Austin Rivers reached double figures off the bench with 12 and 13 points respectively.In an all-around solid effort from the bottom feeders of the Western Conference, Ricky Rubio's performance stood out the most, as he finished with his first triple-double of the season. In 39 minutes, he posted 18 points (5-11 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 7-9 FT), 12 rebounds and 11 assists. He came just three rebounds short of a triple-double on Saturday, so he was able to finally get over the hump and complete the feat. Gary Neal also had a strong showing, recording 19 points (6-17 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 5-6 FT), nine rebounds and four assists. He's picked up his scoring over his last two outings, combining for 35 points over that span. Andrew Wiggins chipped in with 18 points (5-16 FG, 8-10 FT), four assists and two steals. His impressive stretch of games continues, as he's averaging 21.0 points over his last six games.

												The Dallas Mavericks (40-22) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (32-28) 102-93 on Monday.Dallas was without big man Tyson Chandler, who was out with a hip injury. Coach Rick Carlisle gave Bernard James the start at center. James had two blocks, six rebounds and zero points but led his team with a plus-23 rating during his time on the court. Rajon Rondo pitched in with 19 points on a team-best 9-for-15 shooting night from the field. The recently-acquired Amar'e Stoudemire came off the bench and put up 14 points to go along with four rebounds, two assists and two steals. The Mavs are 8-5 since the beginning of February, and they'll begin a three-game road trip on Thursday against the Portland Trail Blazers.The Pelicans were lead in points by Norris Cole. Cole came off the bench and scored 19 points in 36 minutes, but it wasn't enough to extend New Orleans' win streak to six games, ending it at five. The five-game span started with the re-injuring of Anthony Davis' shoulder, and he remains out without a firm timetable for his return. The Pelicans will look to begin a new streak when they welcome the Detroit Pistons to the Smoothie King Center on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (39-21) defeated the Chicago Bulls (37-23) 96-86 on Sunday.Los Angeles have won two straight games and are 6-3 since Blake Griffin started sitting out games following surgery to remove an infection in his elbow. DeAndre Jordan continued his torrid work on the glass, pulling down 26 rebounds in 41 minutes. With Griffin out, Jordan has stepped up his game. He's recorded four games of 20-plus rebounds over his last nine contests. Chris Paul has also picked up his game to cover the team's holes. Paul put up a team-high 29 points and 12 assists Sunday and has recorded double-digit assists in eight of his last nine games.Chicago were playing without Derrick Rose (knee) and Taj Gibson (ankle) on Sunday, and without Rose to initiate the offense, the team struggled, shooting 31 percent from the field. Pau Gasol returned to action, playing through the illness that held him out of Friday's game, but he had trouble against the Clippers' defense, shooting 2-for-13 from the field in 33 minutes to finish with just four points. He worked the glass for 15 rebounds, but with their shots not falling, the Bulls couldn't make up the slack elsewhere. Aaron Brooks started a second straight game in place of Rose, who is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks following knee surgery. Brooks finished with 14 points on 5-of-17 shooting from the field. With Gibson unavailable, Nikola Mirotic put up a game-high 29 points in 31 minutes off the bench. The Clippers and Bulls split their season series 1-1, with the Bulls having taken their first matchup 105-89 back on Nov. 17. Los Angeles will wrap up their road trip against the Timberwolves on Monday, and Chicago will stay home to host the Wizards on Tuesday.

												The Houston Rockets (41-18) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (37-24) 105-103 on Sunday at the Toyota Center in Houston.After a fourth quarter comeback, where the Cavaliers out-scored the Rockets 24-16, LeBron James had a chance to end the game, but missed a step back jump shot with just under two seconds left in regulation, pushing it to overtime. The Rockets then were able to build a two-point lead by the end of overtime. James Jones had a chance to win the game for the Cavaliers with a three at the buzzer, but had it blocked, therefore giving the Rockets their fifth win in a row. The Rockets were the superior shooters in this one, going 46 percent from the field and 37 percent from the three-point line, while the Cavaliers went 41 percent from the floor and just 30 percent from deep.Like has been the case so far this season, James Harden led this Rockets team to the win. He finished with a team-high of 33 points (8-18 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 15-18 FT), to go along with eight rebounds, five assists and three steals. He continually forced his way to the free throw line, as the Cavaliers just couldn't stay in front of him. After shooting just 27 percent (4-15 FG) in Friday's game against the Nets, it was a much better showing for the guard from the field Sunday. Terrence Jones was also a huge factor in the win, posting 19 points (6-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-9 FT) and seven rebounds. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 45 points and 19 rebounds over his last two games. He's now averaging 11.2 points and 6.7 rebounds on the season. Getting hot from the field, Donatas Motiejunas went 7-for-14 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while adding two rebounds. He's been scoring at a high rate lately, averaging 15.0 points over his last three games.With Kyrie Irving out due to a shoulder injury, the bulk of the scoring went to both LeBron James and Kevin Love. James went 15-for-35 from the field and 4-for-12 from the three-point line to score 37 points, to go along with eight rebounds, four assists and three steals. He's been playing at a very high rate lately, averaging 39.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and three steals over his last two games. Love, on the other hand, finished with 21 points (8-19 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT), six rebounds and three assists in 35 minutes. He's now averaging 17.0 points, 10.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists on the year. Coming off the bench, Tristan Thompson made a strong impact. In 37 minutes, he posted 14 points (5-9 FG, 4-4 FT) and a game-high of 19 rebounds. The 19 rebounds were a new season-high, while the double-double was his first since the end of January.The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday, while the Rockets will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Tuesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (39-19) defeated the Sacramento Kings (20-37) 110-99 on Sunday.Portland dropped two games coming out of the All-Star break, but they've since rattled off three consecutive wins. Damian Lillard lead the way with a game-high 31 points and seven assists and got some help from LaMarcus Aldridge putting up 26 points and 15 rebounds of his own. Backup center Joel Freeland played for the first time since Jan. 3, missing 24 games with a strained right shoulder. The Blazers are in fourth place in the Western Conference standings.Sacramento has had to play their last two games without DeMarcus Cousins as he continues to rest ankle and hip injuries, losing both games. Cousins is averaging 23.7 points per game this season, and the starting frontcourt of Carl Landry and Jason Thompson on Sunday could muster only seven combined points in 34 minutes. Rudy Gay tried to pick up the slack, scoring a team-high 24 points, and Derrick Williams pitched in 18 points off the bench, but without Cousins, the Kings didn't have enough rations to survive the Blazers on Sunday. They've gone 2-3 since George Karl took over the coaching reigns after the All-Star break. Sunday's game was the final matchup the Blazers and Kings will have this season, with the Blazers taking the season series 2-1.Portland will continue their road trip against the Clippers on Wednesday, and Sacramento will embark on an eight-game road trip that starts in New York on Tuesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (46-11) defeated the Boston Celtics (23-34) 106-101 on Sunday at the TD Garden in Boston.The Celtics got off to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Warriors 38-25 in the first quarter alone. They looked to have the game locked up coming out of the third quarter when they had a 86-75 lead. The Warriors had other plans though and went on to out-score the Celtics 31-15 in the final quarter, therefore securing a five-point victory on the road in Boston. The Warriors shot 42 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Celtics finished at 37 percent from the floor and just 26 percent from deep.The Warriors' superstar backcourt duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson did it again on Sunday. Curry led all scorers, finishing with 37 points (14-22 FG, 5-8 3Pt, 4-4 FT), to go along with four rebounds and five assists in 37 minutes. He's been on fire lately, averaging 27.3 points and six assists over his last four games. Thompson, on the other hand, added 20 points (9-23 FG, 2-10 3Pt) and five rebounds as well. After shooting 60 percent or higher from the three-point line over his last two games, combining to go 8-for-13 over those two matchups, Thompson really took a step back and made just 2-of-10 from deep on Sunday. It didn't have much of an effect in the end though, as the Warriors still came out victorious. Harrison Barnes was a big factor as well, going 6-for-14 from the field and 3-for-7 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while adding eight rebounds in 30 minutes. It was the most points he's scored since January sixteenth, so we'll see if he's able to continue with the momentum moving forward. Draymond Green added 14 points (4-13 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and 11 rebounds.The Celtics had a true team effort in this one, with six players reaching double figures in points. It wasn't enough though, as they couldn't slow down the Warriors in the fourth quarter. Recently acquired Isaiah Thomas was the team's scoring leader. He came off the bench to record 20 points (8-21 FG, 3-11 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and five assists in 29 minutes. He's been a huge contributor for the Celtics since the trade, averaging 21.8 points and 5.8 assists over five games. Tyler Zeller also played well as the starter at center. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-3 from the free throw line to score 17 points, while adding six rebounds and a blocked shot as well. After combining for just 15 points over his last two matchups, it was good to see him step it up offensively. He's now averaging 9.9 points and 5.6 rebounds on the season. Getting the start at forward, Brandon Bass notched a double-double with 15 points (6-12 FG, 3-4 FT) and 12 rebounds. It was his eighteenth start of the year, while the double-double marked his third of the season. Jae Crowder added nine points (4-17 FG, 1-7 3Pt) and a team-high of 17 rebounds off the bench.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday, while the Celtics will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Tuesday.

												The Indiana Pacers (25-34) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (13-46) 94-74 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.The Pacers got out to a quick start in this game, grabbing a 59-46 lead at half, therefore giving them a comfortable lead for the rest of the game. Along with the hot start, the Pacers were also the superior shooters, going 41 percent from the field, compared to the Sixers who finished at just 35 percent. The Pacers forced the Sixers in 18 turnovers, while committing just 14 of their own, which may have also played a big factor in the win.George Hill had a strong showing on Sunday, finishing with a team-high of 17 points (8-16 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 0-2 FT), to go along with nine rebounds and four assists. He was coming off a triple-double on Friday, where he recorded 15 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists, so he continued to put up some solid numbers over all three categories in this one. Hill also received some help for Roy Hibbert, who posted 14 points (5-12 FG, 4-5 FT), 15 rebounds and five blocked shots in 31 minutes. The double-double was his first since the start of February, while he also made a huge impact on the defensive side of the ball, as he continually kept the Sixers out of the lane. The Pacers did see a bunch of production from their bench as well, with both Rodney Stuckey and Luis Scola reaching double figures in points. Scola had 15 points (7-12 FG, 1-1 FT) and six rebounds, while Stuckey posted 12 points (4-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT), four assists and three steals. Stuckey has had a nice couple of games in a row, combining for 31 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists over his last two.The Sixers really struggled to get it going offensively. Robert Covington had the most production, finishing with 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and three rebounds. He could've had more, but he had to leave the game late in the third quarter after suffering an elbow contusion. Nerlens Noel also did whatever he could to give the Sixers a boost. In 34 minutes, he recorded 10 points (2-8 FG, 6-6 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots. The double-double was his second in a row, as he's combined for 24 points and 25 rebounds over that span. He's now averaging 8.6 points and 7.3 rebounds on the season. The third member of the starting lineup to reach double figures was Jason Richardson. Richardson finished with 10 points (4-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT), three reobunds and two steals in 26 minutes. After shooting over 44 percent in each of his last two games, he really struggled this time around, going just 33 percent from the field and a meager 20 percent from beyond the arc. Ish Smith added 11 points (5-13 FG, 1-1 3Pt), four rebounds and five assists in 24 minutes off the bench.  The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Knicks on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Monday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (24-33) defeated the Orlando Magic (19-42) 98-83 on Sunday.Charlotte has won two of their last three games as they've started to find a groove with interim starting point guard Mo Williams. He scored 23 points and dished out 11 assists in 38 minutes against the Magic to record his second double-double since joining the Hornets five games ago. Williams  has played well, but the Hornets are looking forward to getting Kemba Walker back in the fold. Walker underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee on Jan. 28 and was given a 4-6 week timetable to return. He'll be evaluated Wednesday by the Hornets, and if all goes well, a more definitive return date could be revealed to get Walker back in the lineup. Big man Bismack Biyombo returned to action Sunday after being out with a knee injury since Jan. 24. Biyombo put up three rebounds and one block in 14 minutes off the bench. The Hornets are tied with the Brooklyn Nets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East, but they also have the Pacers, Celtics and Pistons within two games of them, fighting for the final playoff spot. Orlando is seven games behind the Hornet and Nets, putting them all-but out of the playoff conversation this late in the season. They've lost three straight, and while the team has played great defense recently, holding nine straight opponents to under 100 points scored, their struggles on offense have kept them out of the win column most nights. Victor Oladipo was the lone bright spot in the starting lineup Sunday, scoring a team-high 21 points and five assists in 38 minutes. The Magic won the first two games of their season series with the Hornets, but Charlotte tied everything up with Sunday's win to close up the season series in a 2-2 tie.Charlotte will return home to host the Lakers on Tuesday, and Orlando will host the Suns on Wednesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (33-27) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (16-42) 108-101 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The Thunder got out to a quick start Sunday, out-scoring the Lakers 28-19 right away in the first quarter. That was really important for the Thunder, as the Lakers ended up as the better shooting team. The Lakers finished at 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Thunder went 41 percent from the floor and 34 percent from deep. The Thunder did finish with a 54-49 rebounding advantage though, which may have been just enough of an edge to overcome the Lakers push.This was a big win for the Thunder, who had lost two games in a row. To make things worse, they were also without both Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, so they had some role players really step up. D.J. Augustin was a big reason for the success without the Thunders' superstars. Starting at point guard, he finished with 18 points (6-15 FG, 4-10 3Pt, 2-2 FT), eight rebounds and five assists. It was far-and-away his best showing since coming over to the Thunder at the trade deadline just six games ago. It was also a very timely performance, considering the injury woes. Serge Ibaka was also a huge factor in the win, posting 18 points (6-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-7 FT) of his own, to go along with 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. He's picked it up offensively of late, averaging 17.9 points over his last seven games. Enes Kanter also took advantage of a good matchup against the Lakers' frontcourt. He finished with 16 points (6-10 FG, 4-6 FT), 15 rebounds and five assists, notching his third double-double since joining the Thunder. In the five games since the trade deadline, he's averaging 15.8 points and 10.2 rebounds.The Lakers saw a ton of production from their bench Sunday. Jeremy Lin was a big reason the Lakers had a chance at a win. He went 7-for-14 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to finish with a game-high of 20 points, while adding six rebounds and eight assists in a near triple-double. He's picked his game up for the Lakers lately, averaging 16.8 points and six assists over his last four outings. Also off the bench, Jordan Hill posted 14 points (5-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and 12 rebounds. Despite coming off the bench, he's stayed prodcutive and has combined for 44 points over his last three games. He's now averaging 12.3 points and 7.9 rebounds on the season. Running with the starters, both Jordan Clarkson and Wayne Ellington had some success. Clarkson finished with 12 points (5-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and four assists, while Ellington had 12 points (5-15 FG, 1-8 3Pt, 1-3 FT), six rebounds and six assists.The Thunder's next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, while the Lakers will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Tuesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (32-27) defeated the Denver Nuggets (20-39) 99-92 on Sunday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Coming out of the third quarter, the game was tied at 65-65 and anyones to lose. The Pelicans got hot in the fourth though, and out-scored the Nuggets 34-27 to finish off the game and steal a road win in Denver. The Pelicans shot 49 percent from the field, while the Nuggets finished at just 49 percent. The Pelicans also made a huge difference at the free throw line, making 22-of-30, while the Nuggets made just 9-of-17.The Pelicans were again without both Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson Sunday. Their backcourt picked up the slack this time around. Tyreke Evans led the charge, going 7-for-14 from the field to score a team-high of 22 points, while adding seven rebounds and seven assists. He had recorded three straight double-doubles coming into this matchup, but he wasn't able to keep the streak alive. Over his last four games, he's averaging 17.3 points and 10.3 assists. Eric Gordon had a strong showing as well, finishing with 18 points (6-14 FG, 3-10 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and two assists in 32 minutes. He's now combined for 38 points and 10 assists over his last two games. Starting in place of Davis, Dante Cunningham posted 14 points (7-12 FG) and seven rebounds. Despite averaging only 5.5 points on the season, he's played well in extended time lately, reaching double figures in points in three straight games. Both Alexis Ajinca and Norris Cole added 10 points off the bench.The Nuggets saw their biggest production from Danilo Gallinari, who finished with 21 points (7-18 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and four rebounds. With so many injuries and shake-ups to the starting lineup, he's been one of the few consistent players, posting 20 or more points in three of his last four games. Over those four games, he's averaging 19.0 points and 3.8 rebounds. Getting the start at shooting guard with the Nuggets using a small lineup due to Jusuf Nurkic's injury, Randy Foye was very successful in extended minutes. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 5-for-10 from the three-point line to score 19 points, to go along with two steals in 29 minutes. It marked just the fourth time this season he reached double figures in points, so it was a nice surprise for the Nuggets. Coming off the bench, Will Barton continued with his impressive stretch. In 20 minutes, he double-doubled with 16 points (7-14 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-3 FT), 10 rebounds and two steals.

												The short-handed Atlanta Hawks (47-12) notched their league-leading 47th win of the season Saturday, defeating the Miami Heat (25-33) 93-91 at the American Airlines Arena.When Kent Bazemore buried a three-pointer with just over a minute left in the fourth, the air went out of the American Airlines Arena. The Heat recovered from a 15-point deficit in the first half to make this game competitive, but the comeback effort fell short. The game got off to a rocky start, with the Hawks leading 17-12 at the end of the first quarter. The Hawks rested starters Demarre Carroll, Jeff Teague, and Al Horford for this contest, but the reserves stepped up in their absence. Dennis Schroder and Kent Bazemore had 16 and 15 points respectively as the Hawks staved off a late charge from Miami. Atlanta has gotten back on track with four consecutive victories after being blown out by Toronto in its first game back from the break. Along with Schroder and Bazemore's big outings, John Jenkins contributed 12 points and seven rebounds. Elton Brand stepped into the starting lineup and added seven points and eight rebounds. The Hawks will return to action Tuesday against the Rockets. Miami lost its second game in as many nights as it fell to Atlanta for the third time this season on Saturday. Hassan Whiteside's incredible 14-point, 24-rebound outing wasn't enough to negate Miami's poor shooting effort. Miami finished the game shooting just 39.5 percent from the floor and 7-for-26 from beyond the arc. The Heat's loss allows several teams to gain ground on them in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Miami is idle Sunday before hosting Phoenix on Monday.

He’s been dealing with an assortment of injuries, limiting him to 34 percent shooting in February. Greivis Vasquez started at point guard, accumulating 14 points, six assists, three rebounds and four three-pointers in 34 minutes. Amir Johnson was thrust back into the starting lineup after coach Dwane Casey decided to go with Patrick Patterson in the previous game.

All three contests between these teams this season have been decided by four points or less. Memphis narrowly avoided its second loss in as many nights and third loss in a row overall. Zach Randolph was held in check offensively, scoring just seven points. The rest of the team had an excellent shooting performance, going 59.4 percent from the field.

												The Utah Jazz (23-35) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (32-27) 82-75 on Saturday at the EnergySolutions Arena. The Jazz entered the fourth quarter with a three-point lead and extended that lead to nine with under four minutes to play. From there, the Jazz never let the Bucks cut the lead to under five points as they secured the victory. It was a sloppy game throughout, as neither team shot over 40 percent and both teams had more than 20 turnovers. The Jazz's victory gives them the season sweep over the Bucks. Milwaukee's four-game Western Conference road trip has gotten off to a rocky start with two straight losses to sub-.500 opponents. Zaza Pachulia got the start at center but managed just two points on 1-of-8 shooting. Four out of the five starters had three turnovers as the Bucks dropped their fourth game in five outings. The next stop on the road trip is in Denver on Tuesday. Utah got a 23-point effort from Trey Burke off the bench as it notched its second straight victory. Rudy Gobert turned in a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double and added three blocks over 32 minutes on the floor. The Jazz will look to extend their win streak to three on Tuesday against the Grizzlies.

James Jones got the starting nod for LeBron James. Jones played 30 minutes but only managed six points and one assist. Kevin Love and J.R. Smith were forced to step up their games without the teams two leading scorers. Love and Smith combined for 38 points, 12 rebounds, and seven assists.

												The Boston Celtics (23-33) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (23-33) 106-98 Friday.Both teams are fighting for the final playoff spot in the East, but they also have competitions from the Pacers, Nets and Pistons. All five teams sit within a game of each other in the standings.Boston took the win Friday by limiting their turnovers while capitalizing on the Hornets' inability to do so. The Celtics scored 21 points off 16 turnovers but gave up only eight points on eight turnovers. Isaiah Thomas lead the Celtics' attack on offense, posting 28 points and seven assists in 31 minutes off the bench. Jonas Jerebko back Thomas' play, putting up his first double-double as a member of the Celtics with 16 points and 10 rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench. All five starters scored in double digits for the Hornets, and Mo Williams put in a game-high 31 points, but their good work shooting the from the field couldn't make up for their inability to protect the ball. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist continued his inspired play of late, posting a second straight double-double and a fourth straight game scoring in double digits. He finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds in 32 minutes.Charlotte owns the season series with Boston, holding a 2-1 lead after Friday's game, and they'll meet on Mar. 30 for a game that could lead to one team making the playoffs and the other team going to the lottery.Boston will take Saturday off before hosting the Golden State Warriors on Sunday, and Charlotte will wrap up their four-game road trip Sunday against the Orlando Magic.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (13-45) defeated the Washington Wizards (33-26) 89-81 on Friday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. With both teams riding their respective five-game losing streak, each were looking to get things turned around with a victory on Friday. In a surprising effort, the Sixers were able to come out victorious and end their drought. While they didn't necessarily have the best game shooting the ball, finishing at 35 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, they still shot better than the Wizards, who finished at just 32 percent from the field and a meager 24 percent from beyond the arc. Leading the way for the Sixers was Nerlens Noel, who went 5-for-9 from the floor and 4-for-6 from the free throw line for a team-high of 14 points, to go along with 13 rebounds, two steals and three blocked shots. He's really started to get it going offensively, averaging 12.2 points per game over his last five. It was also his first double-double since the end of January, so it was good to see that type of production. Robert Covington was a key contributor in the win. In just 26 minutes, he posted 13 points (3-9 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and six rebounds. He's played well following the All-Star break, averaging 13.2 points and 4.8 rebounds over five games. Coming just short of his own double-double, Luc Richard Mbah A Moute recorded 10 points (4-9 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 0-4 FT), eight rebounds and four assists. He combined for just 12 points and eight rebounds over his previous two games, so it was good to seem him have a little more success Friday. The only other Sixer to reach double figures in points was Jason Richards, who finished with 12 points (4-9 FG, 4-7 3Pt) and five assists in 26 minutes. For the Wizards, John Wall did the bulk of the damage despite the loss. He went off for 21 points (7-26 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and 11 assists, notching his third double-double over his last four games. During that four game stretch, he's averaged 13.0 points and 11.0 assists, but made just 1-of-10 from the three-point line over that same span, so it wasn't all good for the guard. Another surprise performance came from Otto Porter, who went 8-for-19 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 19 points as the starter at small forward. It was a new season-high for the forward, as he received extended playing time with Paul Pierce sitting due to a knee injury. It was his second solid showing in a row, as he's combined for 32 points on 14-of-30 shooting from the floor. Coming off the bench, Ramon Sessions added 14 points (4-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and four rebounds in 21 minutes. Considering he's averaging just 5.3 points on the season, it was a nice surprise for the Wizards. Marcin Gortat chipped in with eight points (4-8 FG, 0-2 FT) and 14 rebounds as well. The Sixers' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday, while the Wizards will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Orlando,Magic,State Farm Arena,19,41,46,12,14.0,31.0,36.0,81.0,9.0,12.0,42.0,27.0,18.0,9.0,24.0,35.0,75.0,7.0,13.0,37.0,22.0,17.0,DeMarre Carroll,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,31,Tobias Harris,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,36,Paul Millsap,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,8.0,17.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,34,Channing Frye,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,24,Al Horford,13.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Nikola Vucevic,15.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,10.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,36,Kyle Korver,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,34,Victor Oladipo,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,18.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,35,Jeff Teague,0.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,33,Elfrid Payton,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Pero Antic,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13,Dewayne Dedmon,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Kent Bazemore,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,24,Willie Green,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,27,Dennis Schroder,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,13,Andrew Nicholson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10,Shelvin Mack,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,7,Kyle O'Quinn,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Mike Scott,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,16,Luke Ridnour,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,12

												The Atlanta Hawks (46-12) beat the Orlando Magic (19-41) 95-88 on Friday.Al Horford had a good all-around game, putting up 17 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and two steals in a tough matchup against Nikola Vucevic. Kyle Korver was the lone Atlanta starter not to reach double figures in points. Jeff Teague bounced back from an illness, he scored 17 points to go along with seven assists and two steals. After a rough start to the month, the Hawks have won three straight and sit atop the Eastern Conference with a nine game lead on the second place Toronto Raptors.The Magic lost in devastating fashion to the Miami Heat in overtime Wednesday. They blew a seven point lead with 43 seconds remaining and they might have carried that with them into Friday's contest against the Hawks. Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Aaron Gordon (ankle) and Evan Fournier (hip) were unable to play due to injury. The Magic have four teams between them and the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.The Magic will host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday, and the Hawks with take on the Heat in Miami on Saturday.

												The New York Knicks (11-46) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23-35) 121-115 on Friday at the Palace of Auburn Hills. While currently riding an eight-game losing streak, the Knicks were able to overcome the drought and secured a victory in a double-overtime thriller. With just six seconds left in regulation, Langston Galloway came up clutch for the Knicks and hit a three-point shot to tie the game. Anthony Tolliver had a shot to win it at the buzzer, but instead it went into overtime. In the first overtime, it was the Pistons who came up with the clutch bucket at the end of the period, as Greg Monroe made a layup to even the score with 12 seconds left, eventually pushing it to a second overtime. The Knicks took off in the second overtime though, and finished off the surprising six-point victory on road, which marked just their eleventh total win on the season.The Knicks saw a huge contribution from Andrea Bargnani, who posted a team-high of 25 points (10-20 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-5 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists. He has only played eight games so far this season, and this was far-and-away his most productive showing. The point, rebound and assist numbers were all season-highs, while the double-double was his first of the year as well. Posting a double-double of his own, Lou Amundson was very effective, finishing with 17 points (8-16 FG, 1-1 FT), 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. Despite averaging just 4.2 points per game, he's now posted double figures in points in three straight games, after previously hitting that mark only once so far this year. Tim Hardaway Jr was dialed in with his shot, going 7-for-14 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding four assists. He shot a combined 7-for-24 from the field over his last two games, so it was refreshing to see him find increased succes during Friday's matchup. Coming off the bench, Shane Larkin added 16 points (5-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and three assists.For the Pistons, the frontcourt duo of Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond were a huge reason for their success. Each recorded a double-double, as Monroe posted 28 points (9-13 FG, 10-15 FT), 13 rebounds and two blocked shots, while Drummond finished with 21 points (9-11 FG, 3-7 FT), 15 rebounds and four blocked shots. Drummond has been on an absolute tear of late, posting four double-doubles in a row, while averaging 18.5 points and 15.3 rebounds over that span. He's averaging 12.8 points and 13.0 rebounds on the season. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope gave the frontcourt some help as well and recorded 19 points (7-18 FG, 3-11 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six rebounds. Like Drummond, he's playing at a very high rate, averaging 21.0 points over his last three games. Both Reggie Jackson and Jodie Meeks reached double-digit points as well. Jackson finished with 16 points (5-24 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and five assists, while Meeks notched 16 points (5-8 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and two assists. The Pistons just couldn't limit the Knicks enough to secure a win. The Knicks' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday, while the Pistons will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday. 											",Detroit,Pistons,New York,Knicks,Little Caesars Arena,11,46,23,35,8.0,31.0,39.0,97.0,29.0,40.0,54.0,22.0,15.0,6.0,17.0,44.0,105.0,25.0,26.0,55.0,26.0,10.0,Tayshaun Prince,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Cleanthony Early,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,20,Greg Monroe,13.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,28.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,44,Lou Amundson,14.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,17.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Andre Drummond,15.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,21.0,9.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,40,Andrea Bargnani,12.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,10.0,20.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,36,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,19.0,7.0,18.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,42,Tim Hardaway Jr.,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,31,Reggie Jackson,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,24.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,41,Langston Galloway,6.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,34,Anthony Tolliver,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,24,Lance Thomas,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Caron Butler,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,21,Cole Aldrich,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,John Lucas III,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Jason Smith,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Jodie Meeks,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,32,Shane Larkin,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,35,Shawne Williams,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6,Alexey Shved,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,19

												The Golden State Warriors (45-11) defeated the Toronto Raptors (37-21) 113-89 on Friday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. Already riding a three-game losing streak, it continued to get worse for the Raptors, taking a lopsided 24-point loss to the Warriors. The Warriors got off to a really quick start, out-scoring the Raptors 27-11 after the first quarter and 54-31 by half. Along with the hot start, the Warriors also secured the shooting advantage, going 48 percent from the field and 46 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors ended at 40 percent from the floor and a brutal 18 percent from deep. The Raptors just weren't able to keep up with the high-scoring offense of the Warriors. As has been the case for the majority of the season thus far, the Warriors' superstar backcourt duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson did the bulk of the work offensively. Curry went 8-for-13 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 22 points, while adding six rebounds and five assists as well. He could have had a lot higher numbers at the conclusion, but he only had to play 25 minutes, with such a large lead. He's averaged 24.0 points and 6.3 assists over his last three games. Thompson, on the other hand, posted a team-high of 25 points (9-18 FG, 5-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT), to go along with five assists in 28 minutes. He's been hitting his three-point shot at a very high rate recently, going a combined 9-of-15 from deep over his previous three outings. He's now averaging 22.1 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.9 assists on the season. Draymond Green had a very efficient 17 points (6-9 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), while coming just shy of a double-double with nine rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's had two solid showings in a row, combining for 33 points, 17 rebounds and seven steals. For the Raptors, DeMar DeRozan ended up as the only starter reaching double figures in points. He finished with 14 points (4-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and three rebounds in 26 minutes on the court. It was the third time over his last four games shooting under 35 percent from the field, as he's struggled to get dialed in. With the rest of the starters combining for only 19 points, the Raptors turned to the bench for some offensive help. Terrence Ross was the biggest contributor, going 7-for-14 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to post 18 points in just 24 minutes. After failing to reach double figures in points for seven straight games, Ross finally got rolling and was able to convert on 50 percent (7-14 FG) of his shots. He's averaging 9.9 points and 3.1 rebounds on the season. The only other Raptor to reach double-digit points was Louis Williams, who also came off the bench. In 26 minutes, he finished with 12 points (2-7 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and four rebounds. On a side note, both Tyler Hansbrough and Festus Ezeli were ejected after they got into a shoving match.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Sunday, while the Raptors will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Saturday. 											",Toronto,Raptors,Golden State,Warriors,Scotiabank Arena,45,11,37,21,4.0,22.0,26.0,71.0,23.0,28.0,39.0,13.0,17.0,13.0,27.0,39.0,77.0,14.0,17.0,40.0,29.0,8.0,James Johnson,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,21,Harrison Barnes,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,29,Patrick Patterson,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Draymond Green,9.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,17.0,6.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,27,Jonas Valanciunas,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,27,Andrew Bogut,8.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,18,DeMar DeRozan,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,26,Klay Thompson,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,9.0,18.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,28,Kyle Lowry,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,18,Stephen Curry,6.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,13.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,25,Amir Johnson,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Festus Ezeli,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Lou Williams,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,26,Justin Holiday,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,12,Greivis Vasquez,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,25,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,19,Terrence Ross,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,24,David Lee,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Tyler Hansbrough,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Shaun Livingston,2.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21

												The Chicago Bulls (37-22) beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (13-44) 96-89 on Friday.With Derrick Rose likely to be out for awhile after undergoing surgery on his meniscus, the Bulls will look to Aaron Brooks to help keep them afloat near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Brooks played 31 minutes and scored six points on 2-of-15 shooting. He had four assists, four rebounds and one steal to help make up for his poor shooting performance. Taj Gibson got the start at power forward in place on Pau Gasol, who was out with an illness. Gibson injured his ankle and was unable to return to the game. Jimmy Butler put on a show, he played 43 minutes and had 28 points, 12 rebounds, 2 blocks and 2 steals.   Adreian Payne was placed back into the starting lineup at power forward. He came off the bench Wednesday to allow Kevin Garnett to make his return to the Timberwolves as a starter. Garnett (rest) sat out against the Bulls. Payne played 27 minutes and finished with six points and five rebounds. Ricky Rubio dished out 10 assists to go along with 15 points and six rebounds. Despite playing their best basketball of the season in the month of February, the Timbwolves still own the worst record in the Western Conference.  Minnesota will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday and the Bulls will welcome the Los Angeles Clippers to town on Sunday.

												The Houston Rockets (40-18) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (23-33) 102-98 on Friday at the Toyota Center in Houston. The Nets came out strong in this one, out-scoring the Rockets 36-25 right away in the first quarter. They weren't able to hold the lead though as the Rockets pulled within three points at half and eventually snuck out the four-point win in front of their home crowd. Both teams shot similar percentages, as the Rockets went 46 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets went 45 percent from the floor and 24 percent from deep. The Nets turned the ball over 17 times though, which may have made the difference in this one. Terrence Jones was unstoppable Friday, going 11-for-16 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free throw line to finish with a game-high of 26 points, while also adding 12 rebounds and a blocked shot. In the five games following the All-Star break, he's looked very well rested and has averaged 13.8 points and 10.2 rebounds over that span. It marked his second double-double over his last three games. Trevor Ariza also had a very strong showing, posting 20 points (7-11 FG, 5-9 3Pt, 1-1 FT), five rebounds and two steals. It was his second straight game with 17 points, as he's gone a combined 12-for-21 from the field and 10-for-19 from the three-point line over those two outings. He's now averaging 12.6 points and 5.4 rebounds on the season. With Jones and Ariza providing so much offense, James Harden didn't have to do as much. He still posted 15 points (4-15 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 7-7 FT) though, while also adding five rebounds and 12 assists. His scoring was down, but it marked his third straight double-double, as he's been finding his teams at a very high rate of late. Despite suffering the loss, the Nets had six players reach double figures in points. Mason Plumlee led the way, going 7-for-10 from the field for 15 points, to go along with four rebounds and two blocked shots in 22 minutes. He continues to fight for playing time with Brook Lopez at the center position, who equaled his playing time with 22 minutes off the bench. Lopez has been more effective recently and continued to show well Friday, finishing with 12 points (4-12 FG, 4-4 FT) and 12 rebounds. Over his last four games he's averaged 17.0 points and 10.5 rebounds. Recording 15 points (6-15 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT) of his own, Deron Williams got it going as a member of the starting lineup again. He hasn't shot well recently, combining to go 9-of-28 from the field over his last two games, so we'll see if he can make some adjustments and improve over his next few outings. Both Markel Brown and Joe Johnson also reached double figures in points. Brown contributed 14 points (5-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds, while Johnson had 13 points (5-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT), nine rebounds and six assists as well. The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, while the Nets will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Saturday. 											",Houston,Rockets,Brooklyn,Nets,Toyota Center,23,33,40,18,9.0,32.0,39.0,84.0,15.0,17.0,41.0,26.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,Trevor Ariza,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,36,Alan Anderson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,36,Terrence Jones,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,11.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,36,Joe Johnson,9.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,40,Donatas Motiejunas,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,23,Mason Plumlee,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,James Harden,5.0,12.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,15.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,38,Markel Brown,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,35,Patrick Beverley,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,34,Deron Williams,5.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,34,Josh Smith,9.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,28,Jarrett Jack,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,22,Jason Terry,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,11,Brook Lopez,12.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,22,Corey Brewer,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,16,Thaddeus Young,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16,Pablo Prigioni,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12,Cory Jefferson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Joey Dorsey,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Bojan Bogdanovic,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Los Angeles Clippers (38-21) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (41-16) 97-79 Friday.Los Angeles stopped their two-game skid with the win, and they're still an impressive 5-3 without Blake Griffin, who continues to sit out while recovering from elbow surgery to remove an infection. DeAndre Jordan posted a double-double of 15 points and 22 rebounds in 41 minutes, continuing the dominant play that has seen him pull down at least 15 rebounds for seven straight games. The one game in which he finished with only 15 rebounds, Jordan played just 20 minutes as the Clippers blew out the Kings. Five players scored in double figures for Los Angeles as Chris Paul orchestrated the offense and collected a double-double of 19 points and 13 assists.Memphis has dropped two straight with their offense sputtering in both games. They shot just 38 percent from the field, 25 percent from beyond the arc and 67 percent from the stripe as a team Friday. Jeff Green was an anemic 0-for-6 from the field and played just 16 minutes despite starting at small forward. Since joining the Grizzlies, Green has struggled on offense, shooting 41 percent from the field and 31 percent from three. After losing the first two games of their season series, the Clippers were able to take the win on the road to put them in position to try and tie the series up in their final matchup when the two teams meet on April 11. The Clippers will continue their road trip against the Bulls on Sunday, and the Grizzlies will head out on the road as well to play the Timberwolves on Saturday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (31-27) beat the Miami Heat (25-32) 104-102 on Friday.Alexis Ajinca has put together a nice three-game stretch, averaging 16.7 points, 7.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 23 minutes a game over that span. He recorded 24 points, eight rebounds and three blocks against the Heat. He led all bench players in those three categories. Tyreke Evans has been dealing with a sore left foot but was able to play and start. He recorded 19 points and 11 assists in 33 minutes. Dante Cunningham has been starting at power forward for the Pelicans while Anthony Davis is out with a shoulder injury. Cunningham had a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double performance. New Orleans is now 20-10 at home this season and have won four straight games overall.The Miami Heat beat the Magic in overtime in miraculous fashion on Wednesday. They came back from a seven-point deficit with under a minute remaining to send the game into overtime and handled the Magic in the final five minutes. This time it was the Heat trying to keep their opponent from attaining a comeback victory. They led by nine heading into the fourth quarter, but couldn't hold on as Ajinca and Evans led the Pelicans to victory in the final period. Michael Beasley was signed to a 10-day contract and was made available to play in New Orleans. He played 10 minutes and scored seven points on 3-of-7 shooting from the field.The Heat will host the Eastern Conference leading Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. The Pelicans will head to the Pepsi Center to take on the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.

												The Utah Jazz (22-35) defeated the Denver Nuggets (20-38) 104-82 on Friday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. The Jazz got off to a quick start Friday, out-scoring the Nuggets 28-17 in the first quarter, while eventually taking a 50-34 lead at half. Along with the strong start, the Jazz also shot much better, going 57 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line, while the Nuggets finished at just 33 percent from the floor and a meager 25 percent from deep. Despite turning the ball over 23 times, the Jazz made up for it with a 43-36 rebounding advantage. Leading the way for the Jazz was Derrick Favors, who went 7-for-10 from the field and 7-for-8 from the free throw line to finish with a team-high of 21 points, while adding 10 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. The double-double marked his second over his last three games, a stretch where he's averaged 16.3 points and 9.7 rebounds. Coming off the bench, Trey Burke was a huge factor in the win, scoring 19 points (8-12 FG, 3-4 3Pt), to go along with four assists and four steals in 23 minutes. He continues to be a great source of points off the bench, averaging 16.8 points over last five games. Despite turning the ball over seven times, Gordon Hayward had a solid overall effort. In just 26 minutes, he recorded 15 points (5-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT), five assists and two steals. He now boasts season averages of 19.6 ponts, 4.9 rebounds and 4.2 assists. Also off the bench, Rodney Hood posted an efficient 14 points (5-8 FG, 3-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) in 19 minutes. Continuing his hot streak, Will Barton finished with a game-high of 22 points (8-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), to go along with two assists off the bench in 31 minutes. He's been a fantastic producer for the Nuggets ever since joing them through a trade at the deadline, as he's now averaging 14.5 points and three rebounds in the four games since coming over. He didn't reach double figures once in his time with the Trail Blazers, so it's great to see him have so much success with more of an opportunity. Another strong contribution from the bench came from Kenneth Faried, who posted 12 points (4-9 FG, 4-4 FT) and eight rebounds. He missed Wednesday's game with a thumb injury, so the Nuggets decided to bring him off the bench in his return. The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was Danilo Gallinari. In 25 minutes as a starter, he finished with 13 points (5-15 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and two steals. The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Milwuakee Bucks on Saturday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Utah,Jazz,Pepsi Center,22,35,20,38,8.0,31.0,28.0,82.0,16.0,27.0,35.0,20.0,14.0,8.0,20.0,36.0,63.0,17.0,21.0,41.0,23.0,19.0,Danilo Gallinari,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,25,Gordon Hayward,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,26,Joffrey Lauvergne,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,25,Derrick Favors,10.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,21.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,JJ Hickson,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Rudy Gobert,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,31,Gary Harris,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,16,Joe Ingles,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,21,Ty Lawson,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,31,Dante Exum,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,18,Wilson Chandler,8.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,33,Trey Burke,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,23,Randy Foye,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,16,Elijah Millsap,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,24,Kenneth Faried,8.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Rodney Hood,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,19,Will Barton,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,30,Trevor Booker,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Jameer Nelson,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7,Jeremy Evans,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13

												The San Antonio Spurs (35-23) defeated the Sacramento Kings (20-36) 107-96 on Friday.The Spurs have been struggling as of late, losing their four games previous to Friday's win over the Kings, who were without DeMarcus Cousins due to hip and ankle injuries. Kawhi Leonard played a team-high 36 minutes and finished with 17 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal to lead his team to victory. Tiago Splitter had nine rebounds and three blocks. He was given the start at center, which moved Aron Baynes to the bench. Baynes played 18 minutes and scored eight points.Jason Thompson shifted over to the center position to make room for Carl Landry who got the start in place of Cousins. Landry and Thompson combined for 20 points and 16 rebounds. Second-year player Ben McLemore led Sacramento in points with 21. He hit 10 of his 12 free throw attempts. The Kings are now 13-17 at home this season. San Antonio will travel to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Saturday, and the Kings will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (16-41) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (32-26) 101-93 on Friday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Lakers looked as if they were on their way to a loss following the third quarter, when they were down 72-65. They woke up in the fourth quarter though, and went on to out-score the Bucks 36-21, therefore pushing them to an eight-point win in front of their home crowd. The Lakers were the superior shooters in this one, going 47 percent from the field and 33 percent from three-point line, while the Bucks finished at 39 percent from the floor and just 24 percent from beyond the arc. The Lakers had a true team-effort win Friday, with six players reaching double figures in points. Rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson led the way, going 7-for-9 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also adding five assists. It was the second impressive performance in a row for the rookie, as he's combined for 38 points and eight rebounds over his last two. Wayne Ellington was also a big factor in the victory, posting 14 points (6-13 FG, 2-6 3Pt), six rebounds and five assists. He pushed his averages to 9.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game on the season. The Lakers also saw some decent contributions from their bench. Jeremy Lin recorded 14 points (4-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and six assists, while Jordan Hill had 14 points (6-18 FG, 2-2 FT) and seven rebounds. The Bucks saw the bulk of their production from Ersan Ilyasova, who went off for 17 points (5-10 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and 12 rebounds in just 28 minutes. After going six straight games with less than 10 points, he's returned to form and has gone three straight in double figures. He's averaging 9.1 points and four rebounds on the season. Giannis Antetokounmpo also did his best to keep the Bucks in the game. In 36 minutes, he recorded 13 points (4-12 FG, 5-8 FT), eight rebounds and four assists, despite struggling with his shot. It was his third straight game shooting under 35 percent, as he's gone a combined 8-of-28 from the field over that stretch. Coming off the bench, Jerryd Bayless added 12 points (5-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and three assists in 32 minutes. Recently acquired Michael Carter-Williams chipped in with eight points (3-6 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four assists in just his second game with the Bucks.  The Lakers' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, while the Bucks will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Saturday. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Milwaukee,Bucks,Staples Center,32,26,16,41,,,,,,,,,,4.0,17.0,34.0,87.0,21.0,29.0,49.0,18.0,11.0,Ryan Kelly,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,24,Giannis Antetokounmpo,8.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,36,Carlos Boozer,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,21,Ersan Ilyasova,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,28,Robert Sacre,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Zaza Pachulia,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Wayne Ellington,6.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,36,Khris Middleton,8.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,32,Jordan Clarkson,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,30,Michael Carter-Williams,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,26,Jeremy Lin,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,29,Jerryd Bayless,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,32,Ed Davis,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Jared Dudley,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23,Jordan Hill,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,John Henson,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Wesley Johnson,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,27,Tyler Ennis,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,12,Tarik Black,,,,,,,,,,,,Miles Plumlee,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

												The Portland Trail Blazers (38-19) beat the Oklahoma City Thunder (32-27) 115-112 on Friday.In a game of amazing performances, the Trail Blazers were led by LaMarcus Aldridge with 29 points, 16 rebounds, five assists one steal and one block. He got into a small spat with Serge Ibaka late in the fourth quarter and a double-technical was handed out. Damian Lillard had 29 points of his own on 10-of-22 shooting. Newly acquired guard Arron Afflalo came off the bench and scored 18 points. Portland outscored the Thunder by 14 in the fourth to win a tough game that came down to the wire and may go down as one of the most entertaining games of the season. The Blazers own the fourth best record in the Western Conference. Russell Westbrook became the first player since LeBron James to record three triple-doubles in a row. Westbrook had one of the best performances by any player this season. He finished with 40 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists. In February he is averaging an Oscar Robertson-esque 30.4 points, 10.2 assists and 8.7 rebounds a game. Mitch McGary came off the bench and put up 20 points and nine rebounds in 28 minutes. The Thunder were without Enes Kanter (thigh). Nick Collison started in his place and played 12 minutes and scored six points with three rebounds. After a rough start to the season, Oklahoma City is currently in the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference standings. The Thunder will head to Los Angeles to face the Lakers on Sunday, as the Trail Blazers will travel to Sacramento for a matchup with the Kings.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (37-22) defeated the Golden State Warriors (44-11) 110-99Cleveland's answer to Golden State's Splash Brothers was a dominant performance from LeBron James. James had a remarkable game with a season-high 42 points on 15-of-25 shooting from the field to go with 11 rebounds and five assists. When the first quarter ended, both teams were on pace to top 120 points on the night. From there, Cleveland pulled away and never let Golden State get too close. Whenever the Warriors seemed poised to make a run, the Cavaliers had an answer. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 31 points on just 10-of-30 from the floor. Golden State has now dropped two of its last three games against Eastern Conference opponents. Shooting was a major issue throughout this game, as Golden State couldn't seem to get into an offensive rhythm, especially in the second half. The Warriors entered the game shooting just under 48 percent from the field as a team, but were held to 42.4 percent on Thursday and 37 percent from beyond the arc. Golden State draws another tough Eastern Conference opponent Friday with a matchup against Toronto. The Cavaliers rode James' dominant performance to their 11th straight at home. Cleveland has now won 18 of their last 20 games overall. Center Timofey Mozgov pitched in a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds in 25 minutes of action. The Cavaliers have a meeting in Indiana with the Pacers on Friday, the team that snapped their 12-game winning streak earlier this month.

												The Phoenix Suns (31-28) held on to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder (32-26) 117-113 in overtime Thursday at the US Airways Center. With the Sun setting on Phoenix's playoff hopes, the Suns picked up a huge victory over one of the NBA's hottest teams. Oklahoma City absorbed Phoenix's early haymakers and responded with some big runs of their own. When Markieff Morris converted a three-point play to put the Suns up three with time winding down, Russell Westbrook responded with a three-point play of his own to help force the second overtime game between these teams this season. Russell Westbrook had his second straight triple-double with 39 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists, but the rest of the Thunder were unable to produce in the overtime period. These two teams will meet again on March 29 in Phoenix.Oklahoma City Westbrook continued to make his case for MVP with an incredible outing, but the Thunder fell short. Outside of Westbrook's incredible outing, the Thunder struggled to score the basketball. Westbrook's 39 points were more than the other four starters combined. Oklahoma City travels to Portland on Friday for the second half of a back-to-back set. Phoenix has responded after a rough start to the post All-Star push with two victories in two nights. Eric Bledsoe was up to the challenge Thursday, just missing out on a triple-double of his own as he lit up the Thunder for 28 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists. The Suns get another chance to gain ground in the West on Saturday when they host the Spurs.

												The Miami Heat (25-31) defeated the Orlando Magic (19-40) 93-90 in overtime Wednesday.Luol Deng has stepped up his point production since the team lost Chris Bosh for the remainder of the season due to blood clots in his lung. Over his last two games, Deng has averaged 25.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists. Hassan Whiteside continued his breakout season with 15 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks. Dwyane Wade went 6-for-19 but had a huge assist on Henry Walker's three-pointer that sent the game into overtime, overcoming an eight-point deficit with 42 seconds remaining in regulation.It looked like the Magic had wrapped up their fourth straight victory until they gave up a Walker three-pointer with less than three seconds to go, forcing the game into an extra session. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic in points with 26 and scored all five Orlando points in overtime, but it wasn't enough to stop Wade and the Heat from stealing a victory at the Amway Center. Victor Oladipo didn't have a great shooting night, going 4-for-13 from the field for 13 points. However, he led Orlando in rebounding with 13 to go along with four assists in 42 minutes. Aaron Gordon left Wednesday's game with an ankle sprain and didn't return after recording six points in nine minutes of action in the first half.Miami will travel to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on Friday. The Magic will face the Eastern Conference-leading Atlanta Hawks from Phillips Arena on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (45-12) beat the Dallas Mavericks (39-21) 104-87 on Wednesday.Dennis Schroder had a nice game off the bench, leading the Hawks with 17 points. All five starters also scored in double figures for the Hawks. Jeff Teague has been battling an illness, but he was able to start against Dallas and finished with 11 points in 26 minutes. There was a brief delay during the first quarter, as the roof at Phillips Arena was leaking water onto the court. The issue was resolved and the game continued, as Atlanta battled back from an 11-point deficit after the delay.The Mavericks were without point guard Rajon Rondo after he was given a one-game suspension for a verbal altercation with coach Rick Carlisle during Tuesday's contest. The spat apparently continued in the locker room, and Rondo was forced to sit out Wednesday for conduct detrimental to the team. J.J. Barea was given the nod to start the game in place of Rondo, finishing with 13 points, seven assists and five rebounds in 30 minutes. Monta Ellis led Dallas in scoring with 19 points, but Dirk Nowitzk had his worst scoring outing of the season, recording just four points in 25 minutes of action.Dallas will host the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, and the Hawks will host the Orlando Magic on Friday.

												The Boston Celtics (22-33) defeated the New York Knicks (10-46) 115-94 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston.While they were down 49-48 at half, the Celtics took off in the second half, out-scoring the Knicks 67-45 to finish the game. The Celtics used their superior shooting to to gain an advantage, as they went 51 percent from the field and 45 percent from the three-point line, while the Knicks finished at just 42 percent from the floor and a meager 10 percent from deep. The Celtics also out-rebounded the Knicks 46-41, only helping to further their lead.The Celtics saw a huge contribution from their bench, including their three leading scorers. Isaiah Thomas was one of those players, as he finished with 19 points (3-10 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 11-11 FT), six rebounds and seven assists in 27 minutes. He's played extremely well for Boston, averaging 20.3 points and 5.3 assists in the three games since coming over from Phoenix. Jae Crowder was another one of those bench contributors, posting 18 points (7-12 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and six rebounds in 28 minutes. He's really started to come on for the Celtics, combining to score 52 points, while grabbing 20 rebounds over his last three games. The third strong performance from the bench was to recently acquired Jonas Jerebko. In just 20 minutes, he went 7-for-10 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 20 points. It marked a new season-high for the forward, as it was far-and-away his most productive performance on the season. Marcus Smart had a strong showing with the starters as well, posting 16 points (6-9 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four assists.The Knicks were led by Andrea Bargnani, who came off the Knicks' bench to score 17 points (5-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 7-9 FT), while also adding six rebounds and two blocked shots in 25 minutes. Playing in just his seventh game of the season due to injury, it was easily his strongest showing to this point. The Knicks also received a nice effort from Jason Smith, who finished with 14 points (5-9 FG, 4-6 FT) and 10 rebounds. It marked just his third double-double of the season. Scoring 14 points (6-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT) of his own, Langston Galloway continued to stay one of the Knicks more consistent players of late. Over his last three games he's averaging 15.3 points, the best stretch of any other Knicks' player. Lou Amundson added an efficient 14 points as well, going 6-for-8 from the field and 2-for-2 from the free throw line.The Celtics' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday, while the Knicks will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Friday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (23-32) defeated the Chicago Bulls (36-22) 98-86 on Wednesday at the United Center in Chicago.After losing Derrick Rose to a meniscus tear in his right knee that will likely cost him the rest of the season, it didn't get much better for the Bulls, as they suffered a 12-point loss in front of their home crowd Wednesday. They were down just two points coming out of the third quarter, but the Hornets took off in the fourth, out-scoring the Bulls 31-21 to finish the game. Coming into this outing riding a five-game losing streak, it was good to see the Hornets get things turned around and grab a win against a quality Chicago team, as they really had to get things turned around with the playoffs still in their sights.  For the Hornets, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was on fire, going 7-for-12 from the field and 4-for-6 from the free throw line to score 18 points, while also adding 12 rebounds as well. Despite averaging just 10.6 points per game on the season, he's really started to turn it on for the Hornets, averaging 16.7 points and 7.3 rebounds over his last three games. Mo Williams played a big factor in the win as well. In 26 minutes, he posted 17 points (7-15 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five assists. In the three games he's played with the Hornets since coming over from the Timberwolves at the trade deadline, he's averaged an impressive 20.3 points and 6.7 assists, as he's been a great addition on the offensive side of the ball. Al Jefferson had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (7-17 FG, 2-4 FT) and seven rebounds. It was the first time over his last four games that he didn't reach double-digit rebounds, but it didn't matter, as the Hornets still pulled off the win. Coming off the bench, Brian Roberts chipped in with an efficient 12 points (5-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt) as well.Pau Gasol continued with his dominant season for the Bulls, going 11-for-20 from the field too score a game-high of 25 points, while also adding 13 rebounds and four blocked shots. It marked his third double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 18.7 points and 11.7 rebounds per game. He's also had at least one block in each of his last five games. Jimmy Butler did his best to help Gasol out, posting 14 points (5-11 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-5 FT), seven rebounds and five assists. After going off for 30 points in the Bulls' first game following the All-Star break, he's slowed down a little bit, scoring below his season average in three straight games. He's now averaging 20.3 points and 5.9 rebounds on the year. Without Rose, Aaron Brooks got the start at point guard. He didn't have the best night shooting the ball, but still finished with 12 points (4-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-8 FT), to go along with four assists. Tony Snell, who just posted 20 points on Monday, added 10 points (4-8 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and three rebounds off the bench.The Hornets' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Friday, while the Bulls will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Houston Rockets (39-18) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (37-21) 110-105 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston.After winning two straight coming into this game, the Rockets were able to continue with their momentum and pull off the tight win over the Clippers, who haven't been playing their best basketball of late. Coming out of the third quarter, the Rockets trailed 85-84, but they had a great effort both offensively and defensively in the fourth, out-scoring the Clippers 26-20 to finish the game. The Rockets were able to force the Clippers into 16 turnovers, while committing only 10 of their own, which may have made the difference in this one.While he didn't have the monster line we've come accustomed to, James Harden still finished with 21 points (4-13 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 10-12 FT) and 10 assists as the leader of this team. It marked his second double-double in a row, combining for 52 points, 15 rebounds and 20 assists over those two games. Donatas Motiejunas got dialed in with his shot, going 7-for-11 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while adding nine rebounds. Motiejunas had hit just two three-pointers over his last eight games, so it was good to see him finally start hitting some shots. It marked his best offensive performance since the end of January. Trevor Ariza made his fair share of buckets as well, posting 17 points (6-11 FG, 5-9 3Pt) in 34 minutes. Along with Motiejunas, Ariza was a big help in spreading the floor to open up the lane for Harden Wednesday. Coming off the bench, Corey Brewer finished with a team-high of 20 points (7-17 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-5 FT), to go along with six rebounds. He's now posted 20 points or more in three out of his last five games, as he's starting to heat up.Despite the loss, the Clippers saw three players break the 20-point mark. Coming off the bench, Jamaal Crawford led the charge, going 10-for-17 from the field and 3-for-7 from the three-point line to score 24 points in 33 minutes. Crawford has been absolutely unstoppable in the month of February, as he's now recorded 20 or more points in seven of his last eight games. Over that eight game stretch he's averaging 21.4 points. DeAndre Jordan was an absolute animal as well. In 37 minutes, he finished with 22 points (9-12 FG, 4-8 FT), 19 rebounds and two blocked shots, as the Rockets' frontcourt just couldn't matchup with him. Over his last six games he's averaged 19.0 points and 19.3 rebounds, posing as one of the most consistent players for the Clippers recently. Chris Paul was the final player reaching the 20-point mark, as he finished with 22 points (8-18 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 14 assists. It was his sixth double-double in his last seven games, pushing his season averages to 17.9 points and 9.8 assists.The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while the Clippers will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Friday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (32-25) beat the Philadelphia 76ers (12-45) 104-88 on Wednesday.Michael Carter-Williams made his Bucks debut against the team that sent him away at the trade deadline last Thursday. He started and finished with seven points, eight assists and two steals in 18 minutes. He had been bothered by a toe injury and hadn't played since Feb. 3. Jerryd Bayless moved back to a bench role with the availability of Carter-Williams, but the former still scored 13 points in 30 minutes. John Henson had his best performance of the season Wednesday. He came off the bench and led Milwaukee in scoring with 21 points to go along with nine rebounds, three blocks, two assists and two steals in 29 minutes. On the injury front, shooting guard O.J. Mayo did not play due to a sore right hamstring.Playing in just his third game of the season, Jason Richardson (knee) started at shooting guard and led the Sixers in scoring with 16 points in 25 minutes. Thomas Robinson, who was acquired of waivers this week, played 13 minutes and finished with seven points and six rebounds. However, Philadelphia has lost five straight games and haven't beat a team that is currently over .500 since defeating the New Orleans Pelicans on Jan. 16.The 76ers will host the Washington Wizards, who are also winless since the All-Star break, on Friday. Meanwhile, the Bucks will begin a four-game West Coast road trip Friday against the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (13-43) beat the Washington Wizards (33-25) 97-77 on Wednesday.The Timberwolves are enjoying their best month of the season, with a record of 5-4 in February. Kevin Martin has been one of the keys to their recent success.  Martin is averaging 23.8 points over his last five games, giving Minnesota a go-to scoring option alongside 2014 first-overall selection Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins, who put up 19 points on 6-of-13 shooting, is now averaging 15.9 points and 5.3 rebounds in February. Kevin Garnett made his return to the Timberwolves on Wednesday. Starting at power forward, he had five points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes. Gary Neal entered the game unlikely to play with an ankle injury, but he was able to give it a go, finishing with seven points and four rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench.Washington is having a rough go as of late. Their last victory occurred before the All-Star break, and they're losing by an average of 20.5 points per game over the last four contests. Overall, they've dropped five straight and are just 2-8 in February. Only three Wizards scored in double figures, with Otto Porter leading the way with 13 points. John Wall was held to just five points on 2-of-10 shooting for a Washington team that is desperately missing shooting guard Bradley Beal (leg). They added another injury to the ledger when Kris Humphries hurt his hamstring in the first half and was unable to return. He finished with four points in 12 minutes.The Wizards will travel to Philadelphia to take on the 76ers on Friday, while the Timberwolves head to Chicago to take on the Derrick Rose-less Bulls. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Washington,Wizards,Target Center,33,25,13,43,4.0,13.0,35.0,81.0,23.0,28.0,53.0,17.0,16.0,4.0,17.0,32.0,83.0,7.0,8.0,38.0,20.0,19.0,Andrew Wiggins,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,19.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,35,Otto Porter Jr.,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,29,Kevin Garnett,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Nene,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,24,Nikola Pekovic,13.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Marcin Gortat,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Kevin Martin,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,15.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,30,Garrett Temple,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,25,Ricky Rubio,7.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,30,John Wall,3.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,34,Adreian Payne,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,17,Kris Humphries,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Gary Neal,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,27,Rasual Butler,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,18,Gorgui Dieng,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Ramon Sessions,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Zach LaVine,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,17,Kevin Seraphin,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Lorenzo Brown,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Martell Webster,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,15

												The New Orleans Pelicans (30-27) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (23-32) 102-96 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.Despite finishing with just a six-point victory, the Pelicans were much better with their shooting percentages. They went 51 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets went 42 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep. What really kept the Nets in this game was their ability to force the Pelicans into turnovers, as the Pelicans had 20 turnovers compared to just 12 from the Nets. This was a big win for the Pelicans, as they continue to trail the Thunder for the final projected playoff spot in the Western Conference standings.Seemingly coming out of nowhere, Quincy Pondexter was a huge reason the Pelicans were able to grab a win, despite missing both Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson. He went 9-for-13 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to finish with a game-high of 25 points, to go along with five rebounds. It was a new season-high for Pondexter in just his fourth start of the year, as it was his first time breaking the 20-point mark. Tyreke Evans also had a strong showing, posting 15 points (5-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT), 11 assists and two blocked shots. It was his third double-double over his last four games, a stretch where he's averaged 13.8 points and 9.8 assists. As long as Davis is out, Evans should continue to be the go-to player on offense. Notching a double-double of his own, Omer Asik recorded 12 points (5-6 FG, 2-2 FT) and 13 rebounds. He's combined for 26 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games. Both Norris Cole and Alexis Ajinca reached double figures in points off the bench, with 11 and 10 points respectively.The Nets saw their most production from Joe Johnson, who went 9-for-17 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while adding 10 rebounds as well. He's played well of late, averaging 18.7 points and eight rebounds over his last three games. A big reason for the Nets keeping this game close was their bench though, who combined to score 49 of the teams 96 points. Thaddeus Young was one of those players, as he went off for 19 points (8-12 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and five rebounds. Over his last two outings with the Nets, he's combined for 34 points and 10 rebounds, as he looks to be getting more and more comfortable with his new team. Brook Lopez and Jarrett Jack were the other two bench contributors. Lopez had 15 points (7-14 FG, 1-1 FT), seven rebounds and four blocked shots, while Jack posted 15 points (5-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three assists.The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday, while the Nets will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Friday.

												The Phoenix Suns (30-28) defeated the Denver Nuggets (20-37) 110-96 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.The Suns got off to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Nuggets 35-26 right away in the first quarter. They were the superior shooters as well, going 43 percent from the field, while the Nuggets finished at just 38 percent from the floor. Along with the hot start, the Suns out-rebounded the Nuggets 65-40, giving them a hefty advantage, while also going a long way in making up for the 21 turnovers they committed.The Suns' backcourt duo of Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe were just too much for the Nuggets. Knight finished with a team-high of 19 points (7-16 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six assists, while Bledsoe posted 18 points (7-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT), six rebounds and six assists. While he was having a career year with the Bucks, Knight has continued his strong play since being traded to the Suns, averaging 17.3 points and five assists in the three games since his debut. Bledsoe has also been producing in bunches lately, combining for 39 points and six assists over his last two games. The Suns received a nice contribution off the bench from Gerald Green. In just 21 minutes, he went 5-for-12 from the field and 3-for-9 from the three-point line to score 15 points, while adding four rebounds and three assists as well. With the departure of Isaiah Thomas, Green has now become the best option for the Suns off the bench. Reaching double figures in points for just the second time in his career, rookie T.J. Warren had 10 points (5-8 FG, 0-2 FT) and seven rebounds in 19 minutes.Danilo Gallinari has yet to slow down, as he again posted some impressive numbers for the Nuggets. He went 6-for-16 from the field and 5-for-11 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding seven rebounds as well. Despite averaging 8.8 points on the season, he's averaged 19.3 points over his last three games, while he's shot 45 percent or higher from the three-point line in each of those outings. Coming off the bench, Will Barton is another player who continues to play surprisingly well. In 34 minutes, he posted a team-high of 22 points (6-9 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 7-8 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and three assists. In the three games he's played with the Nuggets since coming over from the Trail Blazers, he's averaged 15.0 points and five rebounds. He failed to get very much playing time with his old team, so he's thriving in his new role. Jeoffrey Lauvergne played in just his third career NBA game Wednesday. The rookie played quite well, going 4-for-7 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 11 points, while grabbing nine rebounds. It was a new season-high in points for him. Ty Lawson posted 13 points (5-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and seven assists.The Suns' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (15-41) beat the Utah Jazz (21-35) 100-97 on Wednesday.The Lakers rattled off a 31-19 fourth quarter after finding themselves down nine at the end of the third. Jordan Clarkson led the scoring attack, starting at point guard and putting up 22 points in 34 minutes, as he filled in for Ronnie Price, who had surgery earlier Wednesday to remove bone spurs and chips in his right elbow. Wayne Ellington dropped a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double on the Jazz. He and Clarkson were the only Lakers to play more than 30 minutes, yet none of the eight players that saw the floor logged less than 20 minutes. Los Angeles has now won two straight after going 0-7 to start the month of February.Utah had won four of their last five games until coughing up a close one to the Lakers. Gordon Hayward nearly banked in a miraculous three-pointer at the buzzer that would've sent the game into overtime. While he finished with 20 points, he also had six turnovers. Rudy Gobert turned in another nice performance with 16 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks. Off the bench, Elijah Millsap led all reserves with 17 points to go along with seven rebounds in 30 minutes.The Jazz will head to Denver to face the Nuggets on Friday, as the Lakers travel home to host the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.

												The Sacramento Kings (20-35) took down the Memphis Grizzlies (41-15) 102-90 on Wednesday.Rudy Gay had a game-high 28 points to go along with six assists and five rebounds. DeMarcus Cousins battled with Marc Gasol and ended up fouling out after 24 minutes. Before his exit, Cousins finished with 16 points, nine rebounds, six assists and one block. The Kings are 2-1 since the All-Star break after getting off to a 1-5 start in the month of February. However, the Kings remain 11 games back of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who hold the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.Similiar to Cousins, Gasol also showed off his passing skills Wednesday. He too had six assists from the center position to go along with 14 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. Zach Randolph was the high scorer for the Grizzlies, with 20 points, five rebounds and four turnovers in 30 minutes. Memphis lost the rebounding battle 47-38, and that proved to be costly. They had a one-point lead going into the fourth quarter but couldn't hold on, as the Kings outscored them 26-13 in the final period.The Grizzlies will host their rival the Los Angeles Clippers, while the Kings will welcome the struggling San Antonio Spurs to town Friday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (37-19) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (34-23) 111-95 on Wednesday at the Moda Center in Portland.The Trail Blazers came out firing in this one, out-scoring the Spurs 32-16 right away in the first quarter. After the Spurs came all the way back to within one point going into halftime, the Trail Blazers took over in the second, out-scoring the Spurs 60-45 to finish the game. The Trail Blazers went 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Spurs went just 44 percent from the field and 38 percent from deep. This loss marked the Spurs fourth in a row.For the Trail Blazers, Wesley Matthews was dialed in, going 11-for-18 from the field and 4-for-10 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 31 points, while also adding five rebounds and three steals. After missing all of his shots (0-7 FG, 0-4 3Pt) during Sunday's game against the Grizzlies, it was a night and day difference for the guard. Damian Lillard also did his part in the win, finishing with 18 points (7-15 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT), seven rebounds and five assists. His scoring has dipped lately, scoring under his average in four straight games, but it didn't matter Wednesday, as the Blazers still secured the win. Nicolas Batum was also firing on all cylinders. He scored 15 points (6-8 FG, 3-5 3Pt), to go along with nine assists and two steals. He's been on a roll over his last two games, shooting a combined 13-for-21 from the field and 6-for-12 from deep to score 32 points. LaMarcus Aldridge added a double-double with 11 points (5-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 13 rebounds.The Spurs got most of their production from both Danny Green and Tim Duncan. Green finished with 17 points (4-9 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and five rebounds, marking his first time in double figures over his last four games. Duncan, on the other hand, went 9-for-12 from the field to post a team-high of 20 points, while also adding eight rebounds. He's combined for 34 points and 18 rebounds over his last two games. Kawhi Leonard didn't shoot the best, but still recorded 14 points (5-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT), eight rebounds and four steals. He's now averaging 14.8 points and 7.4 rebounds on the season. Tony Parker really struggled to get it going as well, shooting just 1-of-8 from the field for two points.The Trail Blazers' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday, while the Spurs will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings on Friday. 											",Portland,Trail Blazers,San Antonio,Spurs,Moda Center,34,23,37,19,13.0,26.0,43.0,84.0,12.0,15.0,44.0,25.0,13.0,6.0,17.0,32.0,74.0,13.0,13.0,35.0,18.0,13.0,Nicolas Batum,4.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,36,Kawhi Leonard,8.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,35,LaMarcus Aldridge,13.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,19.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,34,Tim Duncan,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Robin Lopez,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Aron Baynes,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Wesley Matthews,5.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,31.0,11.0,18.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,33,Danny Green,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,32,Damian Lillard,7.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,15.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,33,Tony Parker,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,26,Arron Afflalo,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,25,Manu Ginobili,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,12,Chris Kaman,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Boris Diaw,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,20,Steve Blake,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Marco Belinelli,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21,Meyers Leonard,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,10,Tiago Splitter,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Allen Crabbe,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Cory Joseph,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11

												The Golden State Warriors (44-10) defeated the Washington Wizards (33-24) 114-107 on Tuesday at the Verizon Center in Washington.The Wizards couldn't get it done against one of the best of the Western Conference, marking their fourth loss in as many games. They actually shot better from the field, going 53 percent from the field, compared to 50 percent from the Warriors, but they were killed from the three-point line, as the Warriors finished at 52 percent, while the Wizards went a meager 28 percent. What really made the difference though was the turnovers, as the Wizards were forced into 26, while the Warriors ended with just nine. After missing the last game with a foot injury, Stephen Curry made a welcomed return, finishing with a game-high of 32 points (11-18 FG, 5-9 3Pt, 5-5 FT), to go along with eight assists and two steals. It seems safe to say the injury didn't bother him much in this one. Despite missing a game, he's had a very strong stretch over his last three, averaging 27.3 points, nine assists and three steals. Fellow backcourt superstar, Klay Thompson also did his part. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to finish with 17 points, while also adding four assists and five steals. He was coming off a 39-point performance on Sunday, but didn't have to do as much this time around with Curry back on the court. Thompson is now averaging 22.4 points and 2.9 assists on the season. The Warriors received a nice contribution from their bench. In just 15 minutes, Marreese Speights was very effective, scoring 16 points (6-12 FG, 4-6 FT) and grabbing two rebounds. After two straight games playing less than 10 minutes, he made a statement with the extra playing time he received. Draymond Green pitched in with 13 points (5-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt), six rebounds and five assists as well. Paul Pierce did everything he could to shoot the Wizards out of their slump. He went 7-for-11 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 25 points, while grabbing five rebounds as well. He had shot 40 percent or less in four out of his last five games, so it was good to see him get dialed back in and have a nice showing. John Wall also played well, recording 16 points (8-18 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and 11 assists. He did have eight turnovers though, so it wasn't all good for the point guard. The double-double marked his second in a row, as he's combined for 26 points and 23 assists over his last two matchups. Notching a double-double of his own, Marcin Gortat had a very efficient 16 points (8-11 FG), to go along with 11 rebounds and a block. After posting 24 points and 10 rebounds Sunday, he's clearly on a roll and has picked his game up of late. Kevin Seraphin had the most production off the bench, as he posted 10 points (5-9 FG) and three rebounds in 18 minutes. It was only the second time in the last 10 games that he reached double-digit points, so the Wizards need him to continue improving to gain some more depth off the bench.  The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, while the Wizards will travel to Minnesota to play the Timberwolves on Wednesday. 											",Washington,Wizards,Golden State,Warriors,Capital One Arena,44,10,33,24,5.0,18.0,42.0,79.0,18.0,21.0,45.0,23.0,26.0,12.0,23.0,45.0,90.0,12.0,17.0,29.0,27.0,9.0,Paul Pierce,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,28,Harrison Barnes,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,Nene,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,27,Draymond Green,6.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,29,Marcin Gortat,11.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Andrew Bogut,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Garrett Temple,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,31,Klay Thompson,1.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,34,John Wall,3.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,4.0,8.0,34,Stephen Curry,0.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,32.0,11.0,18.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,33,Kevin Seraphin,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,18,David Lee,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Rasual Butler,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,21,Marreese Speights,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,15,Ramon Sessions,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,15,Andre Iguodala,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,29,Martell Webster,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Leandro Barbosa,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13,Kris Humphries,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Shaun Livingston,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (36-22) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23-34) 102-93 on Tuesday at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The Pistons led by nine at the half, but the Cavaliers doubled them up in the third quarter 24-12 to take the advantage. Detroit was stuck on 78 points for just five minutes in the fourth quarter as Cleveland began to salt the game away. These two teams will wrap up their season series on April 13th in Cleveland.Cleveland had its first truly competitive game since the All-Star break, but still managed to win by nine points. LeBron James had another strong outing with 19 points, 11 assists, and seven rebounds, but also had nine turnovers. Iman Shumpert played significant minutes, but managed just eight points on 2-of-10 shooting from the field. Kendrick Perkins saw his first minutes as a Cavalier on Tuesday, although he was only on the floor for two minutes. The Cavaliers have a marquee matchup Thursday when they play host to the Warriors. Detroit lost for the first time since the break after beating Chicago and Washington in its return to action. Reggie Jackson continued his excellent play as a Piston with 22 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. Tayshaun Prince made his Pistons return Tuesday and contributed seven points, four rebounds, and two steals over 31 minutes. Detroit will return to the floor Friday when it plays host to New York. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Cleveland,Cavaliers,Little Caesars Arena,36,22,23,34,9.0,24.0,33.0,82.0,18.0,30.0,46.0,16.0,13.0,14.0,37.0,34.0,77.0,20.0,24.0,40.0,22.0,14.0,Tayshaun Prince,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,LeBron James,7.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,19.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,9.0,39,Greg Monroe,14.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,33,Kevin Love,9.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,16.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,34,Andre Drummond,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Timofey Mozgov,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,14.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,32,JR Smith,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,21,Reggie Jackson,8.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,35,Kyrie Irving,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,34,Anthony Tolliver,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,28,Iman Shumpert,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,10.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,30,Caron Butler,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,Tristan Thompson,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Jodie Meeks,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15,James Jones,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,15,Spencer Dinwiddie,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,9,Matthew Dellavedova,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,16,John Lucas III,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3,Kendrick Perkins,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (32-25) defeated the Indiana Pacers (23-34) 105-92 on Tuesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. The Thunder got off to a quick start, out-scoring the Pacers 30-20 right away in the first quarter. While they weren't able to pull away in the second, they took off again after halftime, out-scoring them 57-50 over the course of the second half. While they both shot nearly identical percentages from the field and three-point line, the Thunder took advantage at the free throw line, converting on 16-of-18 from the line, while the Pacers made just 7-of-11. The Thunder also secured a 57-48 rebounding advantage. Russell Westbrook was again an absolute animal in this game. He was able to notch a triple-double before the fourth quarter even started. In just 28 minutes of time, he finished with 20 points (8-19 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT), 11 rebounds and 10 assists, and he could've put up some even higher numbers if the Thunder weren't up by so much during the fourth. Serge Ibaka had himself a game as well, posting 23 points (9-11 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT), 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. He's really turned it on over his last four games, posting three double-doubles during that span. Over that four game stretch, he's averaged 20.0 points, 13.0 rebounds and 3.5 blocks. Recently aquired from the Jazz, Enes Kanter continued his strong play with the Thunder, finishing with 15 points (6-10 FG, 3-4 FT) and five rebounds in just 23 minutes. With the Thunder so far, he's averaged 15.0 points and 10.0 rebounds over three games. The Thunder also saw a couple of strong contributions from the bench, with both Dion Waiters and Anthony Morrow finishing in double figures. Waiters had 14 points (5-18 FG, 4-9 3Pt) and two rebounds, while Morrow totaled 12 points (5-9 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and five rebounds. The Pacers had four starters finish in double figures, but weren't able to slow down the Thunder offense. C.J. Miles did the most damage, going 9-for-14 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to finish with a team-high of 21 points. He's really stepped it up following the All-Star break, averaging 17.0 points and 4.7 rebounds over his last three games. Coming just shy of a double-double, George Hill recorded 13 points (5-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), eight assists and three steals. He had gone a combined 5-for-7 from the three-point line in the two previous games coming into Tuesday, but he couldn't stay hot and really struggled with his shot in this one. After posting back-to-back 30-point games, Rodney Stuckey came back down to earth and finished with just five points (2-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and five assists. It's nothing new for Stuckey, as he's been very inconsistent with his scoring all season long. Solomon Hill (4-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and David West (5-13 FG, 1-2 FT) each added 11 points apiece.  The Thunder's next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Thursday, while the Pacers will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (39-20) defeated the Toronto Raptors (37-19) 99-92 Tuesday at the American Airlines Center.Dallas' Rajon Rondo took the ball up the floor with the Mavericks losing by nine early in the third quarter. Coach Rick Carlisle took a timeout and Rondo never got back on the floor after the two appeared to have a heated exchange. After Rondo's exit, the Mavericks outscored 46-30 to close out the Raptors and notch their 39th win of the season. The reason behind Rondo and Carlisle's spat was unclear, but the Mavericks will hope that those tensions are resolved sooner rather than later.   Toronto mustered just 15 points in the fourth quarter as its losing streak extended to three games. DeMar DeRozan led the team in scoring with 18 points and Greivis Vasquez had a quality game off the bench with 14 points on 5-of-6 shooting from the field. The Raptors have another tough test ahead of them with a matchup against Golden State scheduled for Friday. Dallas got key performances in the second half from Devin Harris and J.J Barea, who split the minutes at point guard in Rondo's absence. They combined for 27 points, eight assists, and four rebounds over 47 total minutes in the game. The Mavericks shot 48 percent from the field as a team on their way to their third straight game. Tyson Chandler was shaken up towards the end of the game, but it didn't appear to be serious. The Mavericks will play the second half of a back-to-back Wednesday against the Hawks.

												The Miami Heat (24-31) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (12-44) 119-108 on Monday.The Heat are still reeling from the recent news that Chris Bosh will miss the remainder of the season with blood clots in his lung. Udonis Haslem started Monday at power forward in place of Bosh, playing 23 minutes with four points and seven rebounds. Luol Deng lit up the 76ers for 29 points on 11-of-14 shooting, which was his best scoring performance since dropping 30 on the Dallas Mavericks back on Nov. 9. Newly acquired point guard Goran Dragic had his first double-double in a Heat jersey, with 23 points and 10 assists. He's averaging 17.5 points and 5.5 assists in 33.0 minutes in two games since coming over in a deadline deal with the Phoenix Suns. Mario Chalmers, who was sent to the bench in favor of Dragic, posted nine points and six assists in 21 minutes.Hollis Thompson led all reserves with 22 points on the backs of 6-for-9 from beyond the arc. It was Thompson's second-highest scoring output of the season. Nerlens Noel also had his second-biggest outing of the season in terms of points, scoring 18 to go along with seven boards and four blocked shots. JaVale McGee, who came over in a trade from the Nuggets last week, is averaging just 3.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 12.0 minutes in three contests since he was acquired.

												The Chicago Bulls (36-21) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (31-25) 87-71 on Monday at the United Center in Chicago. In this low scoring game, both teams really struggled to get much going offensively. The Bulls went 36 percent from the field and 31 percent from the three-point line, while the Bucks went just 34 percent from the floor and a meager 22 percent from deep. Despite the poor performance from the field, the Bulls did get off to a solid start though, out-scoring the Bucks 48-33 in the first half. The Bulls committed a brutal 19 turnovers, but by getting out to such a big lead, they gave themselves enough wiggle room to still pull out the victory in front of their home crowd. It also didn't hurt that they finished with a 62-41 rebounding advantage. Leading the starters in scoring, Pau Gasol continued his strong season, finishing with 15 points (5-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-8 FT) and 10 rebounds in 29 minutes. It was his second double-double in a row, a stretch where he's combined for 37 points and 24 rebounds. He's now pushed his season averages to 18.4 points and 12.1 rebounds per game. The Bulls also saw a strong push from their bench, with both Tony Snell and Nikola Mirotic reaching double figures in points. Snell was very efficient from the floor, going 7-for-11 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 20 points in 31 minutes. Mirotic, on the other hand, notched a double-double of his own, finishing with 16 points (4-11 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 6-8 FT), 14 rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a career-high in rebounds for Mirotic, as he was a big reason for the Bulls' advantage on the boards. Joakim Noah was also a force on the boards, grabbing 16 rebounds to go along with eight points (3-9 FG, 2-2 FT).Considering they scored only 71 points, it's not surprising the Bucks had only three players reach double figures in scoring. Khris Middleton led the way, going 8-for-19 from the floor to score 17 points, while also adding six rebounds and three steals. He continues to be very consistent, as he's averaged 16.8 points and 5.6 rebounds over his last five games. Ersan Ilyasova was also productive, as he moved into the starting lineup. In 35 minutes, he finished with 15 points (6-16 FG, 3-8 3Pt) and 11 rebounds. It was a new season-high in rebounds for him, as well as his best scoring output since the end of November. The only other Buck reaching double-digits in points was Giannis Antetokounmpo, who recorded 11 points, despite shooting just 3-for-10 from the field. He was coming off an impressive 19-point showing on Sunday, so it was somewhat of a let-down performance.  The Bulls' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, while the Bucks will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets (38-18) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (12-43) 113-102 on Monday at the Toyota Center in Houston. The Rockets shot well in this game, going 42 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves went 33 percent from the floor and just 28 percent from beyond the arc. While the game was tied 56-56 at half, the Rockets went off in the third quarter, out-scoring the Timberwolves 28-19, which eventually set them up to secure the win in front of their home crowd. Exploding for his second triple-double of the year, James Harden showed again why he's one of the best players in the league. He shot 7-for-20 from the field and 5-for-11 from the three-point line to finish with a game-high of 31 points, while adding 11 rebounds, 10 assists and four blocked shots. Coming out of the All-Star break he's looked very well rested, averaging 25.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 7.3 assists over his last three games. He did receive plenty of help though, starting with Terrence Jones, who posted 15 points (6-9 FG, 3-5 FT) and 15 rebounds in 32 minutes. It was one of his most productive games of the short season he's had, including a new season-high in rebounds. He's also now had at least two blocks in each of his last three games. Coming off the bench, Josh Smith had a strong performance, posting 17 points (7-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 1-1 FT), four rebounds and three steals before fouling out. He's now scored 15 or more points in five of his last six games, despite averaging 12.4 points per game on the season. Trevor Ariza added 10 points (4-11 FG, 2-8 3Pt), eight rebounds and four steals as well. The Timberwolves were able to keep it close, having all five starters reach double figures in points. They just didn't have enough of a bench presence though, as their bench was out-scored 36-10 by the Rockets. Doing everything he could to keep the Timberwolves in the game, Andrew Wiggins finished with 30 points (12-24 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and six rebounds. He's gone a combined 21-of-39 from the field to score 50 points over his last two games since returning from the All-Star break, as his confidence is through the roof. Kevin Martin had a solid showing as well. He recorded 21 points (5-18 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 8-8 FT) and two assists, but did turn the ball over six times. He has scored 20 or more points in each of his last five games, pushing his average to 20.7 points per game on the season. Ricky Rubio nearly had a triple-double, scoring 14 points (2-9 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 10-10 FT), to go along with nine rebounds, seven assists and four steals, while Nikola Pekovic posted a double-double of his own with 16 points (6-18 FG, 4-4 FT) and 13 rebounds. The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. 											",Houston,Rockets,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Toyota Center,12,43,38,18,12.0,38.0,39.0,94.0,23.0,34.0,56.0,23.0,16.0,5.0,18.0,31.0,93.0,35.0,39.0,58.0,17.0,20.0,Trevor Ariza,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,36,Andrew Wiggins,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,12.0,24.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,41,Terrence Jones,15.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Adreian Payne,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,29,Donatas Motiejunas,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,30,Nikola Pekovic,13.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,34,James Harden,11.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,31.0,7.0,20.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,38,Kevin Martin,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,5.0,18.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,39,Jason Terry,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,28,Ricky Rubio,9.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,14.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,38,Corey Brewer,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,22,Gorgui Dieng,14.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Josh Smith,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,15.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,26,Chase Budinger,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Pablo Prigioni,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,19,Zach LaVine,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,14,Joey Dorsey,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Glenn Robinson III,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,KJ McDaniels,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Lorenzo Brown,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

												The New Orleans Pelicans (29-27) beat the Toronto Raptors (37-19) 100-97 on Monday.The Pelicans learned Sunday that they will be without superstar forward Anthony Davis for a week or two, while he deals with a nagging shoulder injury. On Monday, Dante Cunningham got the start at power forward in place of Davis. Cunningham played 31 minutes, recording five points and six rebounds. New Orleans got big performances off the bench from Luke Babbitt and Alexis Ajinca. They combined for 34 points on 14-of-20 shooting from the floor and 17 rebounds. Recent addition Norris Cole had 15 points and six assists off the bench as well. Tyreke Evans put up his third double-double over his last five games, during which he's averaging 13.2 points, 8.8 assists and 4.6 rebounds.The Raptors have dropped two straight to follow up a four-game win streak and are now 4-4 in the month of February. Jonas Valanciunas put up 17 points and 14 rebounds in Monday's loss. Toronto was led in scoring by All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry with 22 points to go along with three steals. Louis Williams also played 25 minutes Monday, as he's been bothered by an ankle injury and missed the Raptors previous game Saturday against the Rockets, a 98-76 loss. Toronto still holds the second-best overall record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors will head to Dallas to face the Mavericks on Tuesday. The Pelicans will host the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (23-31) defeated the Denver Nuggets (20-36) 110-82 on Monday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.The Nets dominated this game, finishing with the scoring advantage in every single quarter of play. Their shooting percentage was a big reason for that, as they went 47 percent from the field, while the Nuggets finished at just 33 percent. The Nets also out-rebounded the Nuggets 57-49, even furthering their advantage and helping them secure an impressive 28-point victory on the road.It was a total team-effort for the Nets on Monday, as they had seven of their ten players reach double figures in points. At point guard, Deron Williams did the most for the starters, finishing with 16 points (6-15 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 12 assists in 33 minutes. After struggling for a long stretch of the season, it looks as if he may have figured things out during the All-Star break, as he's posted two double-doubles in a row, a stretch where he's combined for 28 points and 27 assists. Rookie Markel Brown was in the starting lineup and had the best game of his career. He set career-highs in both points and rebounds, finishing with 10 and 11 respectively. The Nets also saw a huge effort from their bench, with both Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young doing their part. Lopez posted 19 points (6-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and nine rebounds, while Young had 15 points (6-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five rebounds. Lopez has put in a couple of strong games in a row, combining for 41 points and 33 rebounds over the last two. While most of the Nuggets struggled to get anything going, it was Danilo Gallinari who got hot Monday. He went 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 22 points. It was his first game shooting over 50 percent from the field since the end of January, so we'll see if he can keep it up moving forward. Coming off the bench, Will Barton had himself a game, recording 15 points (5-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four rebounds in just 21 minutes. In the two games since coming over from the Trail Blazers, he's now set a new season-high in points during both outings, as he's getting a lot more run on the court with the Nuggets than he was with his previous team. With Wilson Chandler sitting out, Darrell Arthur moved into the starting lineup and posted 10 points (5-15 FG) and seven rebounds. It was only his second start of the year, so it was good to see him have some success. Rookie Gary Harris was the only other Nugget in double figures, as he finished with 10 points (4-12 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 1-3 FT) of his own.     The Nets' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.  											",Denver,Nuggets,Brooklyn,Nets,Pepsi Center,23,31,20,36,6.0,23.0,30.0,85.0,13.0,22.0,47.0,17.0,11.0,4.0,21.0,43.0,92.0,20.0,23.0,57.0,21.0,10.0,Danilo Gallinari,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,30,Joe Johnson,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,28,Darrell Arthur,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Alan Anderson,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,28,Jusuf Nurkic,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Mason Plumlee,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16,Gary Harris,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,26,Markel Brown,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,45,Ty Lawson,5.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,31,Deron Williams,5.0,12.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,33,Joffrey Lauvergne,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,20,Brook Lopez,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Kenneth Faried,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Sergey Karasev,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Randy Foye,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,20,Thaddeus Young,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,23,Will Barton,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,21,Darius Morris,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,14,JJ Hickson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,Cory Jefferson,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

												The Boston Celtics (21-33) took down the Phoenix Suns (29-28) 115-110 on Monday.Avery Bradley has been the go-to man for the Celtics since the All-Star break, averaging 23.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 4.3 steals in that span. He led both teams in scoring Monday, putting up 23 points to go along with six steals in 29 minutes. Isaiah Thomas faced off against the team that dealt him away at the trade deadline last week. He had a plus-21 off the bench, recording 21 points and seven assists in 27 minutes. Boston will be without big man Jared Sullinger for the remainder of the season due to a stress fracture in his foot. In his place, Tyler Zeller got the start at center Monday, posting 12 points and six rebounds in a team-high 36 minutes.Former Bucks guard Brandon Knight got the start for his new team Monday. In his first contest with the Suns, he came off the bench and had 13 points and five assists in 25 minutes against the Chicago Bulls, a 112-107 loss on Saturday. Knight started alongside Eric Bledsoe, who approached a triple-double with 21 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. Alex Len continued his maturation process with 10 points, 12 boards and six blocked shots. The Suns are sitting on the 10th-best record in the Western Conference, and are chasing the New Orleans Pelicans and Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth and final playoff spot.The Suns will head to Denver to face the Nuggets on Wednesday, while the Celtics will host the New York Knicks on Wednesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (41-14) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (37-20) 90-87 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. In a very evenly matched game, it was the Grizzlies who pulled out the close victory, as they took down a team that they could see again when the playoffs come around. Both teams had similar shooting percentages, with the Grizzlies going 41 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Clippers went 44 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep as well. The Clippers did turn the ball over 14 times, compared to only 10 turnovers from the Grizzlies, so those few extra mistakes may have cost them in this one.  The Clippers got most of their production from Chris Paul on Monday. He went 13-for-22 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 30 points, while also adding 10 assists and two blocked shots. It was the fifth double-double over his last six games, a stretch where he's averaged 19.5 points and 12.2 assists. The only other Clipper to reach double figures in points was Jamal Crawford, who came off the bench for 15 points (4-15 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds in 26 minutes. He had scored 20 or more points in six straight games leading up to this one, but he couldn't keep the streak alive. It was still a solid line for the guard, who now owns a season average of 16.3 points per game. DeAndre Jordan went a perfect 4-for-4 from the field to score nine points, to go along with 17 rebounds and two blocked shots. He continues to be an absolute animal on the boards, grabbing 15 or more rebounds in each of his last five games. The Clippers put themselves in position to grab a win, but just couldn't get it done in the end. For the Grizzlies, Mike Conley had a solid showing. He posted 18 points (5-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 7-8 FT), seven assists and two steals in 34 minutes. He's had a nice impact on the defensive side of the ball lately as well, recording two or more steals in four out of his last five games. Jeff Green shot the ball well in this one. He went 5-for-12 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while adding six rebounds. He's now averaging 15.8 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists on the season. Marc Gasol reached double figures as well, posting 14 points (6-11 FG, 2-2 FT), to go along with six rebounds and three blocked shots. It was his second straight game with three blocks. While he didn't have the best game offensively as he scored just seven points (2-12 FG, 3-6 FT), Zach Randolph made up for it by grabbing 10 rebounds. It was only the second time over his last 20 games he failed to reach double-digit points, but his teammates picked up the slack and the Grizzlies still came out with the win. Coming off the bench, Tony Allen chipped in with 10 points (4-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-4 FT), five rebounds and two steals in 28 minutes. The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, while the Clippers will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Wednesday. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,Memphis,Grizzlies,Staples Center,41,14,37,20,,,,,,,,,,5.0,15.0,33.0,81.0,19.0,26.0,42.0,22.0,10.0,Matt Barnes,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,35,Jeff Green,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,34,Spencer Hawes,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,32,Zach Randolph,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,31,DeAndre Jordan,17.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,40,Marc Gasol,6.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,30,JJ Redick,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,37,Courtney Lee,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,29,Chris Paul,4.0,10.0,2.0,2.0,30.0,13.0,22.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,39,Mike Conley,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,33,Jamal Crawford,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,15.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,26,Tony Allen,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,28,Austin Rivers,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,11,Kosta Koufos,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Glen Davis,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Beno Udrih,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7,Hedo Turkoglu,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Nick Calathes,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Blake Griffin,,,,,,,,,,,,Jon Leuer,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (35-22) defeated the New York Knicks (10-45) 101-83 on Sunday.After losing their first matchup of the season on Opening Night, the Cavaliers took home wins in the final two games of their season series, as the Cavs and Knicks won't play each other again the rest of this season. Cleveland has won two straight games coming out of the All-Star break. Sunday's win was the result of a team effort, as four players finished in double digits, but no player scored more than 18 points. They're heading into a tough stretch of games that will see the Cavs play nine of their next 12 games on the road, but they'll have some extra help guarding the paint, as the Cavs are expected to have the recently-signed Kendrick Perkins available for Tuesday's game in Detroit.New York has dropped their first two games coming out of the All-Star break, and they've lost 11 straight reaching back to Feb. 3. Since Carmelo Anthony (knee) announced he'd sit out the rest of the season, Cleanthony Early and Lance Thomas have been the first players to earn spot starts at small forward for the Knicks, and as with all things for the Knicks this season, the results have been less than exciting. While six players scored in double digits for the Knicks on Sunday, the team-high was an underwhelming 13 points scored from Langston Galloway.

												The Atlanta Hawks (44-12) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (31-24) 97-86 on Sunday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.The Hawks came out firing in this game and built an early lead, out-scoring the Bucks 48-35 in the first half alone. The Bucks made a run in the third to bring themselves within two, but the Hawks took off in the fourth quarter and finished with an 11-point victory on the road. With the win, the Hawks ended the Bucks' four game winstreak, while also getting back in the winning column after losing their last two in a row. It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings.The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10-21FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks' frontcourt just didn't have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday's matchup. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4-11 FG, 4-9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4-8 FG, 2-2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 16.8 points on the season, so he's still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3-10 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes.Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7-for-15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3-13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he didn't grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6-12 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 16.8 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6-for-11 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals. It was his second straight start with Michael Carter-Williams still injured, as he's combined for 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists over that span, while posing as the replacement point guard in the starting lineup. As soon as Carter-Williams is healthy, it should push Bayless back to the bench.The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Monday.

												The Detroit Pistons (23-33) defeated the Washington Wizards (33-23) 106-89 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.While the Pistons trailed 52-47 at halftime, they turned it up in the second half, out-scoring the Wizards 59-37 to finish the game, therefore securing the win in front of their home crowd. The Pistons used their three-point shooting to take an advantage in this one, going 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Wizards went just 35 percent. The Pistons also finished with a 51-43 rebounding advantage, giving them an added boost in the victory.Kentavious Caldwell-Pope did most of the damage for the Pistons, going 10-for-20 from the field and 6-for-13 from the three-point line to finish with 26 points. He's starting to heat back up and has scored 20 or more points in two of his last three games. Reggie Jackson had a successful outing in his highly anticipated debut with the Pistons. Starting at point guard, he recorded 17 points (7-18 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), five rebounds and five assists in 30 minutes. This may only be the start for Jackson, as he should get even better as he becomes more accustomed to and comfortable with his new teammates. The Pistons' frontcourt was just as successful though, with both Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond posting double-doubles. Drummond recorded 18 points (8-11 FG, 2-4 FT) and 16 rebounds, while Monroe finished with 15 points (6-16 FG, 3-6 FT), 15 rebounds and three steals. Drummond has come out of the All-Star break in impressive fashion, combining for 36 points and 36 rebounds in the first two games back.Most of the Wizards' success came from center Marcin Gortat, who went 12-for-18 from the field to score a team-high of 24 points, while also grabbing 10 rebounds. The 24 points matched a season-high for him, but it wasn't enough to push the Wizards to a win. John Wall didn't have the best game offensively, as he posted only 10 points (5-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt), but he did hand out 12 assists, so it wasn't all bad for the guard. Without Bradley Beal (leg) in the lineup, the Wizards really struggled to get anything going on the offensive side of the ball. Starting in place of Beal at shooting guard, Garrett Temple had 12 points (4-7 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four rebounds in 30 minutes. It was the first time he's reached double figures in points since the beginning of November, so the added minutes really helped him get things going. The only other Wizard to reach double-digit points was Kris Humphries, who came off the bench for 11 points (5-6 FG, 1-2 FT) and seven rebounds.The Pistons' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday, while the Wizards will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday.

												The Indiana Pacers (23-33) defeated the Golden State Warriors (43-10) 106-98 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.Despite being down 38-26 after the first quarter, the Pacers made a statement in the second, out-scoring the Warriors 34-19 to finish the half. After taking the lead in the second, they were able to hold on throughout the rest of the game and secure the win over an extremely tough opponent in front of their home crowd. The Pacers were the superior shooters in this one, going 48 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Warriors went just 38 percent from the floor and 35 percent from deep.The Pacers' saw a huge contribution from their bench Sunday, with 63 of their 106 points coming off the bench. Rodney Stuckey led that charge, going 11-for-17 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 30 points, while also adding five assists. He's come out of the All-Star break on fire, recording two 30-point games in a row, as he's been a huge reason for the Pacers recent success. C.J. Watson was another one of those bench players who got hot and finished with 14 points (4-6 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and five assists in 26 minutes. He had failed to reach double figures in three straight games prior to Sunday, so it was good to see him get back on track. For the starters, George Hill and C.J. Miles were the only relatively effective players. Miles posted 13 points (5-11 FG, 3-6 3Pt) and nine rebounds, including a clutch three-pointer to put the Pacers up four points with less than a minute left in the game, while Hill added 12 points (4-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and a pair of assists. The Pacers' guards did all the work in this one, and it paid off with a win.Quite uncharacteristicly, the Warriors struggled to get going, with only two players reaching double-digits in points. With Stephen Curry sitting out, Klay Thompson did far-and-away the most damage for the Warriors, finishing with a game-high of 39 points, as he went 12-for-28 from the field and 5-for-13 from the three-point line. He also was able to get to the free throw line 10 times, converting on a perfect 10-of-10. He's played well since returning from the All-Star break, combining for 59 points over his last two games. Andre Iguodala was the only other significant offensive contributor, posting 14 points (4-11 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four assists in 32 minutes off the bench. It was his second straight game with 14 points, despite averaging only 7.3 points per game on the season. Also off the bench, David Lee chipped in with six points and 12 rebounds.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday, while the Pacers will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Tuesday.

												The Orlando Magic (19-39) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (12-43) 103-98 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando.The Magic got off to a quick start in this game and took an early lead, finishing the first half up 55-47. Despite shooting better from the field, the Magic didn't have as much success from the three-point line, where they went a meager 26 percent compared to the Sixers, who went 38 percent. Making up for their poor three-point shooting, the Magic did it on the defensive side of the ball and forced the Sixers into 21 turnovers, while committing just 15 of their own, which may have ultimately been the difference in this game.Nikola Vucevic had his way with the Sixers' bigs. He went 14-of-24 from the field to score a game-high of 31 points, while also adding 14 rebounds in 37 minutes. He's been extremely consistent all season and it continues to show, as he's posted three double-doubles in a row, a stretch where he's averaging  25.7 points and 15.0 rebounds per game. He's now averaging 19.6 points and 11.3 rebounds on the season. Victor Oladipo was another player with a solid showing. He didn't have his best shooting performance on the season (4-11 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-9 FT), but he still finished with 17 points, as he was able to get to the free throw line at a high rate. In the two games since returning from the All-Star break, he's combined for 39 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Rookie Elfrid Payton nearly notched a triple-double, as he recorded 10 points (3-7 FG, 4-8 FT), eight rebounds and seven assists. He's been filling up the stat sheet lately, combining for 20 points, 15 rebounds and 18 assists over his last two games. Willie Green had a big game off the bench with 16 points (6-10 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 31 minutes.Robert Covington had the most success for the Sixers, going 6-for-13 from the field and 3-for-9 from the three-point line to finish with 16 points, while also adding nine rebounds and two steals before fouling out. He had a very poor showing in Friday's game against the Pacers, shooting just 20 percent (2-10 FG), so it was good to see him get things turned back around. Coming off the bench, Jakarr Sampson had a very efficient showing. In just 21 minutes, he posted 16 points (6-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), marking a new season-high in points. He's scored in double figures for three straight games now, after only doing it five times previously in the season. In his Sixers debut, Isaiah Canaan moved into the starting lineup at point guard and had 14 points (5-12 FG, 4-9 3Pt), four rebounds and three assists. He should only continue to get better with the huge increase in minutes, as he didn't get much playing time with the Rockets.The Magic's next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday, while the Sixers will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Monday.

Adding to the strong start, the Thunder shot very well in this game, going 52 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three-point line, while the Nuggets finished at 36 percent from the field and a meager 26 percent from deep. To go along with their superior shooting, the Thunder also had a strong showing on the glass, securing a 60-42 rebounding advantage.The Thunder had three players reach the 20-point plateau. As he's been doing all season long, the Russell Westbrook show continued, as he went 8-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to finish with a team-high of 21 points, while adding eight rebounds and 17 assists in just 27 minutes. He was extremely effective, and could've had some even bigger numbers, if he wasn't pulled due to a huge lead. Coming out of the All-Star break, he's picked up right where he left off, recording three double-doubles in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 29.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 12.3 assists per game. Newly aquired center Enes Kanter played very well in his second game as a member of the Thunder. He posted 20 points (8-12 FG, 4-6 FT) and 12 rebounds, notching his second double-double in as many games with the Thunder. He's combined for 30 points and 25 rebounds during that span. Nearing a triple-double of his own, Serge Ibaka finished with 20 points (10-18 FG, 0-1 3Pt), eight rebounds and eight blocked shots in just 26 minutes. Just like Westbrook, he was extremely effective in a limited amount of minutes. Dion Waiters chipped in with 17 points (7-15 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) off the bench.The Nuggets struggled to get their offense going, with only three players reaching double figures in points. After sitting out of Friday's game against the Bucks for an undisclosed reason, Ty Lawson moved back into the starting lineup and led the team with 17 points (6-12 FG, 0-2 3PT, 5-5 FT), four assists and three steals in just 23 minutes. This was his first game since February tenth, so it was good to see there wasn't much rust despite the lengthy absence. Starting at shooting guard, Danilo Gallinari also did as much as he could to keep the Nuggets alive. He went 5-for-11 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to post 16 points in 19 minutes. He shot a brutal 25 percent (3-12 FG) from the field in Friday's game against the Bucks, so it was good to seem him have better success with his shot this time around. The only other player in double figures was rookie center Jusuf Nurkic. He recorded 10 points (5-13 FG) and seven rebounds, but couldn't do it defensively and wasn't able to slow down the Thunder's bigs.The Thunder's next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (38-20) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (22-32) 92-81 on Sunday. With the win, the Mavericks swept the season series against the Hornets 2-0. Dallas has played three games already since the All-Star break ended, losing Thursday's game to the Thunder before taking home wins on Friday and Sunday. Chandler Parsons sat out with a sprained ankle and bone bruise against the Hornets and is expected to miss at least two more games. Richard Jefferson started in Parsons' place, putting up 10 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists in 33 minutes. The Mavs welcomed Amar'e Stoudemire to the team, and he put up 14 points and three rebounds in just 11 minutes off the bench in his debut.Charlotte has dropped five straight games going back to Feb. 7, but they still sit just a half game out of the final playoff spot in the East. Kemba Walker should be out another three to four weeks recovering from knee surgery, but the team traded for Mo Williams last week, and Williams made his debut Saturday, stepping right into the starting lineup at point guard. To follow up his double-double of 24 points and 12 assists from Saturday, Williams put up 22 points and three assists Sunday. He played 38 minutes in each game, showing that the Hornets plan to use him as much as possible until Walker returns.The Mavericks will stay home to host the Raptors on Tuesday, and the Hornets will have off until Wednesday when they continue their road trip in Chicago.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (40-14) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (36-19) 98-92 on Sunday.The Trail Blazers were without LaMarcus Aldridge (sprained thumb), putting them at a disadvantage from the outset. Meyers Leonard stepped into the starting lineup in Aldridge's place and did his best to replace the 23.4 points Portland needed to make up without Aldridge. Leonard scored 11 points in 17 minutes. He has been encouraged to use his face-up game this season, and it's resulted in Leonard extending his range beyond the three-point line, where he converted three of his five attempts from Sunday, a number which may have been higher had he not collected five fouls to limit his time on the court. The newly-acquired Arron Afflalo made his debut with the Blazers, playing 24 minutes off the bench and putting up eight points and four rebounds.Memphis had all five starters finish with double-digit points to help them collect the win in their first game back from the All-Star break. Marc Gasol was questionable for the game with an illness but was able to play through it to score a team-high 21 points in 36 minutes. Portland remains 4.5 games back from Memphis in the Western Conference standings. The Grizzlies are in second place, and the Blazers sit in fourth place, with Houston resting between them in third, one game ahead of Portland.Memphis will continue their road trip in Los Angeles on Monday, and Portland will look to stop their two-game skid at home Wednesday against the Spurs.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (14-41) defeated the Boston Celtics (20-33) 118-111 in overtime on Sunday. Los Angeles took the win to tie the season series with Boston 1-1. The win also helped end the Lakers' seven-game losing streak that stretched back to Feb. 1. Jeremy Lin was the catalyst Sunday, finishing with a team-high 25 points in 30 minutes off the bench. Four bench players finished with double-digit points, as coach Byron Scott turned to his reserves to lead the way.  The Celtics have dropped two straight, but they did enjoy a nice debut performance from Isaiah Thomas. He finished with 21 points in 25 minutes off the bench before getting ejected for arguing an offensive foul call made against him with five minutes left in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder lead the rally back in the fourth to push the game to overtime, but it was Avery Bradley who hit a three-pointer as time expired to send the game into the extra period.Lin was a part of every scoring play in overtime, dishing out three assists in the additional five minutes and scoring four points.Los Angeles will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Wednesday, and the Celtics will wrap up their road trip in Phoenix on Monday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (30-25) continued to roll Saturday, defeating the Charlotte Hornets (22-31) by a score of 110-103With Kevin Durant sidelined with soreness in his foot, Russell Westbrook once again was tasked with carrying the load for the Thunder. Westbrook notched his 14th double-double of the season by putting up 31 points (12-27 FG) and 10 assists. The game was tied at 94 with just under six minutes remaining, but Oklahoma City pulled away in the end.Oklahoma City had several players make their Thunder debuts Saturday, including Enes Kanter, Kyle Singler, and D.J Augustin. Kanter, who was acquired at the trade deadline, finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds over 32 minutes in his first appearance as a member of the Thunder. Augustin saw 23 minutes of playing time and contributed 13 points, three rebounds, and two assists. Oklahoma City could be getting Durant back for Sunday's matchup with Denver. Charlotte's Mo Williams played his first game in a Hornets uniform Saturday after being acquired prior to the All-Star break. Williams got the start at point guard and had a team-high 24 points to go with 12 assists.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (28-27) defeated the Miami Heat (22-31), 105-91. Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson exited the game due to injury and never returned. Davis aggravated a shoulder issue that held him out prior to the All-Star break and will undergo an MRI on Sunday. Ryan Anderson suffered a right knee sprain.After losing his starting spot to Quincy Pondexter, Dante Cunningham started the second half in Anthony Davis’ absence. Norris Cole made his Pelicans debut against the team who traded him, finishing with 12 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal in 30 minutes. Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans each registered six assists, and Gordon added 24 points and six three-pointers in the win.On the day the Heat learned Chris Bosh’s season would end due to blood clots in his lungs, Goran Dragic underwhelmed in his debut. Backup Mario Chalmers outperformed Dragic, leading to a promotion in the second half, replacing Udonis Haslem in the starting lineup. Dragic provided 12 points, three rebounds, one assist, one steal, and one three-pointer in 33 minutes while Chalmers tallied a team-high 20 points in 37 minutes. Hassan Whiteside grabbed 16 rebounds and blocked five shots while Dwyane Wade recorded a team-high four assists and 19 points in 30 minutes.The Heat host the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday and the Pelicans begin a three-game homestand Monday against the Toronto Raptors.

												The Chicago Bulls (35-21) defeated the Phoenix Suns (29-27) 112-107 Saturday at the United Center. Phoenix has now dropped its first two games since dealing the Dragic brothers and Isaiah Thomas at the trade deadline. Brandon Knight made his Suns debut Saturday, putting up 13 points and five assists in 25 minutes off the bench. The Bulls were down by two entering the fourth, but Taj Gibson's 10-point fourth quarter helped them gain the final advantage. Phoenix's Eric Bledsoe cut Chicago's lead to two with under a minute left, but Pau Gasol's running hook shot on the next possession helped give the Bulls the decisive advantage. Phoenix's losing streak has extended to four games after Saturday and it has dropped seven of its last eight. The recent slide has sent the Suns tumbling in the standings and they would not be in the top eight in the West if the season were to end today. Marcus Morris had a strong outing off the bench with 17 points on 8-of-15 shooting. The Suns will look to snap their losing streak Monday against the Celtics. Chicago bounced back from Friday's 100-91 loss to Detroit to notch its 35th win of the season. The Bulls actually outperformed the Suns from three-point range, burying 12 of their 24 attempts from beyond the arc. Kirk Hinrich missed the contest after coming down with an illness. The Bulls will return to action Monday against the Bucks in what could be a playoff series preview.

												The Toronto Raptors (37-18) were unable to sustain the momentum from Friday's win over the Hawks as they were soundly defeated by the Houston Rockets (37-18) Saturday by a final score of 98-76. It was a surprisingly low scoring contest for two of the top scoring teams in the league through three quarters as the Rockets led the Raptors 68-53 heading into the fourth. Houston held Toronto to a paltry 32.5 percent shooting percentage from the field as it cruised to an easy victory. Toronto came into Saturday's contest on the heels of a 105-80 thrashing of the Hawks in Atlanta on Friday, but came out flat. The Raptors were missing Lou Williams for this game as he was sidelined with a sprained left ankle. Toronto now holds a 2.5 game lead over Chicago for the second seed in the East. The Raptors will return to the floor Monday to take on the Pelicans. Houston shook off a 111-100 loss to Dallas on Friday to notch its 37th win of the season thanks in part to a big game from Corey Brewer. On a night where just two Rockets starters scored in double-figures, Brewer poured in a team-high 26 points in 35 minutes off the bench. Recently acquired K.J McDaniels and Pablo Prigioni made their Rockets debuts in this game, each going scoreless in four minutes of playing time. The Rockets are idle Sunday before hosting the Timberwolves on Monday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (37-19) throttled the Sacramento Kings (19-35) 126-99 on Saturday at the Staples Center.The Clippers nearly reached 100 points by the end of the third quarter as they took a commanding 97-65 lead into the fourth. Los Angeles shot just under 48 percent from the floor while the Sacramento was held to just 34 percent (30-88 FGM-A). Austin Rivers led all scorers with 28 points, which is a new career-high for the young guard. The Clippers have now won four in a row in Blake Griffin's absence.George Karl's second game as the Kings' head coach didn't go as smoothly as his debut as his team was outscored 42-18 in the second quarter after leading 29-24 at the end of the first. Ray McCallum made another start at point guard with Darren Collison sidelined with a hip injury and Ramon Sessions' departure. He finished with x and y. DeMarcus Cousins had 21 points, but was only 6-for-19 from the floor and managed just four rebounds over 25 minutes on the floor. The Kings will look to rebound from this defeat Wednesday against the Grizzlies.Los Angeles exploded for 73 points in the second and third quarters to win its second game against Sacramento this season. The Clippers connected on 14 of their 35 attempts from beyond the arc. In addition to Rivers' big night, the Clippers got big performances from Jamal Crawford and J.J Redick, who scored 23 and 24 points respectively. The Clippers will go for their fifth-straight win Monday against the Grizzlies.

												The Orlando Magic (18-39) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (27-27) 95-84 on Friday.The Magic got a nice performance from Evan Fournier, who was placed into the starting lineup for Tobias Harris, who missed his third-straight game with a knee injury. Fournier finished with a plus-19 plus/minus to go along with 16 points, six rebounds and three assists. Elfrid Payton began the post All-Star break on a good note. He posted a double-double, finishing with 10 points on four-of-seven shooting, 11 assists and seven rebounds. The Magic have now won three out of their last five games. Orlando will take on the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.New Orleans dropped back down to .500 after their less-than-stellar performance in their loss to Orlando.

												The Miami Heat (23-30) defeated the New York Knicks (10-44) 111-87 on Friday.Goran Dragic was acquired from the Suns in a deadline deal on Thursday.

Shabazz Napier also had a nice game. The rookie had 18 points, six assists and seven rebounds, but he did turn the ball over seven times.

Miami banded together and eight of their nine players scored at least 12 points in the blowout victory.The Knicks lost out on the Goran Dragic sweepstakes to the Heat on Thursday and then lost to Miami on Friday. Langston Galloway continues to be one of the few bright spots for New York this season. He led his team with 19 points on 7-of-14 shooting. Tim Hardaway led all reserves with 17 points in 30 minutes.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (29-25) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (36-20) 104-89 on Thursday at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. Russell Westbrook picked up where he left off with another great performance. Westbrook finished the night with a game-high 34 points on an efficient 9-for-17 shooting performance from the floor to go with 10 assists. The Thunder built a commanding lead in the third quarter, but the Mavericks chipped away at it to make the game competitive late until Oklahoma City finally pulled away. The Thunder have now moved into the eighth spot in the Western Conference.The Mavericks had Tyson Chandler and Rajon Rondo return to action Thursday, but that wasn't enough to secure a victory against a surging Thunder team. Dallas was badly out-rebounded Thursday by a count of 62 to 39. The Mavericks also shot a woeful 36 percent from the floor. Dallas has a quick turnaround, with a matchup against Houston coming on Friday. Oklahoma City capped off a busy Thursday trade-deadline with a big win over a playoff contender. In addition to Westbrook's big night, Serge Ibaka had a 20-20 outing with 21 points and 22 rebounds. The Thunder made moves for Enes Kanter and DJ Augustin as well on Thursday, adding depth as it begins its push towards the postseason. Oklahoma City will return to action Saturday in Charlotte.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (36-19) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (34-20) 119-115 at the Staples Center. With Blake Griffin sidelined and DeAndre Jordan struggling at the free throw line, Jamal Crawford was the hero for the Clippers on Thursday. Crawford finished with 26 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. It was a back-and-fourth affair throughout, especially in the fourth quarter. The Spurs used the hack-a-Jordan approach on DeAndre Jordan to the tune of Jordan attempting 28 free throws, making only 10 of them. San Antonio is comfortably in playoff position, but missed an opportunity to steal a win on the road to gain ground in the West. Tim Duncan turned in a big performance with 30 points and 11 rebounds and Tony Parker looked good with 21 points and 13 assists. The Spurs have another big test Friday on their nine-game road swing as they will travel to Oakland to take on the Warriors. Los Angeles has now won three straight without Blake Griffin after holding off San Antonio on Thursday. DeAndre Jordan narrowly missed out on another 20-20 game as he finished with 26 points and 18 boards. Chris Paul had a big game as well with 22 points and 16 assists over 40 minutes. The Clippers will look to continue their winning streak on Saturday against the Kings.

												The Chicago Bulls (34-20) handled the Cleveland Cavaliers (33-22), 113-98, on Thursday.Chicago enters the All-Star break with a four-game winning streak in hand, during which they held each opponent below 100 points. On the backs of five players achieving double-digit points, the Bulls outscored the Cavaliers in each quarter, yet remain behind in the season series, 1-2. Derrick Rose led the way with 30 points, marking just the fourth time this season he's surpassed that threshold. In the frontcourt, both Pau Gasol (18 points and 10 rebounds) and Joakim Noah (10 points and 15 boards) tallied double-doubles, with the Spaniard notching his 14th in row. Meanwhile, Tony Snell garnered his third starting nod in six contests due to the absences of Jimmy Butler (shoulder) and Kirk Hinrich (toe), and the second-year pro responded with 22 points and a game-high four three-pointers in 38 minutes. Once Chicago returns from their midseason respite, the Detroit Pistons await on Friday, Feb. 20 in the Palace of Auburn Hills.Thursday's defeat doubles as Cleveland's second in four outings, but LeBron James did everything in his power to keep the deficit somewhat close, accruing 31 points, five rebounds, and four assists. However, with Kevin Love out of commission as a result of a corneal abrasion sustained during Wednesday's win against the Miami Heat, the road was all the more winding when 16 turnovers were transformed into 24 points for the Bulls. The Cavaliers' foibles on offense were compounded by miserable success from three-point range -- just 8-for-31, or 26 percent -- and subsequently, just three of James' teammates scored in double figures, including Kyrie Irving (17), Timofey Mozgov (13), and Tristan Thompson (10). After the break, Cleveland will embark upon a three-game road trip, tipping off first against the Washington Wizards on Friday, Feb. 20.

												The Orlando Magic (17-39) defeated the New York Knicks (10-43) 89-83 on Wednesday at the Amway Center.Defense prevailed throughout this low scoring affair as Orlando held New York to 34% shooting from the field. On the other end of the floor, Orlando's Nikola Vucevic had another stellar game against New York. Vucevic ended with 28 points and 18 rebounds to notch his 32nd double-double of the season.  New York came into this game with a patchwork lineup after Carmelo Anthony was sidelined with lingering knee issues. Tim Hardaway Jr. moved into the starting lineup and contributed 10 points on 2-of-9 shooting. Jason Smith exploded for 21 points in the first half, but added just four points the rest of the way. The Knicks will resume play Feb. 20 against the Heat. Orlando was able to go into the All-Star break on a high note and avoided its 13th loss in 14 contests. The Magic got strong performances from some unlikely players after Channing Frye had to leave the game with a dislocated finger. Dewayne Dedmon had six blocks in 21 minutes before fouling out and Willie Green put up 13 points off the bench. Orlando will return to action Feb. 20 against New Orleans.

												The Boston Celtics (20-31) made an unbelievable comeback to defeat the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks (43-10) 89-88 on Wednesday at the TD Garden.When Atlanta's Mike Scott jammed an alley oop home to put the Hawks up 79-65 in the fourth, it looked like this was going to be another easy win for the top team in the East. However, the Celtics made an unbelievable push to storm back. Boston called on Evan Turner on inbounds play with six seconds left and Turner hit a floater to give the Celtics the lead with under a second remaining. Atlanta seemed poised to enter the All-Star break on a two game winning streak, but was unable to close out Boston. Every starter except for Al Horford had poor nights shooting, highlighted by Jeff Teague's 4-for-12 performance and Paul Millsap's 3-for-11 outing. The Hawks have a tough stretch awaiting on the other side of the break with the Raptors, Bucks, and Mavericks on the slate.Boston was able to overcome a 32 percent shooting performance on the night as the Celtics got several great fourth quarter showings. Jared Sullinger shook off a rough first half to finish the night with 17 points and 15 rebounds. Avery Bradley hit a three-pointer to bring Boston within one point with just under two minutes to go. The Celtics go into the break on a high note and will resume play with a three-game road swing starting in Sacramento on Feb. 20.

												The San Antonio Spurs (34-19) defeated the Detroit Pistons (21-33) 104-87 on Wednesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.The Spurs came out and got off to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Pistons 20-12 right away in the first quarter. To go along with the quick start, the Spurs also shot the ball well, going 47 percent from the field, while the Pistons went 41 percent from the floor. To put the icing on the cake, the Spurs finished with a 45-36 rebounding advantage, helping push them to a convincing 17-point victory.The Spurs backcourt of Tony Parker and Danny Green did the bulk of the damage for the Spurs in this one. Green went 7-for-13 from the field and 5-for-10 from the three-point line to finish with 19 points, while also adding eight rebounds and four assists. After failing to reach double figures in points over his last four games, he finally got back into a rhythm and led the team in scoring Wednesday. Parker was just behind Green, recording 17 points (6-10 FG, 5-5 FT), three rebounds and six assists. He's put in two great performances in a row, combining for 36 points and 12 assists during that stretch. After coming off the bench Monday, Aron Baynes moved back into the starting lineup. In 24 minutes, he posted 12 points (6-8 FG) and four rebounds. Both Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli reached double-digit points off the bench, with 13 and 10 points respectively.Like the Spurs, the majority of the Pistons offense came from their backcourt. Point guard DJ Augustin finished with 22 points (8-18 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT), three rebounds and six assists. He's been very impressive lately, averaging 20.5 points and 7.5 assists over his last four games. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also had a solid showing, posting 20 points (7-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds. Considering he's averaging 11.8 points on the season, it was a nice surprise for the Pistons. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Andre Drummond, who nearly recorded a double-double with 10 points (4-10 FG, 2-6 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. It was his lowest scoring performance over his last six games, as he couldn't get anything going against the Spurs. It was the third time in his last four games with two blocks though.The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday after the All-Star break, while the Pistons will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday after the All-Star break as well.

												The Toronto Raptors (36-17) defeated the Washington Wizards (33-21)  95-93 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.With just under 13 seconds left in the game, DeMar DeRozan was able to hit a jump shot, putting the Raptors up by two. On the Wizards next posession, John Wall attempted to drive to the hoop, but got blocked by Kyle Lowry. The Wizards got the ball back after the block, and Wall had one more shot to win the game, but he missed a three-pointer at the buzzer, giving the Raptors the close two-point victory in front of their home crowd. While the Wizards (46 percent) shot better than the Raptors from the field (41 percent), the Raptors took the advantage from the three-point line, going 42 percent from deep, while the Wizards went just 24 percent.Along with the go-ahead bucket that helped give the Raptors a victory, DeRozan also posted 23 points (6-18 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 10-10 FT), three rebounds and three steals in the victory. He's on an impressive stretch of three games where he's averaging 21.7 points, five rebounds and 2.7 steals per game. The Raptors also received a huge contribution off the bench, as Louis Williams went 8-for-16 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score 27 points in 33 minutes. It was a nice turn of events for him, after going scoreless in Sunday's game against the Spurs. He's now averaging 14.9 points on the season. Along with the block of Wall in the final seconds, Lowry also added 13 points (5-12 FG, 3-7 3Pt), four rebounds and six assists. His points totals were down, but with DeRozan and Williams playing so well, he didn't have to do as much offensively. Greivis Vasquez recorded 11 points (4-7 FG, 3-5 3PT) in just 18 minutes as well.  John Wall led the team for the Wizards, but just couldn't come up clutch in the final moments. He finished with 21 points (7-15 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 6-8 FT), four rebounds and eight assists. He shot only 30 percent (3-10 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Magic, so it was nice to see some improvement with his shot. Paul Pierce also played a factor, going 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 17 points. After combining for just eight points over his last two games, he was much more efficient with his time Wednesday. Nene had a solid showing, posting 14 points (7-8 FG, 0-2 FT), four rebounds and four steals. It was his second straight night with 14 points, while the four steals matched a season-high.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (30-23) defeated the Sacramento Kings (18-34) 111-103 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 43 percent from the floor and just 36 percent from beyond the arc. The Kings made a run in the fourth quarter, out-scoring the Bucks 34-24, but the Bucks were able to hold off the charge and secure an eight-point victory in front of their home crowd.Continuing his strong play this season, Brandon Knight did it again Wednesday, finishing with 20 points (8-14 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT), six rebounds and five assists. He had an awful outing against the Nets Monday, shooting just 17 percent (2-12 FG) from the field, so it was good to see him get back in a rhythm and shoot well. Khris Middleton had a strong showing as well, recording a double-double with 15 points (4-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-6 FT), 10 rebounds and two steals. He's had a nice stretch of two games, combining for 33 points, 14 rebounds and six steals. The Bucks did get some huge production from their bench, as O.J. Mayo went off for 21 points (6-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 7-7 FT), and four assists in just 25 minutes. He's been turning it on lately, averaging 15.6 points over his last five games. Giannis Antetokounmpo also played a factor, finishing with 13 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-7 FT), seven rebounds and two steals.For the Kings, DeMarcus Cousins did the bulk of the work, recording a game-high of 28 points (9-20 FG, 10-12 FT), to go along with 19 rebounds and four blocked shots. He's been dominant lately, averaging 24.5 points and 12.3 rebounds over his last four games. Rudy Gay had another strong showing, posting 17 points (7-12 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT), eight rebounds and three assists. It was his second game in a row shooting over 55 percent, as he's combined to go 17-of-30 from the field over that stretch. The third member of the starters to reach double figures was Ben McLemore. He went 5-for-12 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score 16 points in 30 minutes. Ray McCallum added 11 points (4-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and four assists off the bench.The Bucks' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Friday after the All-Star break, while the Kings will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday after the All-Star break as well.

												The Indiana Pacers (21-33) cruised to an 106-93 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans (27-26) on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center. The Pelicans sorely missed Anthony Davis once again as they didn't have a single player score more than 15 points. The Pacers were led by George Hill, who finished with 17 points and nine assists over 29 minutes of action. Indiana scored their seventh win against Western Conference competition Wednesday and enters the All-Star break in decent position in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Pacers have now won four of their last five games. They will return to action Feb. 20 against the 76ers in Philadelphia.New Orleans has been decimated by injuries of late. Anthony Davis missed his second straight game Wednesday, and his absence was apparent. Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans combined for 5-for-20 shooting to finish with just 14 points between them. The Pelicans will return to action Feb. 20 against the Magic.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (28-25) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (39-14) 105-89 on Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.The Thunder had a huge first half against the Grizzlies, out-scoring them 66-48 to begin the game. The Thunder also shot much better than them, going 45 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Grizzlies went just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 17 percent from deep. With the quick start and superior shooting, the Thunder never even gave the Grizzlies a chance of making a comeback.The Thunder couldn't be more happy with having both Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook healthy, as they were both dominant in this one. Durant went 9-for-15 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 26 points, while also adding 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. He's had a very strong stretch of three games, where he's averaging 31.7 points and 6.3 rebounds. Westbrook, on the other hand, finished with 24 points (4-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 15-15 FT), nine rebounds and nine assists, coming just shy of a triple-double. Like Durant he's been on fire of late, averaging 32.4 points and eight assists over his last five games. The Thunder also received some solid contributions from their bench with both Dion Waiters and Nick Collison reaching double figures. Waiters had 11 points (5-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and one assist, while Collison recorded 15 points (6-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots.The Grizzlies got most of their production from superstar Zach Randolph, who finished with 16 points (5-15 FG, 6-6 FT), 11 rebounds and four assists. In back-to-back games against the Nets and Thunder, he's combined for 35 points and 19 rebounds, showing no signs of slowing down. The only other starter to reach double-digit points was Jeff Green, who posted 11 points (4-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and two assists in 27 minutes. Like the majority of the Grizzlies Wednesday, he just wasn't hitting on many of his shots. Beno Udrih and Nick Calathes had some production off the bench. Udrih recorded 11 points (4-11 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and one rebound, while Calathes had 10 points (5-8 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and four assists.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (33-21) routed the Miami Heat (22-30) 113-93 on Wednesday at the Quicken Loans Arena. The Cavaliers avenged their Christmas Day loss to the Heat with an easy victory Wednesday. Cleveland did not escape unscathed, however, as Kevin Love left the game in the third quarter with an eye injury. LeBron James had a double-double against his former team, finishing with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Miami was without Dwayne Wade once again, but his participation in Tuesday's practice indicates that he's nearing a return. Hassan Whiteside had another outstanding game as he finished the game with 17 points and 14 rebounds in just 28 minutes. The Heat have a slim one-game lead over the Nets for the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoff picture. Cleveland's has only lost one time since Jan. 15. The Cavaliers got a good game out of their center as well, with Timofey Mozgov putting up a team-high 20 points on 7-of-8 shooting. The Cavaliers recent push has put them into the top half of the Eastern Conference playoff pool. Cleveland will travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Thursday in the final game before the All-Star break. 											",Cleveland,Cavaliers,Miami,Heat,Quicken Loans Arena,22,30,33,21,10.0,25.0,44.0,78.0,15.0,19.0,43.0,31.0,15.0,8.0,23.0,33.0,83.0,16.0,20.0,36.0,21.0,14.0,LeBron James,9.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,31,Luol Deng,7.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,17.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,40,Kevin Love,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,19,Chris Bosh,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,17.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,36,Timofey Mozgov,8.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,20.0,9.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Hassan Whiteside,14.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,JR Smith,4.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,33,Mario Chalmers,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,16.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,37,Kyrie Irving,4.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,38,Shabazz Napier,2.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,24,Iman Shumpert,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,22,Danny Granger,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Tristan Thompson,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,36,Norris Cole,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,21,Matthew Dellavedova,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Chris Andersen,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Shawn Marion,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Tyler Johnson,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15,Joe Harris,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,Udonis Haslem,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9

												The Dallas Mavericks (36-19) defeated the Utah Jazz (19-34) 87-82 on Wednesday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.The Mavericks got off to a quick start Wednesday, out-scoring the Jazz 22-9 in the first quarter alone. Despite the defeat, the Jazz were the superior shooters, going 38 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three-point line, while the Mavericks went 37 percent from the floor and 36 percent from deep. The Mavericks did force the Jazz into 19 turnovers though, while committing only 11 of their own, which may have been the difference in this one.The Mavericks had only two players reach double figures in points. J.J. Barea led the team as the starting point guard, goint 8-for-15 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 22 points, to go along with four rebounds and three assists. He's turned it on offensively, scoring 15 or more points in three out of his last four games. Dirk Nowitzki was the other high scorer, finishing with 15 points (5-14 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), 14 rebounds and two steals in 33 minutes. It marked a season-high in rebounds for him, while the double-double was his first since December seventeenth. While he didn't do too much on the offensive side of the ball with only seven points (1-6 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), Monta Ellis had a huge impact defensively, grabbing a season-high of seven steals, as he was a big part in forcing the Jazz into 19 turnovers.The Jazz were led by Trey Burke off the bench, who went 6-for-15 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also adding six rebounds and four assists. The 16 points were more than he's scored over his last three games, as he combined for only 15 points during that stretch. Steve Novak was also very efficient off the bench, scoring 12 points (4-6 3Pt) in just 12 minutes. It was his second straight night posting 12 points in a very limited amount of time on the court. In the starting lineup, Derrick Favors had the best game offensively, posting 14 points (5-10 FG, 4-6 FT), five rebounds and three blocked shots. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 18.0 points and 6.5 rebounds over that span. Gordon Hayward added 12 points (5-14 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-2 FT), nine rebounds and eight assists, nearly recording a triple-double.  The Mavericks' next game will be on the road against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday after the All-Star break, while the Jazz will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday after the All-Star break as well.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (36-17) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (13-40) 102-86 on Wednesday at the Moda Center in Portland.The Trail Blazers got off to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Lakers 32-24 in the first quarter alone. They also shot better in this game, going 41 percent from the field, while the Lakers went just 37 percent. The Trail Blazers managed to secure a 52-48 rebounding advantage as well, helping to further their lead. With the quick start and superior shooting, the Trail Blazers were able to coast to an easy win.The Trail Blazers' big three of Damian Lillard, LaMarcus Aldridge and Wesley Matthews all had very impressive performances Wednesday. Matthews led the team, going 7-for-14 from the field and 3-for-7 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while adding five rebounds as well. After shooting just 22 percent (2-9 FG) from the field in Sunday's game against the Rockets, it was good to see him get dialed back in and have a strong performance. Aldridge was also big in this game, recording a double-double with 18 points (6-20 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and 12 rebounds in 28 minutes. He's now posted a double-double in seven of his last eight games, as he continues to be a force for the Blazers. Playing a factor in the win as well, Lillard posted 15 points (5-8 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and eight assists. He's now averaging 21.6 points and 6.3 assists on the season. Coming off the bench, both Meyers Leonard and C.J. McCollum reached double figures with 11 and 10 points respectively.The Lakers got the bulk of their production from their backcourt duo of Jordan Clarkson and Wayne Ellington. In 27 minutes, Clarkson finished with 17 points (6-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT), six rebounds and four assists, as he was one of the few bright spots in the loss. While he hasn't been extremely consistent as a starter, he still has scored 14 points or more in three of his last four games. Ellington, on the other hand, went 6-for-14 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while adding eight rebounds and a steal. It was his second strong showing in a row, a stretch where he's combined for 34 points and 12 rebounds. Coming off the bench, Wesley Johnson had the biggest contribution. In 23 minutes, he finished with 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and two rebounds. It was his third straight game in double figures, despite averaging 9.3 points per game on the season.  The Trail Blazers' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Friday after the All-Star break, while the Lakers will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday after the All-Star break as well.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (35-19) defeated the Houston Rockets (36-17) 110-95 Wednesday at the Staples CenterThe Clippers were without Blake Griffin for the third game in a row, but that didn't stop them from notching their second straight victory. Los Angeles held James Harden, the league's leading scorer who was coming off of back-to-back 40-point games, to just nine points. Houston tried to close the gap in the fourth by sending DeAndre Jordan to the line as many times as possible, but Jordan was able make enough free throw attempts to help ice the game. Jordan finished 12-26 from the line. While the free-throw shooting was far from stellar, Jordan still finished with 24 points and 20 rebounds. The Clippers have taken the first two meetings with the Rockets this season. They will meet again on Feb. 25. Houston was playing the second game of a back-to-back Wednesday after Tuesday's 127-118 track meet in Phoenix. The Rockets relied heavily on their three-point shooting, but to no avail as they shot just 9-44 from beyond the arc. The Rockets enter the break with the same record as the Trail Blazers at 36-17. Los Angeles came into the week looking like a team that was nearing panic-mode. The Clippers lost four in a row last week and lost Blake Griffin for at least three weeks with a staph infection in his elbow.

												The Detroit Pistons (21-32) routed the Charlotte Hornets (22-30) 106-78 on Tuesday at the Time Warner Cable Arena. In a game between two teams fighting for one of the last playoff spots in the East, Detroit dominated the third quarter to give the Pistons a decisive advantage. The Pistons entered the game ranked 21st in the league in scoring, but that wasn't evident as they were able to top 100 points for the fifth time in six games. Detroit didn't only have an excellent offensive showing, it also played suffocating defense, holding Charlotte under 80 points. With Tuesday's victory, Detroit has now won four of its last six games. The Pistons got another big game from Greg Monroe, who finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds for another double-double. Detroit will host San Antonio on Wednesday before heading into the All-Star Break. Charlotte had quietly been playing very well of late, but dropped its third straight game Tuesday. The Hornets were missing Michael Kidd-Gilchrist again, as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury he suffered Saturday against Philadelphia. On the bright side, P.J Hairston had a career-high 16 points in 26 minutes on the floor. The Hornets head into the All-Star break sitting in the eighth spot in the East.

												The Houston Rockets (36-16) held off the Phoenix Suns (29-25) in a shootout Tuesday, winning 127-118.James Harden was once again the story of the night as he torched the Suns for his sixth 40-point performance of the season. Harden finished the night with 40 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists in 43 minutes on the floor. 20 of his 40 points came in the fourth quarter as the Rockets were able to stave off a huge comeback by the Suns. Houston has now won all three games against Phoenix this season.Houston was coming off a tough 109-98 loss at home to Portland on Sunday, but was able to bounce back in Phoenix. The Rockets were without Terrence Jones for this game after being ruled out with flu-like symptoms. Despite being under-manned up front, the Rockets were able to out-rebound the Suns 47-39. The Rockets have a meeting with the Clippers in Los Angeles on Wednesday before heading into the All-Star Break. Phoenix heads into the break having lost four of its last five games. The Suns stormed back from an early 18-point deficit to make the game competitive, but were unable to secure the victory. Eric Bledsoe returned from his one-game absence (paternity leave) and played very well. Bledsoe ended the night with 32 points, four rebounds, and four assists. The Suns will return to action Feb. 20 against the Timberwolves. 											",Phoenix,Suns,Houston,Rockets,Talking Stick Resort Arena,36,16,29,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P.J.

												The Chicago Bulls (33-20) defeated the Sacramento Kings (18-33) 104-86 on Tuesday at the United Center in Chicago.The Bulls got off to a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Kings 57-49 in the first half. Along with their quick start, the Bulls also used their superior shooting to grab an advantage, going 53 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 47 percent from the floor and a meager 17 percent from beyond the arc. To put the icing on the cake, the Bulls forced the Kings into 13 turnovers, while committing just seven of their own.Continuing his dominance of late, Pau Gasol had another huge game, finishing with 26 points (11-15 FG, 4-4 FT), 16 rebounds and three assists. Over his last three games he's averaging 23.7 points and 15.3 rebounds, while he's also posted 13 double-doubles in a row, so he's shown no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Derrick Rose also played a big factor in this game, recording 23 points (10-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT), seven assists and two steals. Like Gasol, he's turned it on offensively of late, posting 20 or more points in four of his last five games. Coming off the bench, Tony Snell was also able to surpass the 20-point mark. He went 9-for-11 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 24 points, to go along with two assists in 41 minutes. Between Gasol, Rose and Snell, they combined to score 73 of the 104 total points from the Bulls.The Kings got the majority of their production from Rudy Gay, who went 10-for-18 from the floor and 1-for-4 from beyond the arc to score 24 points, to go along with seven rebounds and five assists. After struggling to only four points and just one assist in Saturday's matchup with the Jazz, it was good to see him get things turned back around and have a decent performance. DeMarcus Cousins also played well, finishing with 15 points (5-15 FG, 5-10 FT), eight rebounds and eight assists. It was the first time in six games that he scored under 20 points and recorded under 10 rebounds, so that may have hurt the Kings chances a little bit. Both Ben McLemore and Ray McCallum reached double figures with 11 points each. It was a nice surprise for McCallum, who hadn't scored more than eight points since January sixteenth.The Bulls' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, while the Kings will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Wednesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (39-13) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (21-31) 95-86 on Tuesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.The Grizzlies got off to a hot start in this matchup, out-scoring the Nets 32-15 in the first quarter alone. Along with the quick start, the Grizzlies used their three-point shooting to grab an advantage, going 32 percent from deep, while the Nets went just 25 percent from beyond the arc. The Nets were really sloppy in this game, and were forced into 20 turnovers, which ended up just being too much for them to come back from.In the victory, the Grizzlies saw Zach Randolph play well, finishing with a team-high of 19 points (9-17 FG, 1-1 3Pt), while also adding eight rebounds and three steals. After scoring 11 points or less in each of his last two games, it was good to see him get things going again on the offensive side of the ball. Courtney Lee was another player who had a successful showing Tuesday. He went 6-for-10 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 15 points in 26 minutes. He shot only 30 percent (3-10 FG) against the Hawks on Sunday, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Notching a double-double, Marc Gasol posted 14 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-8 FT), 11 rebounds and two blocked shots. It marked his second double-double in a row, as he's combined for 30 points and 21 rebounds over those two games. Coming off the bench, both Tony Allen and Beno Udrih reached double figures as well, with 12 and 13 points respectively.The Nets got contributions from all over the court, with six players reaching double figures in points. Mason Plumlee led the team, posting 15 points (6-10 FG, 3-3 FT), 14 rebounds and three steals. It marked his first double-double since January sixteenth, while the three assists matched a season-high. Alan Anderson recorded 15 points (5-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds. Considering he's averaging 6.6 points on the year, it was a nice suprise for the Nets despite the loss. Coming just short of a double-double, Joe Johnson finished with 11 points (5-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-1 FT), eight rebounds and four assists. He's now averaging 15.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game on the season. The Nets saw some contributions from their bench as well. Brook Lopez had 12 points (5-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds, while Deron Williams posted 10 points (4-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and four assists.The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, while the Nets will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday.

From there, Denver's Ty Lawson took over. Lawson had 16 points in the fourth, including nine in the final two minutes to seal the victory for the Nuggets. The star point guard finished the game with 32 points and 16 assists to help Denver snap its six-game losing skid. Denver goes into the All-Star break on a high note after winning its first game since Jan.28. In addition to Lawson's remarkable performance, Denver got solid contributions from bench players such as Darrell Arthur, J.J. Hickson, and Randy Foye. JaVale McGee returned to action for the Nuggets after a four-game absence, but only logged one minute of playing time. Denver will return to action on Feb. 20 against Milwaukee. Los Angeles made a late charge in the fourth quarter with some big time shooting from Wesley Johnson and Nick Young, but was unable to complete the comeback as the Lakers failed to score a point in the final 1:37 of the game. The Lakers relied heavily on their bench throughout the game with five reserve players logging more than 20 minutes of playing time. Carlos Boozer led the team in scoring with 21 points on 8-for-15 shooting. The Lakers have one last chance to break their losing streak before the break with a matchup against the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (33-19) defeated the Indiana Pacers (20-33), 95-93, on Monday.The Spurs avoided losing back-to-back games once again, and have only lost to one opponent with a sub .500 record since the beginning of January. Matt Bonner got the start for San Antonio, after playing just 18 seconds in Sunday's 87-82 loss at the hands of the Toronto Raptors. He logged 12 minutes this time around but was the only Spur not to score a point. Head coach Gregg Popovich reached a milestone with the victory, achieving his 1000th win. With a grand under his belt, he and the Spurs will turn their attention to the Detroit Pistons, the lone team under .500 to beat them thus far in 2015.The Pacers' George Hill almost spoiled the party for Popovich and his former team. Hill missed a three-pointer with less than a second remaining that would have given his team a buzzer-beating game-winner at home. The contest had been tied when Indiana gave up a Marco Belinelli bucket with two seconds left, leaving Hill with limited time to try and win the game.The Spurs will continue their road trip Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons. Meanwhile, the Pacers will travel to New Orleans to face off with the Pelicans on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (41-9) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (12-41) 89-84 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.Both teams seemed to struggle shooting the ball in this one. The Warriors went just 40 percent from the field and 24 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers finished at 42 percent from the floor and 29 percent from beyond the arc. While the Sixers may have ended with higher shooting percentages, they turned the ball over a ridiculous 27 times, which would be hard for any team to come back from and have any chance at a victory.Stephen Curry did most of the damage for the Warriors, recording 20 points (7-20 FG, 3-12 3Pt, 3-4 FT), six assists and three steals. While this kind of offensive output is expected out of Curry, he also continues to be very consistent defensively, as he's posted two or more steals in nine out of his last ten games. Fellow backcourt superstar Klay Thompson didn't have his best outing, finishing with just 13 points (4-14 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three assists. His field goal percentage was under 30 percent for the second straight game, as he's seemingly struggling with his shot. He'll look to get that dialed back in before Wednesday's matchup with the Timberwolves. In a surprise performance off the bench, Leandro Barbosa went 5-for-7 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to finish with 16 points and six rebounds in just 19 minutes. He was very efficient with his time and could be in line for more minutes going forward.The Sixers had all five starters reach double figures in this game, although their bench didn't find as much success and combined for just 19 points. Leading the team in scoring, Robert Covington finished with 21 points (7-15 FG, 4-10 3Pt, 3-3 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and three steals. With Michael Carter-Williams out due to a toe injury, Covington became the go-to guy on the offensive side of the ball and did everything he could to keep the Sixers alive. Luc Mbah a Moute came just shy of notching a double-double, posting 13 points (5-13 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and nine rebounds in 35 minutes. He's had a strong stretch of three games where he's averaging 14.7 points and 6.3 rebounds, both of which are higher than his season averages up until this point. Nerlens Noel chipped in with 11 points (5-8 FG, 1-2 FT) and seven rebounds, while Tim Frazier replaced Carter-Williams at point guard and had 10 points (4-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT), six rebounds and seven assists.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Friday.

												The Washington Wizards (33-20) defeated the Orlando Magic (16-39) 96-80 on Monday at the Verizon Center in Washington.The Wizards came out and got a quick start in this one, out-scoring the Magic 24-16 right away in the first quarter. Along with the fast start, the Wizards also shot better than the Magic, going 43 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic went 40 percent from the floor and a meager 18 percent from beyond the arc. To put the icing on the cake, the Wizards also secured a 53-33 rebounding advantage.The Wizards had a balanced attack against the Magic, with the bench adding some valuable contributions. Leading the team in points was Rasual Butler, who posted 15 points (4-14 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and three rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench. It was his second straight 15-point game in a row, as he's been a big reason the Wizards have won each of their last two games. Marcin Gortat had a strong showing and finished with 14 points (5-6 FG, 4-4 FT) and 14 rebounds. He was a force on the boards and was a big help in securing such an impressive advantage in the rebounding category. Coming just shy of a triple-double, John Wall recorded nine points (3-10 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-3 FT), 10 rebounds and 10 assists. It was the first time he failed to reach double figures in points since December fifth, although he made up for it with a new season-high in rebounds. Nene added 14 points (6-10 FG, 2-2 FT) and three rebounds as well.Like the Wizards, the Magic's highest scorer was off the bench Tuesday, as Evan Fournier finished as the team leader in points. He went 7-for-14 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding two assists in 33 minutes. He continues to provide the Magic solid guard depth off the bench, as he's now pushed his season averages to 12.2 points and 2.1 assists per game. Nikola Vucevic came close to recording a double-double, finishing with 14 points (6-10 FG, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds. After posting fourteen games in a row with at least 16 points, he's now posted less than that in two straight games, as his shot attempts were noticeably down during that stretch. Also reaching double-digit points was Victor Oladipo, who recorded 13 points (6-18 FG, 0-6 3Pt, 1-1 FT), four rebounds and five assists. Rookie Elfrid Payton contributed 11 points and a season-high of six steals, as he stepped it up defensively for the Magic.The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, while the Magic will be at home against the New York Knicks on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (22-29) defeated the New York Knicks (10-42), 109-95, on Monday.Chris Bosh filled the cup on Monday night, finishing with 32 points and six assists. He also hit 4-of-6 from the three-point line. Hassan Whiteside has been slowed down by an ankle injury of late. While he played just 19 minutes, he had seven points, nine rebounds and two blocks. The Heat were down by 14 points in the first half, but quickly erased the deficit and eventually gained a 14-point lead on the Knicks.After missing the team's previous game Saturday against the Warriors as part of his schedule to rest during the second game of back-to-backs, Carmelo Anthony left Monday's contest with a knee injury. He had 26 points, four assists and four rebounds in 32 minutes before his departure. Regardless, Anthony is highly unlikely to play Wednesday against the Magic and now will take it easy during the All-Star break.On Wednesday, the Knicks will head to Orlando to face the Magic, while the Heat will play the Cleveland Cavaliers at Quicken Loans Arena.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (29-23) beat the Brooklyn Nets (21-30), 103-97, on Monday.Giannis Antetokounmpo continued his streak of season highs. This time, it was in the assists category. He scored 12 points, grabbed nine rebounds, stole the ball three times, and added one block to go along with a season-high eight assists. Seven of the assists came in the first half, as he helped his team recover from a 17-point deficit. For someone who didn't play in the fourth quarter, the statistical line was all the more impressive. Over his past five games, he's averaging 18.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.6 blocks, and 1.0 steals per game. In the frontcourt, Zaza Pachulia returned to the Bucks' lineup after missing six games with a calf injury. He finished with five points, five rebounds and three steals in 16 minutes off the bench.Jarrett Jack had a nice game for the Nets. He put up 26 points on 10-of-15 from the field, and had four rebounds and eight assists to boot. Deron Williams had been suffering from an illness and didn't look like himself, going 0-for-5 from the floor for zero points in 23 minutes off the bench. Joe Johnson played a game-high 42 minutes, scoring 19 points and recording six assists. Brooklyn is currently the first team on the outside looking in at the Eastern Conference playoff picture.The Nets will take on the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Bucks will have a chance to double their win total from last season before the All-Star break when they host the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (43-10) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (11-41) 117-105 on Monday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.The Hawks shot really well in this one, going 51 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves went 45 percent from the floor and just 31 percent from beyond the arc. Despite out-rebounding the Hawks 50-36, they turned the ball over 16 times, which was enough to get themselves in just enough of a hole, that they weren't able to make a run at a comeback.Despite receiving only 20 points from their bench, the Hawks saw all five of their starters reach double figures in scoring. The Hawks frontcourt was the difference in this one, out-scoring the Timberwolves' frontcourt 73-40. Al Horford led the charge, finishing with 28 points (11-18 FG, 6-7 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a new season-high in points for him and a nice bounce back outing, after posting only six points in Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies. DeMarre Carroll also had himself a game, recording 26 points (9-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT), four rebounds and three steals. Like Horford, it was a new season-high for Carroll, along with a nice surprise for the Hawks, as he's averaging just 11.6 points per game so far this season. Nearly recording a triple-double, Paul Millsap finished with 19 points (8-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), nine rebounds and seven assists. The seven assists matched a season-high for him.The Timberwolves were led by Kevin Martin, who went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while also adding five rebounds. He's had two solid games in a row, combining for 45 points and 14 rebounds over that span. After missing a month with an oblique injury, Shabazz Muhammad made his return to the court. In a limited 24 minutes, he played very well and posted 18 points (7-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and eight rebounds. As long as he didn't suffer any setbacks, he should most likely get an increase in playing time moving forward, which would go a long way in helping the Timberwolves improve their offense. Coming just shy of a double-double, Nikola Pekovic finished with 14 points (6-13 FG, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds, while Andrew Wiggins chipped in with 15 points (6-14 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and six rebounds.   The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.

												The Utah Jazz (19-33) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (27-25) 100-96 on Monday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.While going into halftime down 52-42, the Jazz looked to be in for a long game. They came out firing in the third quarter though, where they out-scored the Pelicans 29-15, giving them enough of an advantage to steal a four-point victory on the road against a very tough team. The Jazz were also able to force the Pelicans into 15 turnovers, while committing only 11 of their own, which also may have helped make the difference Monday.Gordon Hayward was unstoppable in this one, going 10-for-22 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to finish with 32 points, while also adding seven rebounds, eight assists and two steals. He's played extremely well over his last two games, combining for 62 points, nine rebounds, 11 assists and four steals over that span. Derrick Favors also did his part and finished with 18 points (8-16 FG, 2-4 FT), seven rebounds and two blocked shots. Over his last three games he's averaging 19.3 points and seven rebounds, as he's really stepped it up for the Jazz lately. Notching a double-double, center Enes Kanter posted 14 points (6-12 FG, 2-2 FT) and 11 rebounds in 28 minutes. It marked his third double-double over his last four games. Coming off the bench, Steve Novak added an efficient 12 points (4-5 3Pt) in 12 minutes.Doing everything he could to keep the Pelicans in this game, Eric Gordon finished with 31 points (9-14 FG, 7-8 3Pt, 6-6 FT), three assists and two steals. It was a new season-high in points for him and also a nice bounce back game after posting just three points in Saturday's game against the Bulls. Tyreke Evans also had a solid showing and recorded 18 points (7-17 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), seven rebounds and 10 assists. With Anthony Davis sitting out due to a shoulder injury, the Pelicans' backcourt tried to make up for his scoring, but they didn't get enough production elsewhere to keep up. The only other player to reach double figures in points was Luke Babbitt, who came off the bench and contributed a season-high of 15 points (6-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and six rebounds in 26 minutes.The Jazz's next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (34-19) beat the Dallas Mavericks (35-19), 115-98, on Monday.The Clippers were in their second game without Blake Griffin, who had surgery Monday to remove a staff infection. They had lost four straight coming into Monday's tilt against the Mavs. DeAndre Jordan dominated the Dallas interior after Tyson Chandler left with an ankle injury in the second minute of the game and didn't return. While he had 22 points, 27 rebounds and three blocks, he miraculously hit 6-of-9 free throws in 39 minutes. The performance marked his second game of at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in February, which he hadn't done that all season until this month. Chris Paul stepped up his scoring in an attempt to help make up for the loss of Griffin, putting up 25 points to go along with six assists and 13 rebounds. Meanwhile, J.J. Reddick (back) made his return to the starting lineup after missing three straight games, posting 15 points in 31 minutes.The Dallas Mavericks had a tough time keeping their starters healthy against the Clippers. In addition to Chandler leaving after playing just over one minute,Monta Ellis suffered a hip injury and did not return after the first four minutes. The Mavs were already without Rajon Rondo (face), who is out until after the All-Star break. However, Dallas did get a bump in production from Charlie Villanueva, who had a game-high 26 points in 23 minutes off the bench.The Clippers will take on the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, and the Mavericks will play the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (27-25) beat the Denver Nuggets (19-33), 124-114, on Monday.Kevin Durant had his second-best scoring performance of the season with 40 points on 13-of-19 from the field. Russell Westbrook added 26 points with five rebounds and nine assists. Starting in place of Steven Adams, who recently had surgery on his fractured hand, Kendrick Perkins played 20 minutes, recording four points and two rebounds. Mitch McGary followed up his 19-point, 10-rebound performance from Sunday with 17 points and 10 rebounds. He didn't play more than 25 minutes in either game but could be a force going forward with Perkins underproducing and Adams out for a few weeks.The Nuggets are slipping fast. They are 1-13 since winning five straight in early January. Kenneth Faried put up 22 points and 10 rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough to overcome Durant's hot shooting night. Jusuf Nurkic had 16 points, 14 rebounds and two steals. Denver was without JaVale McGee (illness) and Jameer Nelson (Achilles), who were both questionable going into Monday's game. The Nuggets are now nine-and-a-half games back from the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.The Thunder will take on the Grizzlies in Memphis on Wednesday, while the Nuggets will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (26-25) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (33-19) 131-108 on Sunday.The Clippers found out just before the game that All-Star power forward Blake Griffin will undergo surgery to clean out a staph infection in his right elbow. Griffin's return timetable remains unclear with reports suggesting he could be sidelined for anywhere from 2-to-6 weeks following surgery. Spencer Hawes stepped into the starting lineup in place of Griffin and posted 17 points and one rebound in 35 minutes. The Clippers' frontcourt got even thinner Sunday when Glen Davis was forced to leave the game with back spasms. Los Angeles has dropped four straight games as they struggle to compensate for the absences of J.J. Redick (back) and Griffin. The Thunder gained a large advantage Sunday by dominating the glass, out-rebounding the Clippers 54-29. Kevin Durant led the way on offense with a game-high 29 points and six assists, while Russell Westbrook continued his torrid stretch with 19 points, 11 rebounds and five assists in 32 minutes. He was coming off back-to-back scoring performances of 48 and 45 points. Kendrick Perkins sat out the game due to a one-game suspension for dangerous contact with Tyreke Evans' head in the Thunder's loss to the Pelicans on Friday. With Perkins out, the Thunder opted to give rookie Mitch McGary a career-high 23 minutes off the bench in just the third game of his career. McGary put up an impressive 19-point, 10-rebound double-double. Oklahoma City remains 2.5 games out of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. They'll go on the road to face the Nuggets on Monday.The Clippers have fallen into seventh place in the Western Conference standings, and the absence of Griffin might put them in danger of getting booted from the playoffs. They'll wrap up their current eight-game road trip Monday in Dallas.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (35-17) defeated the Houston Rockets (35-16) 109-98 on Sunday.After voicing his displeasure regarding being looked over for an All-Star spot, Damian Lillard was the beneficiary of the Clippers' Blake Griffin having to undergo surgery for a staph infection, and Lillard will now be headed to the All-Star Game in Griffin's stead. Lillard celebrated with an efficient 23 points on 6-of-10 shooting from the field and 10-of-11 from the line. He struggled with his shot over the last couple weeks, so it's possible the announcement that he'll be an All-Star could have relaxed Lillard.Meyers Leonard put up a nice game off the bench, scoring 12 points and pulling down six rebounds in just 15 minutes, while showing off his range on 2-of-4 three-point attempts. The win helped the Trail Blazers secure a third victory in their last four games, with their lone loss coming to the Mavericks on Saturday. Portland lost five of their final six games at the end of January, but their recent play has assuaged most concerns about that rough stretch.James Harden is like the Katniss Everdeen of the NBA; he's on fire. On Sunday, he scored a game-high 45 points for his fifth 40-point game of the season. He got some help from Josh Smith, with Smith hitting a career-high four three-pointers for the third time in the last six games, showing off what may be an improved jumper thanks to the Rockets' coaching. Donatas Motiejunas was the only other Rockets player to finish with double-digit points as the team shot a poor 38 percent from the field and 68 percent from the free-throw line. Despite the loss, the Rockets have won six of the eight games they've played since Dwight Howard went down with his most recent knee injury, proving that they can continue to win even without Howard. They'll play the Suns in Phoenix on Tuesday.The Trail Blazers will return home to host the Lakers on Wednesday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (32-21) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (13-38) 120-105 on Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.In a dominating effort, the Cavaliers got out to a quick start in this matchup, out-scoring the Lakers 64-49 in the first half alone. The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game as well, going 55 percent from the field and 55 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers went just 41 percent from the floor and 30 percent from beyond the arc.The Cavaliers' big three of LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving did most of the damage in this one. Love led all scorers, finishing with 32 points (11-18 FG, 7-8 3Pt, 3-5 FT), 10 rebounds and three assists. After a dissapointing performance in Friday's game against the Pacers, where he finished with just five points, it was good to see him get things turned back around and play well. Also having an impressive showing, Irving recorded 28 points (10-14 FG, 5-8 3Pt, 3-4 FT), four rebounds and ten assists. It marked his fifth double-double of the season. Over his last two games, he's now combined for 57 points, eight rebounds and 15 assists, as he's been dominating his competition. James on the other hand, totaled 22 points (8-16 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 4-5 FT), 10 rebounds and eight assists, nearly recording a triple-double Sunday. He didn't have to do as much work as usual, considering the success of both Love and Irving.For the Lakers, rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson had a solid perfomance, finishing with 20 points (6-14 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 8-9 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was a season-high in points for the rookie, who has now scored 14 points or more in five out his last six games, despite averaging only 7.3 per game on the season. He's been getting more and more comfortable in the starting lineup, and its beginning to show with more consistent play. Without much production from the rest of the starters, the Lakers bench had to put up some numbers. Ed Davis went 6-for-7 from the floor and 4-for-4 from the free throw line to finish with 16 points and nine rebounds in just 24 minutes. He's averaging only 8.1 points per game so far this season, so it was a nice surprise for the Lakers. Also coming off the bench, Wesley Johnson played well. In 29 minutes, he finished with 15 points (5-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT), two assists and two steals. The two steals matched a season-high.    The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (38-13) defeated the Atlanta Hakws (42-10) 94-88 on Sunday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.Despite securing the six-point victory, the Grizzlies didn't have as much success shooting the ball as the Hawks did. The Hawks went 41 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three-point line, while the Grizzlies finished at 39 percent from the floor and a meager 23 percent from beyond the arc. While they may not have had the shooting advantage, the Grizzlies did it elsewhere, as they out-rebounded the Hawks 55-37 and forced them into 14 turnovers, while committing only 11 of their own.Offensively, the Grizzlies leaned on the duo of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Conley went 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to finish with a team-high of 21 points, while also adding six assists. He's been shooting the ball really well lately, shooting higher than 50 percent from the field in three out of his last four games. Gasol, on the other hand, recorded 16 points (6-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. His rebounding numbers were down a bit, as he's recorded less than seven rebounds in each of his last three games, so it was good to see him notch the double-double and get back to producing some higher numbers. Zach Randolph didn't have his best night shooting the ball, but still finished with 11 points (5-16 FG, 1-2 FT), to go along with 15 rebounds and two steals. He's now had at least 10 rebounds in 21 of his last 22 games. Jeff Green added 11 points (3-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and six rebounds.For the Hawks, Jeff Teague did most of the damage offensively. He went 9-for-13 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to finish with 22 points, while also handing out six assists. He's been on a hot stretch of late, averaging 23.7 points and seven assists over his last three games. DeMare Carroll was the only other starter in double figures for points, recording 10 points (3-9 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five rebounds in 29 minutes. The other three starters combined to go 7-for-27 from the field to score just 18 points, which may have played a big factor in the loss. Coming off the bench, Kent Bazemore had the most success, posting 14 points (5-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), five rebounds and two steals in 29 minutes. Considering he's averaging only four points per game on the season, it was a nice surprise for the Hawks. Both Mike Scott and Dennis Schroder added 11 points each.The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, while the Hawks will travel to Minnesota to play the Timberwolves on Monday.

												The Indiana Pacers (20-32) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (22-29) 103-102 on Sunday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.With slightly over 14 seconds left in the game, Marvin Williams was able to hit a three-point shot to put the Hornets up 102-101, but with just under five seconds left, George Hill hit a baseline layup to give the Pacers the one-point lead. Brian Roberts got off a last second, three-point heave at the buzzer, but wasn't able to convert, giving the Pacers their third straight victory in a row and a bunch of momentum moving forward. The Pacers were down 83-75 coming out of the third quarter, but went on a huge run in the fourth, out-scoring the Hornets 28-19 to finish off the game.The Pacers would never have been able to make their comeback if it wasn't for the high production rate from their bench. C.J. Watson was huge in this win, going 7-for-11 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 22 points in just 24 minutes. It was a new season-high in points for him, along with a huge confidence boost, as he went scoreless just a game ago against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. Also off the bench, Luis Scola was a huge part of the Pacers' success. In 25 minutes, he posted 15 points (6-11 FG, 3-4 FT) and a team-high of 14 rebounds, marking his first double-double since the beginning of December. The Pacers did have some valuable contributions from of a few of their starters as well, with Rodney Stuckey and David West each reaching double figures. Stuckey had 15 points (6-12 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and two assists, while West had 15 points (5-13 FG, 5-6 FT), six rebounds and two steals.Despite suffering the tough loss, Al Jefferson continued to show himself as the Hornets' most effective player. He went 13-for-22 from the field and 4-for-5 from the free throw line to finish with 30 points, while also adding 13 rebounds even as he was being guarded by a defensive specialist in Roy Hibbert of the Pacers. He's been very effective over his last two games, combining for 48 points and 22 rebounds. Brian Roberts was back to being a solid scorer as the starting point guard, recording 19 points (8-14 FG, 3-5 3Pt) and five assists. He had a tough day shooting the ball against the 76ers on Saturday, so it was good to see his confidence didn't take a hit and he was able to get things pointed back in the right direction. Coming close to a triple-double, Gerald Henderson finished with 13 points (2-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 9-9 FT), seven rebounds and eight assists. He's had a strong stretch of four games where he's averaged 18.5 points, much higher than his season average of 11.1 points per game. Both Marvin Williams and Gary Neal reached double figures off the bench with 10 and 11 points respectively.The Hornets' next game will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, while the Pacers will be at home against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (11-40) defeated the Detroit Pistons (20-32) 112-101 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.A good portion of this victory can be placed on the Timberwolves' fast start, as they out-scored the Pistons 61-51 in the first half. The Timberwolves also used their superior shooting, considering they went 51 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Pistons finished at 47 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from beyond the arc. Giving them even more of an advantage, the Timberwolves also out-rebounded the Pisonts 40-35, helping them to steal a victory on the road, something they had done only four other times so far this season.The Timberwolves saw six players reach double figures in points, including all five starters. Nikola Pekovic was absolutely unstoppable, recording a game-high of 29 points (9-16 FG, 11-12 FT), while adding three rebounds and two steals. It was a season-high in points for him, as he had yet to surpass the 20-point mark in the 20 games he's played so far this year. Kevin Martin also had a very strong showing, recording 24 points (9-21 FG, 0-6 3Pt, 6-7 FT), nine rebounds and three steals. The three steals marked a new season-high for him as well, contributing to a solid defensive performance. Going 6-for-12 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line, rookie Andrew Wiggins posted 18 points, to go along with eight rebounds and five assists. It was his second straight 18-point performance, pushing his season average to 15.3 points per game. Both Thaddeus Young and Mo Williams did their part in the win. Young had 16 points (6-7 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four assists, while Williams recorded 11 points (2-7 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and nine assists.Depite the loss, D.J. Augustin put up another impressive performance, finishing with 20 points (7-16 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT), and eight assists in 35 minutes. It was the fourth time in his last five games that he's had 20 or more points, a five-game stretch where he's averaging 21.4 points and 10.0 assists. Despite having trouble defending Pekovic, Andre Drummond still posted some solid numbers. He went a perfect 8-for-8 from the field to score 17 points, to go along with 14 rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots in 28 minutes. It marked his fifth straight double-double, while also being the fourth time in the last five games that he's had at least two blocked shots. Coming off the bench, Anthony Tolliver had the most production, finishing with 15 points (4-8 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four rebounds. Both Greg Monroe (5-11 FG, 5-6 FT) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (6-15 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 1-2 FT) each had 15 points as well.   The Timberwolves' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, while the Pistons will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Tuesday.

												The Chicago Bulls (32-20) defeated the Orlando Magic (16-38) 98-97 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando.Down 97-96 with just under 10 seconds left in the game, Pau Gasol was able to to throw down a dunk to put the Bulls up one. The Magic went to Nikola Vucevic for the game winner, but he wasn't able to convert, giving the Bulls the narrow victory on the road in Orlando. While the Magic were able to out-rebound the Bulls 45-35, they were forced into 18 turnovers, which may have been just enough to push the Bulls to win number 32 on the season and keep them a half game ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division.The Bulls saw huge games from both Jimmy Butler and Gasol. Butler was all over the place, recording a team-high of 27 points (9-16 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 6-6 FT), to go along with five assists and an impressive six steals. He's played extremely well of late, averaging 24.0 points, 4.0 steals and 3.7 assists over his last three games. The six steals also matched a season-high. Gasol, on the other hand, posted 25 points (10-16 FG, 5-6 FT) and 15 rebounds in 37 minutes. It was his twelfth double-double in a row, pushing his season averages to 18.1 points and 12 rebounds per game. While slightly over-shadowed by the performances of Butler and Gasol, Joakim Noah had a large impact on this game. He finished with 18 points (7-10 FG, 4-4 FT), nine rebounds and two steals. It matched a season-high in points for him as well and was great for his confidence offensively, as he had combinded for only three points over his last two games. Derrick Rose notched a double-double with 10 points (4-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 11 assists.The Magic saw six players reach double figures in points, including all five of their starters, but still weren't able to hold off the Bulls. Victor Oladipo finished with a team-high of 18 points (8-16 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT), while also adding six assists and two steals. He continues to make a nice contribution defensively, as it was his third straight game recording two steals. He's now averaging 16.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists on the year. Tobias Harris nearly recorded a double-double, posting 15 points (6-17 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT), eight rebounds and three steals. He's had a nice three-game stretch where he's averaged 24.0 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. The ever so consistent Nikola Vucevic had somewhat of a down game, totaling 14 points (5-14 FG, 4-5 FT) and seven rebounds in 32 minutes. It was his lowest scoring output since January ninth against the Lakers, so it came quite unexpected. Coming off the bench, Evan Fournier was very efficient with his time and posted 14 points (5-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT), three rebounds and three assists in only 18 minutes.The Magic's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Bulls will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.

												The Toronto Raptors (35-17) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (32-19) 87-82 on Sunday.The Raptors made a change to their starting lineup, moving James Johnson into the starting small forward spot and shifting Greivis Vasquez back to a bench role. Johnson capitalized on the promotion to score a game-high 20 points in 30 minutes. Vasquez played 16 minutes off the bench and put up five points and two assists. It was a gritty game, with both teams shooting 43 percent or worse from the floor. The Raptors pulled away from the Spurs thanks to their work at the free-throw line. DeMar DeRozan led the charge there, marching to the line to convert 10-of-12 attempts.The Spurs couldn't buy a shot, shooting 33 percent from the field and 25 percent from beyond the arc. Tim Duncan and Marco Belinelli tied for a team-high 12 points, illustrating the Spurs' futility on offense. Toronto is in second place in the Eastern Conference, but they sit seven games behind the conference-leading Hawks. The Raptors will host the Wizards on Wednesday. San Antonio sits in seventh place in the Western Conference standings, 3.5 games ahead of the eighth place Suns. The Spurs will continue their nine-game road trip in Indiana on Monday.

												The Sacramento Kings (18-32) defeated the Phoenix Suns (29-24) 85-83 on Sunday.The Kings went up 2-1 on the Suns for the season series with the win, but former Sacramento teammate Isaiah Thomas did everything he could to try and take home the win for the Suns. Thomas started at point guard with Eric Bledsoe away from the team to attend the birth of his child. With one less guard in the rotation, Thomas played 39 minutes and scored 26 points. Only one other player (Goran Dragic) finished in double figures, with the Suns shooting a woeful 36 percent from the field and 18 percent from beyond the arc.Though the Kings shot better than the Suns from the field (45 percent), they also allowed the Suns to stay in the game by coughing up 17 turnovers and giving up 18 easy points off of them. DeMarcus Cousins led the way with a game-high 28 points and 12 rebounds. Ramon Sessions played well in his second straight spot start in place of Darren Collison (hip), putting up 10 points, seven rebounds and six assists in 32 minutes. Rudy Gay sat out the game with a sore left foot, allowing Omri Casspi to make a spot start in his place.The Suns and Kings will wrap up their season series in Phoenix on Mar. 25.

												The Washington Wizards (32-20) routed the Brooklyn Nets (21-29) 114-77 Saturday at the Verizon Center. Washington came into the game on a five-game losing skid and was without Bradley Beal, but was able to win its second game against Brooklyn this season. The Nets were held to just 38 points in the first half and shot a paltry 33 percent from the field on the night. Brooklyn also managed just three points on fast breaks despite Washington committing 14 turnovers.Brooklyn's three game winning streak was snapped Saturday as Washington took control from the early goings and never let up. Brook Lopez moved into the starting lineup for Kevin Garnett, who was rested for the contest. Lopez finished the night with 19 points and eight rebounds, but he one of the few bright spots for the Nets. Brooklyn has two more road games before the All-Star break, with Milwaukee next on the dockett on Monday. Washington was able to avoid a winless week by beating up on a Brooklyn team that was playing its second game in as many nights. Otto Porter got the start in place of Beal and had a productive game. Porter posted 12 points and four rebounds over 21 minutes on the floor. As for Beal, he aggravated his big toe Thursday and is considered questionable for the Wizards' next game, which comes Monday against the Magic.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (12-40) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (22-28) 89-81 on Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center. Philadelphia won its fourth straight home game despite being without point guard Michael Carter-Williams, who was sidelined with a foot injury. The 76ers were down by six at the half, but outscored the Hornets 28-13 in the third quarter to gain the lead. Charlotte's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went down with a hamstring injury and did not return. The Hornets were outscored by 17 after Kidd-Gilchrist left the contest. Charlotte notched two victories against Washington earlier in the week, but was unable to carry that momentum into Saturday's contest. Lance Stephenson had a tough night from the floor, going 3-for-11 on field goal attempts to finish with six points in 33 minutes on the floor. Charlotte has a slim one-game lead on Miami for the seventh spot in the East, with Brooklyn and Detroit also within striking distance. The Hornets have a quick turnaround as they will host the Pacers on Sunday. Philadelphia bounced back from a 107-96 loss in Boston on Friday to beat a Charlotte team that had won seven of its last ten games entering Saturday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (35-18) pulled off a huge comeback to defeat the Portland Trail Blazers (34-17) 111-101 Saturday at the American Airlines Center.Portland held a 16-point lead early in the fourth, but Dallas took advantage of the Trail Blazers' second unit and began to chip away at the deficit. The Trail Blazers couldn't close out the Mavericks despite having plenty of chances to do so as they were doubled up in the fourth 26-13. Dirk Nowitzki canned an open three to tie it up with twenty seconds remaining in the fourth. Chandler Parsons was a huge difference maker in overtime, scoring 10 points and also securing a key offensive rebound that he then kicked out to Monta Ellis for a three-pointer. Dallas ended the game on a 28-7 run.The Trail Blazers appeared to be well on their way to a third straight win to help minimize the impact of their 3-8 stretch to end January, but let a huge lead slip away en route to their first overtime loss of the season. Chris Kaman returned to the rotation after sitting out Thursday, but only contributed four points and five rebounds in 16 minutes. Portland will finish its back-to-back set in Texas on Sunday with a matchup in Houston.Dallas' comeback victory puts the Mavericks one game ahead of the Trail Blazers in the win column. Dirk Nowitzki, who sat out of Thursday's contest against Sacramento, returned to action and turned in a clutch performance. He finished with 25 points on 11-of-19 shooting. Devin Harris and J.J Barea provided solid production at the point guard spot in Rajon Rondo's absence, combining for 23 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists. Dallas remains undefeated in overtime games this season with a 5-0 record. The Mavericks will host the Clippers on Monday.

												The Spurs (32-18) took care of the Heat (21-29) 98-85 in San Antonio on Friday night. San Antonio jumped out to an 11-point first quarter advantage and led by double-digits for most of the night. Kawhi Leonard set the pace, scoring 24 points to go with four assists, four rebounds and three steals in 33 minutes. Tony Parker chipped in 21 points, and Tim Duncan had a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double. The Spurs shot 48 percent as a team and knocked down 11 three-pointers, five of which came courtesy of Leonard. Meanwhile, the banged-up Heat tumbled to their third straight loss and fifth in six games. Playing without Dwyane Wade and Hassan Whiteside, Miami got 17 points and six rebounds from Luol Deng, while Chris Bosh added 14 points on 7-of-18 shooting. Mario Chalmers and Shabazz Napier combined for only 11 points (4-15 FG), but rookie Tyler Johnson had a team-high 18 in 25 minutes off the bench. Miami has out-rebounded 43-37 and surrendered 42 points in the paint. Up next, the Heat host the Knicks on Monday night. San Antonio travels to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Sunday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (22-27) defeated the Washington Wizards (31-20) for the second time this week, winning 94-87 on Thursday. They say that familiarity breeds contempt, and though these two teams hadn't met this season until Monday, two games in a span of four days caused things to get chippy Thursday at the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte. The game was physical throughout, most notably when John Wall knocked Brian Roberts to the floor on a hard screen in the first half. Tensions boiled over in the fourth when Cody Zeller and Nene Hilario got tangled up, drawing a double technical. The Wizards recent free fall continued and to make things worse, Bradley Beal left the game after 11 minutes with a toe injury. Washington has now dropped five in a row, including two this week to Charlotte. The Wizards got another great showing from John Wall, who finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds while Paul Pierce led the team in scoring with 19 points. Washington's losing streak has caused it to lose ground in the East and is at risk of being tied by Cleveland depending on how the Cavaliers' game ends later Thursday evening. The Wizards will look to snap their losing streak Saturday when they host the Nets.Charlotte is quietly one of the hottest teams in the East right now, having won three in a row and seven of its last ten. Brian Roberts was able to return to the game after being shaken up on the aforementioned pick by Wall and finished with 12 points. Even in Bismack Biyombo's absence, the Hornets were able to out-rebound the Wizards 50-37. The Hornets will return to action Saturday in Philadelphia.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (31-20) continued their hot streak Thursday by dismantling the Los Angeles Clippers (33-17) 105-94 at the Quicken Loans Arena in a game that was not nearly as close as the score would suggest.The Cavaliers had the luxury of resting their starters for the fourth quarter as they entered the period with a commanding 94-63 lead. LeBron James and Kevin Love were dominant when they were on the floor, scoring 23 and 24 points respectively. The Clippers were clearly flustered with the game quickly getting out of hand in the third quarter as Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan each picked up a technical foul and Matt Barnes got ejected after his second. Los Angeles is now 2-3 on its current eight game road trip. The Clippers let a win get away Monday in Brooklyn and did not bring their best effort to Cleveland. J.J Redick was sidelined for Thursday's contest with back spasms, which led to Jamal Crawford getting the start at shooting guard. Los Angeles will look to get the taste of Thursday's loss out of its mouth Friday in Toronto. Cleveland has now won 12 straight games to pull into a tie with Washington for the third seed in the East. In addition to James and Love's solid games, Cleveland got good performances from J.R Smith and Timofey Mozgov. The Cavaliers are rounding into form and look like the team that many predicted to come out of the East before the season started. Cleveland will travel to Indiana on Friday to finish out a back-to-back set. 											",Cleveland,Cavaliers,Los Angeles,Clippers,Quicken Loans Arena,33,17,31,20,8.0,28.0,31.0,69.0,35.0,44.0,51.0,23.0,16.0,4.0,17.0,35.0,84.0,10.0,17.0,40.0,22.0,12.0,LeBron James,3.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,27,Matt Barnes,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,23,Kevin Love,9.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,6.0,14.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,28,Blake Griffin,8.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Timofey Mozgov,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,DeAndre Jordan,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,JR Smith,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,28,Jamal Crawford,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,30,Kyrie Irving,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,31,Chris Paul,2.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,27,Iman Shumpert,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,18,Austin Rivers,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22,Tristan Thompson,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,20,Spencer Hawes,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,17,Matthew Dellavedova,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Glen Davis,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,Mike Miller,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,12,Dahntay Jones,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Shawn Marion,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12,Hedo Turkoglu,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

												The Dallas Mavericks (34-18) defeated the Sacramento Kings (17-31) 101-78 Thursday at the Sleep Train Arena.Dallas was playing its second game in as many nights and was without Dirk Nowitzki, but was able to band together to notch its 34th win of the season to keep pace in the West. J.J Barea got the start at point guard for the injured Rajon Rondo and played very well. In 32 minutes, Barea had 15 points and five assists. The Mavericks played suffocating defense, allowing just 35 points in the second half and holding Sacramento to just 36.7% from the field and 14% from three-point range for the game.Dallas let a big lead over Golden State slip away Wednesday, but was determined to not let a similar lead slip away against Sacramento. The Mavericks bench players made huge contributions in this game, namely Charlie Villanueva and Richard Jefferson. Tyson Chandler continued his dominance on the boards, pulling down 16 rebounds to go with his 16 points. The Mavericks are now 8-4 in the second game of back-to-backs. Dallas is idle Friday before returning home to host Portland.Sacramento was unable to take advantage of Dallas' depleted lineup and dropped its second game in a row. Darren Collison exited the game with an abdominal strain and is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Friday. Jason Thompson moved into the starting lineup, but was held scoreless in 18 minutes of action. The Kings will travel to Utah to take on the Jazz on Saturday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (34-16) went on a huge fourth quarter run to secure the victory over the Phoenix Suns (28-23) 108-87 Thursday at the Moda Center. This was a surprisingly low-scoring game through the first two quarters as both teams struggled from the field. Phoenix outscored Portland 30-20 in the third quarter but was unable to sustain that pace as the Trail Blazers outscored the Suns by 20 points in the fourth. LaMarcus Aldridge's 19 point, 13 rebound double-double made him Portland's all-time leader in double-doubles.  Portland has now strung together consecutive victories for the first time since early January. All five Portland starters scored in double figures, led by Nicolas Batum's 20 points. The Trail Blazers dominated the boards, out-rebounding the Suns 57-42. Portland has a huge game Saturday in Dallas as the Trail Blazers currently hold a one game lead over the Mavericks.Phoenix is slumping at the wrong time, having lost three straight and five of its last ten. The Pelicans are just one game behind the Suns for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference and have won seven of their last ten contests.

												The Indiana Pacers (18-32) defeated the Detroit Pistons (19-31) 114-109 on Wednesday.George Hill led Indiana with 20 points and six assists in 26 minutes. He returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench for five games, since returning from a groin injury. The 26 minutes are the most he has played since coming back. Backup center Ian Mahinmi left after suffering a sprained ankle and did not return. C.J. Miles got the start at small forward, finishing with 15 points and three steals in 27 minutes. Miles replaced Solomon Hill, who had started all but one game this season. The Pacers have now won three of their last five games.Kentavious Caldwell-Pope left the game with an Achilles injury after playing just three minutes. Jodie Meeks came in and helped pick up the slack with 13 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. He is likely to be the man if Caldwell-Pope misses extended time. D.J. Augustin had played well in Detroit's two games prior to Wednesday, averaging 26.5 points and 12.5 assists in those winning efforts. However, he finished with 12 points, six assists and four fouls in 32 minutes. The Pistons will host the Denver Nuggets on Friday, and the Pacers will face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (41-9) beat the Washington Wizards (31-19) 105-96 on Wednesday.The Hawks bounced back after losing their first game of 2015, a 115-100 loss at the hands of the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday. Jeff Teague was Atlanta's top scorer against the Wizards, recording 26 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field. Kyle Korver was kept in the check with just six points in a team-high 37 minutes. He helped get his teammates involved as he dished out six assists. Al Horford has put up at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in three of his last five games.The Wizards have now lost four straight, which is their longest losing streak of the season. They have lost by single-digits in all four games, and are now 0-3 against Atlanta this season. John Wall led Washington with 24 points and nine assists. Bradley Beal was coming off an 18-point, 11-rebound effort against Charlotte on Monday. He proceeded to post 23 points in 39 minutes in this matchup of two of the Eastern Conference's top three teams. Washington did a great job slowing down Korver, but it wasn't enough to get them the win.Washington will take their losing streak to Charlotte on Thursday, while the Hawks will welcome the Golden State Warriors to town Friday.

												The Boston Celtics (18-30) defeated the Denver Nuggets (19-31) 104-100 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston.While they were down three points coming out of the first quarter, the Celtics had a monster second quarter, out-scoring the Nuggets 35-22 and set themselves up to seal the four-point victory in the end. Despite each team shooting close to the same percentage from the floor, the Celtics took a huge advantage from behind the arc, going 43 percent from the three-point line, while the Nuggets finished at a meager 17 percent from deep. The Celtics also out-rebounded the Nuggets 51-48.The Celtics spread the scoring around in this game, with five players reaching double figures. Avery Bradley led the starters, finishing with 17 points (7-15 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds in 31 minutes. He's posted three impressive games in a row, averaging 20.0 points over that stretch. Marcus Thornton matched Bradley, as he came off the bench for 17 points (5-9 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT), five rebounds and two steals in 20 minutes. He was very efficient with his time on the court, playing well on both offense and defense. It was his third straight game with two steals. Jared Sullinger was forced into a bench role, as he showed up late for the Celtics' walk-through. He was still productive though, posting 14 points (5-12 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and seven rebounds in only 21 minutes. Both Tyler Zeller (6-12 FG, 2-3 FT) and Jae Crowder (5-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) each had 14 points as well.The Nuggets continued their tough stretch, losing their fourth game in a row. After struggling to score recently, Ty Lawson finally got things going, finishing with 23 points (9-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT), eight assists and two steals. He had posted 10 or less points in each of his last four games, so will see if this builds his confidence moving forward. Arron Afflalo also had a strong showing. He recorded 18 points (6-17 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and three assists in 36 minutes. He's now averaging 15.1 points and 3.5 rebounds per game on the year. Kenneth Faried recorded a double-double with 17 points (6-8 FG, 5-5 FT) and 11 rebounds. He went scoreless in 19 minues against the 76ers on Tuesday, so the Nuggets were happy he was able to turn things around Wednesday. Jusuf Nurkic added 14 points (4-7 FG, 6-6 FT), seven rebounds and three blocks.The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Friday, while the Celtics will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (20-28) defeated the Toronto Raptors (33-17) 109-93 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.Despite being down 51-49 after the second quarter, the Nets went off in the second half, out-scoring the Raptors 60-42 to close out the game and secure the 16-point victory on the road. The Nets were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors went 44 percent from the floor and just 30 percent from beyond the arc.Starting at point guard, Jarrett Jack led the Nets, going 9-for-13 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 24 points, while also adding six assists as well. He struggled to only six points on 3-of-11 shooting during Monday's game against the Clippers, so it was good to see him get things pointed back in the right direction. Getting the start at shooting guard, Alan Anderson also had a nice showing, finishing with 22 points (7-9 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and five rebounds. It was a season-high in points for Anderson and also a welcomed surprise from the Nets, as he's only averaging 6.1 points per game on the season. Deron Williams continued to come off the bench and posted 11 points (4-12 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and six assists in 32 minutes. It was his second game back since returning from a rib injury, so it was good to see him get a bunch of playing time. Joe Johnson and Bojan Bogdanovic reached double figures as well with 12 and 11 points respectively.The Raptors were led by Terrence Ross, who came off the bench to score a team-high of 23 points (9-16 FG, 5-11 3Pt), while adding three rebounds. The 23 points were a new season-high for him, while the five three-pointers he made were also a season-high. Kyle Lowry was able to post a double-double, finishing with 13 points (5-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT), six rebounds and 10 assists. He's scored 13 points or less in four out of his last five games, as his points totals have gone down a bit lately. DeMar DeRozan recorded 13 points (5-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT), five rebounds and six assists in 34 minutes. He's now averaging 18.2 points and 4.2 rebounds on the year.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls 101-90 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston.The Rockets were the superior shooters in this one, going 41 percent from the field, while the Bulls went just 35 percent. The Bulls were able to out-rebound the Rockets 60-47 , but they were forced into 13 turnovers, compared to only six from the Rockets. The Bulls have now lost three straight.Like he's done all season, James Harden led the Rockets in this one, finishing with a team-high 27 points (9-20 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 6-6 FT), to go along with four assists and two blocked shots. He's now had two impressive games in a row, combining for 53 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists. Trevor Ariza was dialed in with his shot, going 7-for-10 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding five rebounds and two steals. He's combined to go 13-for-25 from the field and 6-for-12 from the three-point line over his last two games, as he'll look to continue with his hot shooting moving forward. Recording his second double-double in his last three games, Donatas Motiejunas posted 15 points (7-15 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. In those last three games he's averaging 20.7 points and 8.7 rebounds as he's turned it on a bit.Both Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose did everything they could to keep the Bulls in this game. Butler went 9-for-18 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to record 27 points, while also adding six rebounds. He's combined for 49 points and 13 rebounds over his last two games, pushing his season averages to 20.6 points and six rebounds per game. Rose on the other hand recorded 23 points (9-22 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 3-4 FT), four rebounds and two assists. It was his second straight night posting 23 points. Both Taj Gibson and Pau Gasol posted double-doubles. Gibson had 12 points (4-9 FG, 4-6 FT) and 10 rebounds, while Gasol finished with 16 points (5-10 FG, 6-7 FT) and 12 rebounds. Joakim Noah had an awful game offensively (0-8 FG, 0-1 3Pt), posting one point, but he did grab 19 rebounds as he was a force on the boards.  The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday, while the Bulls will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Saturday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (27-22) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (13-36) 113-105 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers shot just 42 percent from the floor and 32 percent from beyond the arc. Despite being out-rebounded 53-35, the Bucks forced the Lakers into 18 turnovers, while only committing 12 of their own.The Bucks had four players reach the 20-point mark in this game. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the team with 25 points (10-14 FG, 5-5 FT), while also adding six rebounds and two blocked shots. The 25 points were a new season-high for him and a nice surprise for the Bucks, as he's averaging only 11.4 points per game so far this season. Brandon Knight had a very solid performance as well, posting 24 points (7-17 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 6-6 FT), seven rebounds and eight assists in 36 minutes. He had a poor showing in Saturday's game against the Trail Blazers, going only 3-of-13 from the field, so it was good to see him have a better night shooting the ball. Khris Middleton came close to a triple-double, with 21 points (7-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 6-7 FT), seven rebounds and seven assists. He also did it on the defensive side of the ball with three steals, marking the fourth straight game with at least two steals. Coming off the bench, O.J. Mayo was the fourth member to reach the 20-point plateau, scoring 21 points (8-15 FG, 5-8 3Pt) in 33 minutes.Carlos Boozer had a huge outing off the bench for the Lakers, posting a game-high of 28 points, to go along with nine rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. He's played outstanding over his last three games, averaging 21.0 points and nine rebounds over that stretch. Leading the starters, Wayne Ellington found his stroke, scoring 19 points (7-17 FG, 5-12 3Pt) in 37 minutes. He had a very poor game against the Knicks on Sunday, so it was a nice bounce back showing for him. Also providing a bunch of production off the bench was Nick Young. Young went 5-for-12 from the field and 2-for-8 from the three-point line to score 16 points. He missed three games in a row with an ankle injury, so it was a positive sign for his ankle that he played 34 minutes. Robert Sacre added 10 points as the starting center.  The Bucks' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Friday, while the Lakers will travel to Orlando to play the Magic on Friday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (9-40) defeated the Miami Heat (21-28) 102-101 on Wednesday.Ricky Rubio played 23 minutes in his second game back from an ankle injury. He had been out since Nov. 7, but he finished with eight points, nine assists and four turnovers. Mo Williams had a double-double off the bench with 10 points and 10 assists. He too was in his second game back, after missing two games with a hip injury. Zach LaVine played eight minutes off the bench. He has an ankle injury and sat out Minnesota's previous two games. 2014 first-overall pick Andrew Wiggins had a rough game, posting just six points on 2-of-8 from the field to go along with five rebounds and four fouls in 37 minutes. Kevin Martin has come on strong since returning from a wrist injury that had kept him out since Nov. 19. He's put up averages of 20.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.0 steal in 35 minutes in five games since coming back. Martin scored 30 points on 11-of-23 from the field in 40 minutes against the Heat.Hassan Whiteside continued his 2015 breakout campaign Wednesday. He put up 24 points and 20 rebounds to go along with two blocks and three steals in 36 minutes. He led his team in points, rebounds, blocks, steals, minutes and turnovers. Norris Cole led the Heat's bench with 15 points in 26 minutes. He missed what would have been the game-winning three-point bucket with two seconds remaining in the game. Miami has lost four of their last five games. Their longest winning streak of the season is just two games, which they have done just twice this season.The Heat will head to San Antonio to face the Spurs on Friday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (25-24) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (26-23) 102-91 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Thunder shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 53 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Pelicans went just 39 percent from the floor and a meager 28 percent from beyond the arc. While the Thunder were down 57-51 at half, they had a huge second half where they out-scored the Pelicans 51-34, allowing them to steal a victory over the Pelicans. It was a big win, as they will be fighting against the Pelicans to secure one of the last spots in the Western Conference playoffs moving forward.With Kevin Durant still sitting out with a toe injury, Russell Westbrook again took it on himself to do the bulk of the work offensively for the Thunder. Westbrook went 18-for-31 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 45 points, while also adding six rebounds and six assists. It was his second 40-point outing in his last four games, a stretch where he's averaging 31.0 points, 6.8 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game. Serge Ibaka had a big game defensively, as he posted seven blocks, to go along with 13 points (6-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and six rebounds. Over his last two games, he's combined for 29 points, 14 rebounds and 10 blocks. Dion Waiters was in the starting lineup again with Durant out. He finished with 12 points (6-14 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 0-2 FT), six rebounds and two steals in 33 minutes. The only other Thunder player to reach double figures was Anthony Morrow, who had 14 points (6-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and four rebounds off the bench.The Pelicans got most of their production from Anthony Davis, who posted 23 points (9-21 FG, 5-6 FT) and eight rebounds in 39 minutes. He's continued to stay dominant over his last four games, averaging 27.0 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.3 blocks over that stretch. Giving Davis the most help was Ryan Anderson, who came off the bench to score 19 points (7-17 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT), to go along with five rebounds and two steals in 28 minutes. He's been the most reliable player off the bench for the Pelicans this season, so it was good to see him have another positive showing Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (31-18) beat the Orlando Magic (15-37) 110-103 on Wednesday.Tim Duncan dropped 26 points and 10 rebounds in 34 minutes. It was his sixth double-double since the beginning of January, and his second game of at least 20 and 10 in his last four. Manu Ginobli dished out 10 assists in 29 minutes. Boris Diaw was inserted into the starting lineup for Tiago Splitter, who sat out with an illness. It was Splitter's second game missed out of the Spurs' past three. San Antonio has turned it on as of late. They've only lost four games since the calendar turned to 2015 and haven't lost back-to-back games since Dec. 25 and 26.The Magic, on the other hand, are having a rough go so far in 2015. They inexplicably won consecutive games against the Bulls and Rockets on Jan. 12 and 14. Other than those two tilts, the Magic are winless this year. They have been getting strong performances from center Nikola Vucevic, who's been averaging 19.4 points and 12.2 rebounds over his past five games. However, he put up 25 points and 13 rebounds on the Spurs in Wednesday's losing effort. Tobias Harris also had a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds to go along with six assists. While all five Magic starters scored in double figures and avoided a negative plus-minus, the bench combined for just 17 points, and all five reserves had a negative plus/minus.The Magic will welcome the Los Angeles Lakers to the Amway Center on Friday, and the Spurs will stick around Florida for a rematch of the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals with the Miami Heat.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (37-12) defeated the Utah Jazz (17-32) 100-90 on Wednesday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.The Grizzlies got out quickly in this game, out-scoring the Jazz 30-23 in the first quarter, therefore setting the tone for the rest of the game. The Grizzlies shot the ball well, going 48 percent from the field and 46 percent from the three-point line, while the Jazz went 45 percent from the floor and just 30 percent from beyond the arc. The Grizzlies also forced the Jazz into 14 turnovers, while committing only nine of their own.The frontcourt did the bulk of the work for the Grizzlies, led by center Marc Gasol. Gasol went 9-for-18 from the field and 5-for-5 from the free throw line to score a game-high of 23 points, while also adding six rebounds and four assists. He had finished under his season scoring average in six straight games, so he finally got it going offensively and broke out for an improved performance. Zach Randolph had some success as well, finishing with 18 points (6-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT), 11 rebounds and four assists. Over his last three games he's averaging 19.3 points and 12.7 rebounds, as he continues to be a force for the surging Grizzlies, who've now won eight straight games. Mike Conley had his shot locked in, scoring 17 points (6-11 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and handing out two assists, moving his season averages to 17.3 points and 5.4 assists per game. Jeff Green recorded 13 points (4-8 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 20 minutes.Coming off the bench with the second unit, Trey Burke did most of the damage for the Jazz. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 21 points, while adding four assists in 30 minutes. Despite averaging 12.8 points on the season, Burke has now scored 15 or more points in each of his last three games. Recording a double-double, Enes Kanter finished with 16 points (8-18 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and 10 rebounds. It was the third time in his last four games that he recorded 10 or more rebounds. Gordon Hayward chipped in with 15 points (5-10 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds. Over his last three games he's averaging 22.7 points and eight rebounds as he continues to be one of the Jazz's best offensive options. Derrick Favors reached double figures as well with 11 points in 29 minutes.   The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday, while the Jazz will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Friday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Memphis,Grizzlies,Vivint Smart Home Arena,37,12,17,32,7.0,23.0,33.0,73.0,17.0,26.0,40.0,15.0,12.0,6.0,13.0,38.0,80.0,18.0,22.0,38.0,26.0,9.0,Gordon Hayward,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,34,Jeff Green,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,20,Derrick Favors,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Zach Randolph,11.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,33,Enes Kanter,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,31,Marc Gasol,6.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,23.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Joe Ingles,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,20,Courtney Lee,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,29,Dante Exum,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,24,Mike Conley,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,30,Rudy Gobert,6.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Tony Allen,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Trey Burke,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,30,Kosta Koufos,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Elijah Millsap,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,17,Beno Udrih,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,Trevor Booker,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10,Nick Calathes,1.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,21,Chris Johnson,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Jon Leuer,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10

												The Golden State Warriors (39-8) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (33-18) 128-114 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.Despite being out-scored 42-25 in the first quarter, the Warriors dominated the rest of the game, out-scoring the Mavericks 103-72 in the final three quarters. The Warriors shot extremely well, going 52 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Mavericks went 42 percent from the floor and 33 percent from beyond the arc.This game was all about Stephen Curry, who went 16-for-26 from the field and 10-for-16 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 51 points in 37 minutes. He was absolutely unstoppable, shooting an incredible 62 percent from the field and 63 percent from the three-point line. This marked his fourth straight game scoring 23 or more points. While in the shadow of Curry's huge night, Klay Thompson still had some strong numbers, finishing with 18 points (7-17 FG, 4-10 3Pt), five assists and two steals. While it was slightly less than his season scoring average, he just didn't have to do that much, as Curry just wouldn't cool off. The Warriors did receive some help from their bench though, as both Marreese Speights and Leandro Barbosa reached double figures in points. Speights finished with 14 points (5-10 FG, 4-4 FT) and six rebounds, while Barbosa had 14 points (5-8 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and three rebounds.   Despite suffering the loss, the Mavericks did have six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Chandler Parsons led the way, posting 24 points (9-18 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-9 FT), four rebounds and four assists. He's recorded four impressive games in a row, averaging 20.5 points and 3.8 rebounds over that stretch. Tyson Chandler had a pretty big game, finishing with 21 points (8-9 FG, 5-6 FT) and 17 rebounds. After posting only six points in Monday's game against the Timberwolves, it was good to see him explode on the offensive side of the ball with a positive result. While it wasn't his best day shooting the ball, Dirk Nowitzki still posted 15 points (4-15 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and three rebounds. Monta Ellis had only 14 points (7-19 FG, 0-4 3Pt) in 38 minutes, despite being the scoring leader for this team.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Mavericks will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings on Thursday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (11-39) defeated the Denver Nuggets (19-30) 105-98 on Tuesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.The Sixers caught fire real quick in this game, out-scoring the Nuggets 61-40 in the first half alone. With such a huge lead at half, they were able to coast to a  seven-point victory, despite a fourth quarter run by the Nuggets, as they out-scored the Sixers 30-20 to finish the game. The Sixers were the superior shooters in this game, going 44 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Nuggets finished 39 percent from the floor and 39 percent from beyond the arc.The storyline for the Sixers in this game was the play of Hollis Thompson off the bench. Thompson went 8-for-12 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 23 points, while also adding three assists and two blocked shots. The 23 points were a new season-high for him and also the third straight game scoring in double figures, despite averaging only 7.4 points per game so far this season. After leaving Monday's game with both a bruised shin and a sprained left ankle, Michael Carter-Williams made a suprise start. In 33 minutes, Carter-Williams recorded a double-double, finishing with 15 points (4-12 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-10 FT), eight rebounds and 12 assists. Many thought he would be on a minutes restriction due to his injuries on Monday, but that wasn't the case, so they must not be as serious as originally thought. Robert Covington had a strong showing as well with 17 points (4-12 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and eight rebounds in 29 minutes.  It was his second straight impressive performance, combining for 33 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and nine steals in those two games.The Nuggets were also led by a bench player, as Danilo Gallinari scored a team-high of 22 points (5-11 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 10-11 FT), while also adding four rebounds in 26 minutes. It was his second night in a row with more than 10 field goal attempts, despite doing that only one other time this season, which in turn increased his point totals. Wilson Chandler also had an impressive night shooting the ball. He went 7-for-15 from the field and 5-for-10 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while adding six rebounds in only 25 minutes. He had scored 10 or less points in each of his last three games, so it was good to see him return to form. The only other starter to reach double figures in scoring was Arron Afflalo, as he finished with 14 points (5-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 29 minutes. Ty Lawson had only five points (1-4 FG, 3-4 FT), but did have a game-high of 14 assists.  The Sixers' next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Friday, while the Nuggets will travel to Boston to play the Celtics on Wednesday.

												The Detroit Pistons (19-30) picked up the win over the Miami Heat (21-27) 108-91 on Tuesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills. D.J Augustin's resurgence continued Tuesday as he lit Miami up for 25 points and 13 assists to help the Pistons to their 19th win on the season. Not only did Augustin record his second straight double-double, he did so without committing a single turnover. Detroit built a comfortable lead in the early going and withstood a 21-point outburst from Chris Bosh in the third quarter to secure its second straight win. Miami is one of the East's better road teams and was 13-11 away from home entering Tuesday's tilt, but was unable to notch a win against a rested Detroit club. Chris Bosh erupted for 34 points, with 21 of them coming in a 9-for-9 shooting performance in the third quarter. Hassan Whiteside had 11 points and 10 rebounds to notch his fourth double-double in five games. He also added five blocks in the contest. Miami will finish up its back-to-back set Wednesday in Minnesota. Detroit's win puts the Pistons two 2.5 games out of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Point guard John Lucas III, who was signed to a 10-day contract just a couple days ago, saw his first NBA minutes since Oct. 22. Lucas had three points, one rebound, and one assist in six minutes of action. The Pistons will face the Pacers on Wednesday in Indiana.

												The Boston Celtics (17-30) defeated the New York Knicks (10-39) 108-97 on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Celtics got out to a quick lead in this matchup, going up 57-44 by halftime. The Knicks made a run in the third quarter, but couldn't continue it in the fourth, as the Celtics stole the 11-point victory on the road. The Celtics were the better shooters in this game, going 55 percent from the field, while the Knicks shot just 49 percent. The Celtics also out-rebounded the Knicks 39-35, even furthering their advantage Tuesday.Already the two scoring leaders for the Celtics this season, both Jared Sullinger and Avery Bradley did the most damage in this game. Bradley went an impressive 11-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 26 points, while also adding four assists. He's had a decent two-game stretch, combining for 43 points, six assists and three steals. Sullinger on the other hand nearly double-doubled, recording 22 points (11-19 FG, 0-3 3Pt), nine rebounds and six assists. He had a poor showing in Sunday's game against the Heat, so it was good to see him get back on track Tuesday. Replacing Tyler Zeller as the starting center, Brandon Bass finished with 12 points and four rebounds in 30 minutes. Over his last three games he's averaged 14.7 points and six rebounds, so we'll see if his play continues to improve with more time in the starting lineup. Despite temporarily leaving the game with an injury, Marcus Smart returned and posted 13 points (3-9 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and three assists in 37 minutes.Carmelo Anthony did everything he could to keep the Knicks in this game, going for 21 points (9-23 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), six rebounds and a steal. He's now combined for 52 points and 14 rebounds over his last two games, as he continues to be the team scoring leader. Jose Calderon shot very well, going 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to record 17 points. It was a nice surprise for the Knicks, as he's averaging only nine points per game on the season. Despite the loss, the Knicks also saw some decent production from the bench with both Tim Hardaway Jr and Lance Thomas finishing in double figures. Hardaway Jr had 14 points (5-11 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and two assists in 23 minutes, while Thomas posted 11 points (4-7 FG, 3-4 FT) and two assists in 25 minutes.The Celtics' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday, while the Knicks will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Friday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (33-16) narrowly avoided their fourth straight loss Tuesday, holding off a late charge from Utah to defeat the Jazz (17-31) 103-102.Portland had lost eight of its last ten games, including an 0-3 road trip last week, coming into Tuesday's contest and was desperate for a win. Utah hung tough with Portland and made things very interesting when Joe Ingles' three pointer brought the Jazz within two points with just under 10 seconds to go in the game. However, LaMarcus Aldridge's free throws put the game out of reach for the Jazz as Portland notched a much-needed win. Utah has been a thorn in the side for the West's top teams of late, coming within five points of the Clippers and securing a surprising win over Golden State last week. Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Dante Exum started at point guard again, but only logged 20 minutes on the floor and was held scoreless while Trey Burke put up 18 points in 34 minutes. Utah gets another top team in the West on Wednesday when Memphis comes to town. Portland's recent struggles have affected its playoff standing, but the Trail Blazers were able to pull off a victory to temporarily stop the bleeding. The Trail Blazers are one of four teams in the Western Conference with 33 wins now and need to right the ship if they want to keep their standing in the top four. Robin Lopez returned to the floor for the first time since mid-December and contributed 11 points and six rebounds. He suffered a facial laceration in the third quarter, but was able to return to the game. Portland is idle Wednesday before hosting Phoenix on Thursday.

												The Golden State Warriors (38-8) defeated the Sacramento Kings (17-30) 121-96 on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.The Warriors got off to a very quick start in this game, out-scoring the Kings 63-42 in the first half alone. With such a big lead, they were able to coast through the second half and secure the 25-point victory. The Warriors were impressive as a team shooting the ball, going 51 percent from the field, while the Kings went just 44 percent. The Warriors also out-rebounded them 49-34, even furthering their advantage.Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson were the only starters to reach double figures in points for the Warriors. Curry finished with 23 points (6-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 9-10 FT), nine assists and three steals, while Thompson had 14 points (6-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and one assist. With such a large lead, none of the Warriors' starters played over 30 minutes. With added playing time for the reserves, they showed a lot of production as well. Andre Iguodala was very successful, going 6-for-8 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 17 points in 24 minutes. While he's averaging only 6.9 points per game on the season, this was his second straight game in double figures, combining for 29 points over that span. Marreese Speights added 17 points (8-13 FG, 1-2 FT) of his own, to go along with eight rebounds and three assists. He struggled to only five points in Friday's game against the Jazz, so it was a nice bounce back game for him.Despite the loss, DeMarcus Cousins was again one of the most dominant players in the game. In 41 minutes, he finished with a game-high of 26 points (10-21 FG, 6-7 FT), while also posting 11 rebounds, four assists, three steals and four blocked shots. He stuffed the stat sheet in this game, but it still was not enough to push the Kings to a victory. It also marked his third double-double in as many games. Rudy Gay also had a strong showing, scoring 20 points (7-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and grabbing three rebounds in 37 minutes. He's turned it up over his last two games, combining for 51 points and eight rebounds over that span. Both Darren Collison and Ben McLemore reached double-digits in points as well.

												The Charlotte Hornets (21-27) defeated the Washington Wizards (31-18) 92-88 on Monday at the Verizon Center in Washington. This ended up being a very evenly played game between the two Eastern Conference teams. The Hornets were the superior shooters in this game though, going 47 percent from the field, while the Wizards shot just 41 percent from the floor. The Wizards did take the advantage from the free throw line though, making 16-of-19 attempts, while the Hornets converted on 14-of-19.The Hornets were led by Al Jefferson in this game, who went 9-for-19 from the floor to score 18 points, while also recording 12 rebounds and two steals. It was the second time in the last three games he's posted a double-double, while the two steals matched a season-high for the center. Continuing to replace Kemba Walker in the starting lineup, Brian Roberts had a solid showing, contributing 18 points (6-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and three assists in 34 minutes. After going scoreless in Saturday's game against the Denver Nuggets, it was a nice bounce back game for him. Gerald Henderson had a nice showing from the floor, finishing with 17 points (6-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five assists. In his last three games he's now averaged 14.2 points. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added a double-double with 13 points (4-6 FG, 5-10 FT) and 13 rebounds as well. As expected, the Wizards got most of their production from their backcourt duo of Bradley Beal and John Wall. Each recorded a double-double, as Beal had 18 points (7-16 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 11 rebounds, while Wall posted 16 points (4-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 7-7 FT) and 10 assists. Beal has turned it on over his last two games, combining for 44 points and 14 rebounds. He's now averaging 15.1 points and 3.7 rebounds on the season. This double-double marked the second in a row for Wall, who's combined for 44 points and 22 asssists over his last two games. While both the guards had solid showings, they didn't get enough help from their supporting cast. Coming off the bench, Kris Humphries was the only bench player to reach double figures, finishing with 13 points (4-8 FG, 5-6 FT) and five rebounds in 25 minutes.   The Hornets' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards again on Thursday, while the Wizards will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Wednesday, before heading to Charlotte to play the Hornets again on Thursday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (19-28) took down the Los Angeles Clippers (33-16) 102-100 on Monday.Deron Williams made his return to the Nets' rotation. He missed the last 11 games with a rib injury. The Nets went 2-9 in that stretch, but still remain a threat to grab a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Williams scored 15 points in 29 minutes to help give his squad the win over a very good Clippers team that went 11-4 in the month of January. Joe Johnson also returned to the Nets after missing Sunday's practice for personal reasons. Johnson scored 22 points to go along with five rebounds and six assists.DeAndre Jordan recorded 22 points (10-13 FG, 2-12 FT) and 20 rebounds, his fourth game of the season with 20 rebounds or more. J.J. Reddick left the game with back spasms after playing just four minutes and didn't return. The Los Angeles had a 90-79 lead with 5:16 remaining, but couldn't hold on as the Nets ended the game on a 23-10 run. Chris Paul hit a big layup with eight seconds remaining to tie the game at 100.  Brooklyn's Jarrett Jack answered with a 17-foot jumper with one second left on the clock. The Clippers failed to get a shot off, and the Nets were victorious at home.The Nets will play the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, and the Clippers will take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (26-22) defeated the Toronto Raptors (33-16) 82-75 on Monday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. Coming out of the third quarter, the Bucks had built a 73-60 lead and looked to be on the verge of coasting to an easy win. The Raptors made a run in the fourth quarter though, out-scoring the Bucks 15-9, but their comeback came up just short, as the Bucks secured the seven-point victory and ended the Raptors win streak at six. The Bucks were the superior shooters in this matchup, going 41 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors went just 32 percent from the floor and a meager 26 percent from beyond the arc. Khris Middleton led the Bucks with a very impressive performance Monday. He went 10-for-17 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 25 points, while also adding nine rebounds and three steals. With Brandon Knight sitting out due to a quad injury and Jorge Gutierrez going scoreless as his replacement in the starting lineup, Middleton took it on himself to keep the Bucks moving forward, and was the biggest reason for the Bucks' success. Giannis Antetokounmpo added a double-double, finishing with 12 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-8 FT) and 12 rebounds. It was his second double-double in a row, as he's combined for 22 points and 22 rebounds over those two outings. Also reaching double figures in points was Jared Dudley, who scored 14 points (5-12 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and handed out five assists. He's had a nice stretch of three games where he's averaging 16.3 points. John Henson also pitched in with 12 points (5-8 FG, 2-2 FT) and four rebounds. In limited playing time, DeMar DeRozan did everything he could to keep the Raptors alive in this game, finishing with 16 points (5-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and two assists in only 25 minutes. He's averaging 19.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 6.0 assists over his last three games. Kyle Lowry really struggled with his shot Monday, while he also was dealing with a tight hamstring, which forced him from the game in the first quarter before returning in the second . He went only 1-for-7 from the field and 0-for-2 from the three-point line to score two points in 29 minutes. Recording a double-double, Jonas Valanciunas recorded 12 points (6-9 FG) and 13 rebounds in 25 minutes. He was dealing with an ankle injury during Saturday's win over the Wizards and played only 17 minutes in that game, so it was good to see get some extended time on the court. The Raptors did see some contribution from their bench, with both Louis Williams and Terrence Ross reaching double figures in points. Williams had 12 points (1-12 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 9-10 FT) and one rebound, while Ross finished with 10 points (4-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and four rebounds.  The Bucks' next game will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, while the Raptors will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (26-22) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (40-9) 115-110 on Monday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. Looking to extend their winning streak to 20 games Monday, the Hawks came out of this game dissapointed, as the Pelicans stepped up and took an impressive 15-point victory. The Pelicans shot pretty well, going 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line, while the Hawks went 45 percent from the floor and 32 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans were also able to finish with a 52-32 rebounding advantage, giving them a huge upperhand and contributing even further to the win.As he's done all season long, Anthony Davis continued to show himself as one of the best players in the league. In 34 minutes, he finished with 29 points (12-23 FG, 5-7 FT), 13 rebounds and and two blocked shots. It was his fifth double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 26.8 points, 11.4 rebounds and two blocks per game. Eric Gordon had a really strong showing as well, going 7-for-11 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding seven assists in 28 minutes. It was his second impressive game in a row, as he's combined for 48 points and 14 assists over those two matchups. Recording a double-double of his own, Tyreke Evans added 15 points (7-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt), five rebounds and 12 assists. He's recorded exactly 12 assists in four out of his last five games. The Pelicans had a huge effort off the bench as well. Ryan Anderson recorded 15 points (5-10 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and six rebounds, while Jimmer Fredette added 10 points (3-6 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and three assists. The Hawks saw their biggest contribution from Jeff Teague, who had a team-high of 21 points (8-17 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-5 FT), while also adding seven assists. He had an ugly showing in Saturday's game against Philadelphia, where he went just 3-of-12 from the field, so it was good to see him hit his shot more consistently Monday. Paul Millsap also did as much as he could to keep the Hawks alive, finishing with 15 points (5-14 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), six rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now averaging 17.2 points and eight rebounds per game so far this season. Kent Bazemore continued to start at small forward with DeMare Carroll playing limited action off the bench due to general soreness in his body. Bazemore finished with nine points (4-9 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-3 FT) and three rebounds in 26 minutes. Both Kyle Korver and Dennis Schroder reached double figures as well, scoring 12 and 10 points respectively.   The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, while the Hawks will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Atlanta,Hawks,Smoothie King Center,40,9,26,22,9.0,23.0,43.0,86.0,20.0,23.0,52.0,30.0,13.0,7.0,22.0,38.0,87.0,13.0,17.0,31.0,19.0,6.0,Dante Cunningham,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Kent Bazemore,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,26,Anthony Davis,13.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,29.0,12.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Paul Millsap,6.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,32,Omer Asik,17.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Al Horford,9.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30,Eric Gordon,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,7.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,28,Kyle Korver,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,29,Tyreke Evans,5.0,12.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,31,Jeff Teague,2.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,17.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,29,Quincy Pondexter,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,30,Pero Antic,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Ryan Anderson,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,28,DeMarre Carroll,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,23,Jimmer Fredette,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,20,Dennis Schroder,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,18,John Salmons,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,7,Mike Scott,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,22,Jeff Withey,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,John Jenkins,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (24-24) defeated the Orlando Magic (15-36) 104-97 on Monday.Russell Westbrook had another big game. He recorded his second triple-double of the season with 25 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds. The Thunder needed a big performance from him, as Kevin Durant (toe) sat out. It was Durant's third time sitting out in the last four games. Dion Waiters had his best game as a member of the Thunder, scoring 24 points in 41 minutes. His previous high with Oklahoma City was 21 points against the Warriors back on Jan. 16. After the win, the Thunder are still on the outside looking in at the Western Conference playoff picture.Victor Oladipo returned to the Magic starting lineup after missing Saturday's contest due to a sore right Achilles. He led the Magic with 22 points to go along with seven rebounds, four assists and one steal in 34 minutes. Orlando has now lost nine straight, and are seven and a half games back of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.The Magic will take their losing streak to San Antonio on Wednesday, and the Thunder will head to the Smoothie King Center to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (32-17) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (8-39) 100-94 on Monday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The Mavericks came out and had a strong start in this one, out-scoring the Timberwolves 30-20 in the first quarter alone. The Mavericks shot better as a team, going 46 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three-point line, while the Wolves went 42 percent from the floor and a meager 23 percent from beyond the arc. The Timberwolves did secure a 47-43 rebounding advantage, but it wasn't enough to take down the Mavericks. Monta Ellis had the most production for the Mavericks, finishing with 23 points (7-21 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 6-11 FT), two assists and two steals in 36 minutes. He's had two impressive games in a row, combining for 48 points, 15 assists and five steals over that span. Chandler Parsons was also extremely effective, as he had his shot dialed in. He went 8-for-12 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and four steals. The four steals were a new season-high for him, as he was productive on both sides of the ball Monday. Dirk Nowitzki was very efficient in his time on the floor, scoring 16 points (7-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and grabbing seven rebounds. He's scored 14 points or less in each of his last four games, so it was good to see him start trending back towards his season-average of 18.3 points per game. Starting in place of Rajon Rondo, Jose Barea added 10 points (4-14 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and eight assists. In his fourth game back since returning from his lengthy wrist injury, Kevin Martin scored a team-high of 19 points (8-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 38 minutes. During those four games he's averaged 18.3 points, so he's nearing a return to the form he was in before the injury. Thaddeus Young nearly recorded a double-double, posting 15 points (5-10 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 5-6 FT), nine rebounds and three steals. He's turned it on during his last two games, combining for 34 points and 12 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins didn't necessarily have his best showing from the field, finishing only 4-of-14 from the floor to score 14 points. He just posted 33 points on Saturday, so it was somewhat of a letdown for him. The biggest storyline of the night for the Timberwolves though was the return of Ricky Rubio. He moved right back into the starting lineup and posted 10 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT), three rebounds and four assists in only 21 minutes. It was expected he'd be on a minutes restriction, so it's no surprise he played such a small portion of time. Mo Williams added 15 points (3-7 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 7-7 FT) and five assists off the bench as well. The Mavericks' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (36-12) pulled out a victory over the Phoenix Suns (28-22) on Monday.Marc Gasol continued his stellar season, showing off his spectacular passing ability from the center position. He finished with 15 points, six rebounds, three blocks and eight assists. He has averaged five assists over his past five games, while shooting 91 percent from the free throw line during that stretch, which isn't an easy feat for one of the game's few true centers. The Grizzlies are now 11-1 over their last 12 games, and only have one game against an opponent with a record better than .500 before the All-Star break.Isaiah Thomas led the Suns in scoring, putting up 24 points to give Phoenix a spark off the bench. Eric Bledsoe turned in a good game with 21 points, seven rebounds, eight assists, four steals and two blocks. He hit two free throws to give the Suns a 98-91 lead with 3:31 remaining in the game. Memphis' Zach Randolph went on to score five points in the final 2:33 to give his team a fighting chance. Jeff Green then hit a bucket, was fouled in the process with four seconds left, and went on to make the free throw to give the Grizzlies a lead and a 102-101 victory.The Grizzlies will play the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, and the Suns will head to the Moda Center to face the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday.

												The Miami Heat (21-26) defeated the Boston Celtics (16-30) 83-75 on Sunday at the TD Garden in Boston.The Heat got off to a strong start in this one, out-scoring the Celtics 44-31 in the first half alone. They were superior shooters in this game, going 42 percent from the field, while the Celtics went just 37 percent from the floor. The Heat also secured a 46-40 rebounding advantage.For the Heat, Hassan Whiteside just kept on going Sunday, recording another impressive performance. In 29 minutes, Whiteside finished with 20 points (10-17 FG), nine rebounds and three blocks. He came just one rebound shy of notching his fourth double-double in a row, a stretch where he's averaging 16.5 points, 15.5 rebounds and four blocks over those four games. Chris Bosh also had a solid showing, posting 18 points (6-19 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 5-7 FT), seven rebounds and two assists. It wasn't his best day shooting the ball, but he still did enough to help secure the victory, even with both Dwyane Wade (hamstring) and Luol Deng (calf) sitting out with injuries. Coming off the bench, Tyler Johnson was the only other player in double figures, fininshing with 13 points (4-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-6 FT), nine rebounds, four assists and two steals in 27 minutes. This was only his third game of the season, while the points, rebounds and assists were all season-highs for the rookie.The Celtics saw their biggest production from the duo of Avery Bradley and Tyler Zeller. Bradley finished with 17 points (8-15 FG, 1-4 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists, while Zeller had 17 points (6-13 FG, 5-8 FT), six rebounds and four assists. Bradley shot a combined 8-for-27 from the field over his last two games, so it was good to see him shoot the ball a little better on Sunday. Zeller is only averaging 9.3 points per game so far this season, so his points totals were a nice surprise for the Celtics, despite the loss. The only other Celtic to reach double figures in points was Brandon Bass, who went 7-for-14 from the field to record 15 points, while also adding six rebounds and two blocked shots. He's started to heat up, as he's combined for 32 points and 14 rebounds over his last two games.The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, while the Celtics will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Tuesday.

												The New York Knicks (10-38) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (13-35) 92-80 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Knicks came out blazing Sunday, out-scoring the Lakers 32-19 in the first quarter, therefore setting the tone for the rest of the game. The Knicks were much better shooting in this game, going 44 percent from the field and 46 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers went just 36 percent from the floor and 44 percent from beyond the arc. The Lakers were forced into 15 turnovers, which also may have made a big difference Sunday.Carmelo Anthony did the bullk of the work for the Knicks, going 13-for-25 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 31 points, while also adding eight rebounds, two assists and a steal. He had a very strong stretch of games to finish out the late stages of January, and it looks to have carried over to February. He's now scored 24 points or more in six out of his last seven games, pushing his season average up to 24.1 points per game. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was rookie Langston Galloway, who finished with 13 points (4-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and five rebounds in 29 minutes. He struggled to only four points on Thursday, so it was good to see him turn things around again. Lou Amundson didn't do much offensively with just six points, but he did clean up the boards, grabbing 13 rebounds in his start at forward.The Lakers saw a big game from their rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson, who went 6-for-13 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also adding three rebounds and two steals. It was his third impressive game in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 18.3 points per game. While the rest of the starters combined for only 16 points, the bench did provide some decent contributions. Carlos Boozer led the bench with 19 points (6-15 FG, 7-8 FT) and 10 rebounds in only 24 minutes. The double-double marked his eigth of the season. Wesley Johnson also continued to come off the bench, and finished with 11 points (4-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and five rebounds. It was his second game in a row without being a part of the starting lineup, as Ryan Kelly has been replacing him as the starting forward. The bench out-scored the starters with a combined 45 points.The Knicks' next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday, while the Lakers will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Wednesday.

												The Sacramento Kings (17-29) defeated the Indiana Pacers (17-32) 99-94 Saturday at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Although the Kings were playing for the second night in a row, Sacramento took control early with a 19-2 run to take a  30-12 with under two minutes to go in the first. However, Indiana stormed back in the fourth quarter with a run of its own to cut into Sacramento's lead. The Pacers didn't have an answer for DeMarcus Cousins, though, as Cousins ended up with 20 points and 19 rebounds before fouling out late in the fourth. Sacramento's eight-game losing streak finally came to an end Saturday thanks to huge performances from Cousins and Rudy Gay. Rudy Gay led all scoreers with 31 points, which was his tenth 20-point outing of January. The Kings made 26 of their 29 free throw attempts to help ice the game. Sacramento has two days off before hosting Golden State on Tuesday. Indiana cruised to an easy 103-82 victory over New York on Friday, but was unable to have a repeat performance Saturday against Sacramento. The Pacers were hindered by poor outside shooting, going just 5-for-25 from beyond the arc. C.J Miles was responsible for eight of those misses from deep. Luis Scola returned to the rotation after being rested Friday and contributed 13 points and five rebounds off the bench. Indiana is off until Wednesday when it hosts Detroit.

												The Dallas Mavericks (32-17) defeated the Orlando Magic (15-35), 108-93. Both starting point guards, Rajon Rondo and Elfrid Payton, suffered game-ending injuries. Rondo played two minutes before receiving a Richard Jefferson knee to the head. Payton was slightly nudged from behind on a dunk attempt, landing awkwardly and was held out the rest of the contest.Victor Oladipo was unable to compete because of an Achilles issue. Evan Fournier started in his place, and joining him was Tobias Harris who replaced Channing Frye in the starting lineup. Thrust into primary ballhandling duty after the Elfrid Payton injury, seldom used Willie Green propelled the team into a competitive game by scoring nine of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Ben Gordon was ejected for cursing at an official, and Nikola Vucevic earned his 29th double-double, second only to Paul Gasol.For the second straight game, Chandler Parsons didn't play due to illness. The Mavericks pushed ahead by as many as 27 points, leading 66-41 at halftime. Monta Ellis recorded 13 assists in Rajon Rondo's absence, piling in 25 points as well. The Magic begins a two-game road trip against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday, and the Mavericks host the Minnesota Timberwolves after an off day.

												The Charlotte Hornets (20-27) defeated the Denver Nuggets (19-29) 104-86 on Saturday at the Pepsi Center. Charlotte was coming off two days rest and was able to easily defeat a Denver club that had lost eight of its last nine games coming into Saturday. The Hornets held the Nuggets to just 15 first quarter points as they jumped out to a 30-15 lead. Charlotte's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had a double-double with 17 points and 13 rebounds. The Hornets are 7-3 in their last ten games and have pulled to just a half game behind the Heat for the seventh seed in the East. Charlotte was missing Bismack Biyombo and Marvin Williams, but that didn't matter as it made quick work of Denver. The Hornets begin a home-and-home set with the Wizards on Monday. Denver's struggles continued Saturday as its playoff hopes continue to dwindle after sitting at 18-20 with a chance at the eighth seed earlier this month. Danilo Gallinari joined the starting lineup after Kenneth Faried and Darrell Arthur were both sidelined. Gallinari finished with 15 points and four rebounds in 23 minutes. Denver will return to action Tuesday in Philadelphia.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (33-15) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (30-18) 105-85 Saturday at the AT&T Center. Los Angeles finished its back-to-back set with a strong road victory against a rested San Antonio club. Blake Griffin had a huge game with 31 points and 13 rebounds while DeAndre Jordan had eight points and 19 rebounds. San Antonio had its three-game win streak snapped Saturday and currently holds the seventh seed in the Western Conference. The Clippers bounced back nicely after losing to a Pelicans team Friday that was without super star Anthony Davis. Austin Rivers saw 18 minutes of playing time and contributed 11 points and two rebounds. The Clippers are now 2.5 games behind the Grizzlies for the second seed in the West. Los Angeles will return to action Monday in Brooklyn. San Antonio came into this game on two days rest, but was unable to withstand a barrage from Los Angeles. Tiago Splitter moved into the starting lineup for Matt Bonner, but only had eight points and one rebound over 17 minutes. Kawhi Leonard hit four three-pointers on his was to a team-high 24 points. The Spurs are idle until Wednesday when they host the Magic.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (10-37) notched their 10th win of the season Friday, knocking off the Minnesota Timberwolves (8-38) 103-94 at the Wells Fargo Center.After starting the season 0-17, Philadelphia has played much better of late and has gone 10-20 over its last 30 games. While its record in that span may not jump off the page, the emergence of its young players has been encouraging. Michael Carter-Williams had his third triple-double of the season Friday, putting up 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Carter-Williams is now tied with Rajon Rondo for the league lead in triple-doubles. In addition, the 76ers had 16 fast break points, compared to just five such points for the Timberwolves. Minnesota was unable to close the gap late with some poor shooting and a poor defensive effort. There were some bright spots for the Timberwolves, however. Kevin Martin, in his second game back from a wrist injury, had 19 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. Nikola Pekovic looked strong as well, putting up 18 points and seven rebounds. The Timberwolves will play the second half of a back-to-back set Saturday when they host the Cavaliers. Philadelphia scored over 100 points for the first time since a Dec. 13 overtime loss to Memphis. Nerlens Noel continued to be a defensive force Friday, recording six blocks to go along with 14 points and six rebounds. Friday's win was just the third time this season Philadelphia has strung together consecutive wins. Philadelphia will wrap up its back-to-back set Saturday in Atlanta.

												The Atlanta Hawks (39-8) passed one of the toughest tests they've gotten during their remarkable 18-game winning streak, fending off the Portland Trail Blazers (32-15) 105-99 Friday at the Philips Arena.When it appeared that Portland was storming back, Atlanta got a huge contribution from an unlikely source. Up by just one point with momentum swinging in Portland's direction, Mike Scott buried a three-pointer to give Atlanta a four point lead. From that point on, Atlanta allowed just eight points in the last 4:11 of the fourth quarter to capture its 12th straight win over a Western Conference opponent.Portland has now dropped the first two games of a quick Eastern Conference road trip after coming up short Friday in Atlanta. LaMarcus Aldridge nearly willed his team to victory with his 37 point, 11 rebound performance against the Hawks. Portland's shooting faltered down the stretch, however, and the Trail Blazers were unable to close the gap. The Trail Blazers will try salvage their road-trip Saturday in Milwaukee. Atlanta entered the game without its usual starting forward, DeMarre Carroll, who was sidelined with soreness. His replacement, Thabo Sefolosha, had to leave the game in the first quarter with a calf strain and did not return.

												The Houston Rockets (33-14) defeated the Boston Celtics (16-29) 93-87 on Friday.Donatas Motiejunas stepped his game up in Dwight Howard's absence. Motiejunas had season highs of 26 points and 12 rebounds. The Rockets were in control for most of the game, and at one point led the Celtics by 19 points in the second quarter. However, a nine-point third quarter from the Rockets would give Boston a fighting chance. Marcus Thornton hit a shot to shorten the Houston lead to just three points with 27 seconds remaining. James Harden and Corey Brewer would go on to hit 3-of-4 free throws to seal the victory for the Rockets.The Celtics got another lightning-rod performance from Marcus Thornton. He led the bench attack for the second-straight game. Thornton scored 17 points in 23 minutes on Friday, after putting up 15 points in 14 minutes against the Timberwolves on Wednesday. Boston is now 3-6 over their last nine games, including three-straight losses at home. The Rockets have now won four straight and will play the Pistons in Detroit on Saturday. The Celtics will host the Miami Heat on Sunday.

												The Toronto Raptors (32-15) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (18-28) 127-122 in double overtime on Friday. Toronto went through a rough patch early in January, but they've collected five straight wins to help right the ship. The improved play of DeMar DeRozan over the last week has been the most obvious improvement seen from the Raptors, and it was DeRozan who led the Raptors on Friday, putting up a team-high 26 points and nine assists in 41 minutes. While they hold the distinguished position of being in second place in the Eastern Conference standings, the Raptors are also a wide birth of 7.5 games behind the conference-leading Atlanta Hawks. Brooklyn has dropped four straight games, and they've only won three games in January as they continue to fall out of the playoff conversation. Jarrett Jack put up a fight Friday, scoring a game-high 35 points, but the Nets continue to struggle with Deron Williams (ribs) missing the last 10 games, and while Williams appears close to returning, there's no target date that has been released to the public. Brook Lopez took advantage of getting 40 minutes off the bench for Brooklyn on Friday and matched Jack's game high with 35 points of his own. Jack also handed out 13 assists, and Lopez pulled down 12 rebounds, but their combined effort couldn't get them over the hump against the Raptors. Toronto will continue their road trip against the Washington Wizards on Saturday. The Nets will host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (28-20) defeated the Sacramento Kings (16-29) 101-90 on Friday.Cleveland went into beast mode in the middle of January. They've rattled off nine straight wins to adequately squelch any erroneous chatter about coach David Blatt being on the hot seat. LeBron James returned from a one-game absence Friday after having sat out Wednesday's 99-94 win over the Portland Trail Blazers with a wrist injury. James put up 19 points, seven assists, four steals and two blocks in 33 minutes, putting to rest most injury concerns regarding his wrist. Kevin Love rebounded from a poor 3-for-15 shooting performance Wednesday to put a game-high 23 points and 10 rebounds in 29 minutes. The Cavaliers are in fifth place in the Eastern Conference standings, 11.5 games behind the conference-leading Atlanta Hawks.Sacramento has lost eight straight games as their playoff chances continue to sputter and die. Even with another two and a half months of the regular season, the Kings sit 10 games behind the Suns for the final playoff spot, and between the Kings and Suns sit two playoff-worthy teams in the Thunder and Pelicans. DeMarcus Cousins was named as an injury replacement for Kobe Bryant (shoulder) on Friday for the All-Star Game, and he celebrated with 21 points, 13 rebounds and five steals. Omri Casspi chipped in 15 points off the bench to help, but the Kings were no match for the ascending Cavaliers.The Cavaliers will go on the road to face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday. The Kings will finish up their four-game road trip against the Indiana Pacers on Saturday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (25-22) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (32-15) 108-103 on Friday.New Orleans didn't let the absence of Anthony Davis (adductor) slow them down. They've won five of their last six games, and Eric Gordon stepped up Friday, putting up a game-high 28 points in 38 minutes. As has happened often when Davis is out of the lineup, Alexis Ajinca had a nice game off the bench, putting up 17 points and nine rebounds in 24 minutes, and Ryan Anderson moved into the starting lineup to put up 24 points and nine rebounds. The Pelicans are two games out of the final playoff spot in the West, just behind the Phoenix Suns.Los Angeles saw their six-game winning streak come to an end. Six players scored in double digits, and J.J. Redick returned from a one-game absence due to back spasms to put up 12 points and four assists in 28 minutes, but it wasn't enough to hold back the Pelicans. With Redick back in action, Jamal Crawford returned to a bench role and put up 15 points and one rebound in 28 minutes. Chris Paul approached a double-double and put on display his All-Star pedigree with a team-high 24 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in 38 minutes. The Clippers are tied with the Portland Trail Blazers for fifth place in the Western Conference standings, six games behind the conference-leading Golden State Warriors. The Pelicans will host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday. The Clippers are in the midst of an eight-game road trip that will see them play the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (31-17) beat the Miami Heat (20-26) 93-72 on Friday.Charlie Villanueva led the Mavericks in scoring with 20 points in 23 minutes off the bench to go along with a +29 plus/minus. He scored 10 points in the fourth quarter as part of a 33-12 final period against the Heat. Richard Jefferson started for Chandler Parsons, who was out with an illness. Jefferson played 21 minutes and finished with seven points. No starter scored more than 12 points for the Mavs who had dropped four straight games coming in to Friday.The game was tied 60-60 going into the fourth quarter, but Miami couldn't stop Villanueva, and the Mavs pulled away to win by 21 points. Hassan Whiteside continued to impress. He grabbed a career-high 24 rebounds to go along with 16 points. Over his past three games, he's averaged 15.3 points, 17.7 rebounds and 4.3 blocks. The Heat are 6-7 in January and will have to continue without one of their veteran leaders the next couple weeks, as Dwyane Wade is expected to be sidelined with a hamstring injury for at least the next two to three weeks. The Heat will travel to Boston to face the Celtics on Sunday. The Mavericks will make the short trip to Orlando for the second game of their back-to-back tilt in Florida.

												The Utah Jazz (17-30) defeated the Golden State Warriors (36-8) 110-100 on Friday.Gordon Hayward led the Jazz with 26 points, 15 rebounds and three steals in Utah's biggest win of the season. He also had six assists in 38 minutes in beating the NBA's top team in either conference. Dante Exum, who's been starting at point guard for the Jazz as of late, didn't have a great statistical line but had a plus-19 plus/minus. The Jazz were 0-2 against the Warriors coming into Friday. They lost both games by an average of 12.0 points. Trevor Booker and Rudy Gobert gave them a spark off the bench, combining for 27 points and 17 rebounds.The Warriors have lost back-to-back games for the third time this season. Klay Thomson was kept in check on Friday, scoring just 12 points in 31 minutes while going 0-for-3 from beyond the three-point line. The Warriors were on the losing end of the rebounding battle 55-41, which turned out to be one of the keys in their surprising loss. Golden State now holds just a three-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference standings. The Warriors will head home to take on the Phoenix Suns on Saturday. The Jazz will be off until Tuesday when they face the Trail Blazers in Portland.

												The Phoenix Suns (28-20) beat the Chicago Bulls (30-19) 99-93 on Friday.Phoenix was led by their starting backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. They combined for 44 points, six rebounds, 10 assists, four steals and two blocks. The Suns are 10-4 in January, having put together two separate four-game win streaks this month. Phoenix owns the eighth best record in the Western Conference. They're currently 2.5 games ahead of the New Orleans Pelicans, and would face the Golden State Warriors if the playoffs started today.  The Bulls were coming off two straight overtime games on their West Coast road trip, and may have just ran out of gas. They kept themselves in it late, but Eric Bledsoe's layup with 10 seconds remaining put it in the bag for the Suns. Pau Gasol had a stellar January, averaging 19.6 points, 13.2 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.5 blocks. He finished the month with another nice performance of 10 points and 19 rebounds. Gasol recorded nine straight double-doubles to end the month.  The Suns have won two straight and will take on the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. The Bulls will have off until Wednesday when they face the Houston Rockets who have won four straight games.

												The Orlando Magic (15-34) fell at home Thursday as the Milwaukee Bucks (24-22) cruised to an easy 115-100 victory at the Amway Center.The Bucks took a 59-44 lead at halftime and never looked back. All five of Milwaukee's starters scored in double figures and the Bucks finished the night shooting 52 percent from the field, including 12-for-25 from beyond the arc. Orlando cut into the deficit late in the game, but the outcome was already decided. The Bucks led by as many as 29 in the fourth. Milwaukee has now won three of its last four after Thursday's dominating victory. What's more impressive is that Milwaukee trotted out a patchwork lineup Thursday after Zaza Pachulia and Ersan Ilyasova were sidelined with injuries. Jared Dudley and John Henson filled in admirably for the Pachulia and Ilyasova, with Dudley scoring 17 and Henson posting a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double. Milwaukee will return home Saturday to host Portland on Saturday. Orlando's recent woes continued Thursday as it lost its seventh straight game. Nikola Vucevic had another double-double, contributing 17 points and 14 rebounds in the contest, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lackluster efforts from most of his teammates. The Magic's road doesn't get much easier, with the Mavericks, Thunder, and Spurs on the dockett. 											",Orlando,Magic,Milwaukee,Bucks,Amway Center,24,22,15,34,5.0,18.0,36.0,81.0,21.0,30.0,46.0,13.0,22.0,12.0,25.0,45.0,87.0,13.0,18.0,38.0,29.0,15.0,Aaron Gordon,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Giannis Antetokounmpo,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Channing Frye,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Jared Dudley,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,26,Nikola Vucevic,14.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,8.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,26,John Henson,11.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,12.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Victor Oladipo,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,34,Khris Middleton,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,34,Elfrid Payton,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,38,Brandon Knight,5.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,32,Tobias Harris,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Kenyon Martin,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Evan Fournier,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,30,O.J.

												The Indiana Pacers (17-31) throttled the New York Knicks (9-38) 103-82 Thursday at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Knicks held a five-point deficit at halftime before having a complete meltdown in the third quarter. The Pacers outscored the Knicks 33-12 in the third to all but ice the game. Roy Hibbert scored 10 of his 18 points in the third and added 10 rebounds in the contest to notch his 12th double-double on the season. New York earned an impressive 100-92 win over Oklahoma City on Wednesday but was unable to carry that momentum into Thursday's contest against Indiana. The Knicks were unable to get much of anything going in the second half. Carmelo Anthony hadn't scored less than 20 points in any game this month, but was held to 18 points on 7-of-16  shooting against the Pacers. The Knicks have two days off before hosting the Lakers on Sunday. Indiana was able to rebound nicely after its 104-91 loss to Toronto on Tuesday. George Hill and C.J Miles were both able to play, but were on minutes restrictions and only saw 12 and 13 minutes respectively. Rodney Stuckey led the team in scoring, putting up 22 points on 8-of-13 shooting. The Pacers will look to secure their second straight win Saturday when they host the Kings.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (34-12) trounced the Denver Nuggets (19-28) 99-69 on Thursday at the FedEx Forum. This game can be summed up by a single possession halfway through the third quarter where Memphis' Zach Randolph missed three shots, but pulled down three offensive rebounds and drew a foul. He made both foul shots to give Memphis a 67-47 lead. This possession was indicative of the overall dominance of the Grizzlies in this game coupled with the overall ineptitude displayed by the Nuggets. Randolph finished the night with 15 points and 17 rebounds in just 30 minutes on the floor. Denver stopped the bleeding of a seven-game losing streak Wednesday night by beating New Orleans 93-85 in New Orleans. However, the Nuggets came out flat and were routed by one of the best teams in the West. They shot a paltry 2-for-26 from beyond the arc, which is good enough for 7.7 percent. On the injury front, JaVale McGee returned to the floor in a bench role Thursday and had two points and five rebounds in 15 minutes on the floor. Denver will host Charlotte on Saturday before playing six of its next seven on the road. Memphis is clearly cognizant of the teams breathing down its neck for the second seed in the West and certainly played like it Thursday with a dominant performance. Even without Mike Conley, who is battling a wrist injury, Memphis was able to build a big lead in the early goings. Vince Carter exited the game with a left foot injury and did not return, but the severity of his injury is unclear at this point. Memphis will look to extend its winning streak to six games Saturday when Oklahoma City comes to town.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (13-34) beat the Chicago Bulls (30-18) in thrilling fashion Thursday 123-118 in double overtime.   Chicago entered the fourth quarter lucky to be down just four points after being badly outplayed by Los Angeles. While every shot seemed to be falling for the Lakers, the Bulls couldn't buy a basket--until the very end. Former Laker Pau Gasol tied the game at 98 with just eleven seconds to go, the first tie of the game. The Bulls took 47 minutes to finally look like themselves, but that was enough to force overtime. Los Angeles finally woke back up in the second overtime thanks to clutch performances with Wayne Ellington, Jordan Clarkson, and Jordan Hill.Chicago fought hard, but ran out of gas in the second overtime. Jimmy Butler tied a career-high with 35 points, including 16-18 from the free throw line. However, Butler came out of the game late in the second overtime period and had a trainer examining his knee. Chicago wanted anything but a second straight overtime game on the road, especially when it has a quick turnaround with a game in Phoenix on Friday.  Los Angeles came into Thursday's game on a nine-game losing streak, one shy of the longest such streak since the Lakers moved to L.A. Jordan Hill had a huge game for the Lakers, pouring in 26 points to go along with 12 rebounds. The Lakers will begin a four game Eastern Conference road trip Sunday in New York.

												Kyrie Irving erupted for the highest-scoring night of his career as the Cavaliers (27-20) held on to defeat the Trail Blazers (32-14) on Wednesady night.With LeBron James (wrist) sitting out, this matchup was all about Irving, who was absolutely unstoppable all game long. He went 17-for-36 from the field and a ridiculous 11-for-19 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 55 points, while also adding four rebounds, five assists and two steals. He was extremely clutch for the Cavaliers, scoring their last five points, therefore giving the home crowd the win that they came for and extending the team's winning streak to eight games in a row. Irving is on an unbelievable stretch over his last two games, combining for 93 points, 11 assists and five steals. While Irving did most of it on his own, Kevin Love at least gave a little help, finishing with 10 points (3-15 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 12 rebounds. He shot very poorly, but he still was able to record his fourth double-double in his last six games. Timofey Mozgov had a double-double of his own as well, scoring 12 points (4-9 FG, 4-6 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds.Doing his best to match the numbers Irving was having Wednesday, LaMarcus Aldridge had a very impressive performance as well. Aldridge went 13-for-23 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 38 points, while adding 11 rebounds and two blocked shots as well. While he hasn't produced as much as Irving, Aldridge has still recorded two solid games in a row, combining for 64 points and 20 rebounds over that span. After scoring 27 points on the Cavaliers the last time they played, Damian Lillard struggled this time around, finishing with only 14 points (4-19 FG, 3-10 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five assists. This game marked his worst shooting percentage that he's had all year, so it was a big reason the Trail Blazers ended with a loss. The only other Blazer to reach double figures in points was Wesley Matthews, who hadd 11 points (4-10 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and two assists.Both the Trail Blazers and Cavaliers struggled to find any help from their bench Wednesday. The Blazers' bench totaled 17 points, while the Cavaliers' bench had only 11 points. While the Blazers may have taken the advantage in that category, the Cavaliers took the advantage in rebounding, out-rebounding the Blazers 46-39. That may have just been enough to push them to a victory.The Trail Blazers' next game will be on the road against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Cavaliers will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Friday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (9-37) defeated the Detroit Pistons (17-30) 89-69 on Wednesday.Philadelphia welcomed Michael Carter-Williams back after he missed Monday's 99-74 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans with an illness. He was one rebound shy of a triple-double with 14 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. After giving up a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope layup to start the game, Michael Carter-Williams hit a layup of his own and Philadelphia was off to the races.They would never relinquish the lead and held the Pistons to less than 22 points in each quarter. The Sixers are enjoying their best month of the season, having recorded five wins so far in January.Greg Monroe had a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double as the lone bright spot for the Pistons. The four other starters only managed to combine for 12 points total. D.J. Augustin had been filling in nicely at point guard for the Pistons, who will be without Brandon Jennings (Achilles) for the remainder of the season. Augustin averaged 27 points, 8.5 assists, four rebounds and one steal in his first two starts since taking over but couldn't find the magic Wednesday. He was 0-for-7 on Wednesday, scoring two points in 34 minutes in the Pistons' lowest-scoring output of the season. The Pistons will face the Houston Rockets on Saturday, and the 76ers will take on the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Toronto Raptors (31-15) defeated the Sacramento Kings (16-28) 119-102 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.While the game went into halftime tied 54-54, the Raptors came out firing in the third quarter, out-scoring the Kings 39-22 and allowing themselves to coast to a 17-point victory at home in front of their crowd. The Raptors were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 48 percent from the field and 41 percent from beyond the arc. With their fantastic shooting and rebounding advantage, the Raptors grabbed their fourth straight victory.The biggest contributor for the Raptors surprisingly came off the bench in Wednesday's matchup, as Louis Williams finished with a team-high of 27 points (7-16 FG, 4-12 3Pt, 9-9 FT), while also adding two assists and three steals in only 26 minutes. It was a very nice surprise for the Raptors, as he's only averaging 14.9 points per game so far this season. Greivis Vasquez shot well, going 7-for-9 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also recording four rebounds and six assists. He's really struggled with his shot this season, so it was good to see him turn it around Wednesday. Coming just short of a double-double, Jonas Valanciunas recorded 15 points (6-10 FG, 3-3 FT) and nine rebounds. He's now averaging 12.6 points and 8.5 rebounds on the season. Neither Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan had too big of a night, but each still finished in double figures. Lowry had 13 points (5-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and seven assists, while DeRozan had 12 points (5-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and six assists.The Kings were led by Rudy Gay, who recorded 22 points (8-17 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and three assists. Despite Friday's zero point outing where he played only 13 minutes, Gay has now scored 22 points or more in his last four games. Ben McLemore went 6-for-11 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while also adding five rebounds. It was the most points he's scored since mid-December, so it was good to see him dial in his shot Wednesday. Having one of his least productive games in awhile, DeMarcus Cousins finished with only 13 points (5-10 FG, 3-4 FT), four rebounds and two blocked shots. He matched a season-high of nine turnovers as well, so he'll need to cut those down if the Kings want a chance at winning in the future.The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while the Kings will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (38-8) extended their winning streak to 17 games Wednesday against the Brooklyn Nets (18-27).With the tally resting at 113-102 in favor of the Hawks at the final horn, the Mike Budenholzer-coached squad marked a fifth consecutive margin of victory in double figures. Leading the way with 28 points and 15 rebounds, Paul Millsap tallied his second double-double in a three-game span. Joining Millsap in the double-double club were Al Horford (20 points and 10 boards) and Jeff Teague (13 points and 11 assists), the latter of which has dished out at least seven dimes in seven straight tilts. The NBA's top team in terms of three-point percentage also upheld their standard with 12 successful treys, including five more from the fingertips of Kyle Korver. Off the bench, Dennis Schroder logged two productive stretches of scoring en route to 13 points (5-8 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT). A tough test now awaits the Hawks, who take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday.The Nets received a three-day layoff due to Monday's blizzard postponement, but they couldn't return to winning ways Wednesday. While they avoided losing by 35-plus points for a third contest in a row, a 45 percent showing from the field and 9-for-24 shooting from beyond the arc weren't enough against the leaders of the Eastern Conference. Joe Johnson paced Brooklyn with 26 points in 37 minutes, while Jarrett Jack got back on track, recording 14 points and 13 assists. The starting five experienced a change prior to the opening tip, as Bojan Bogdanovic was swapped for Alan Anderson. Anderson proceeded to post 15 points and a season-high six assists, but other than Brook Lopez's 18 points and seven rebounds, the bench mob contributed a paltry 11 points and eight boards. Upon next taking the court Friday, the Nets will face another playoff worthy squad, the Toronto Raptors.

												The San Antonio Spurs (30-17) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (19-27) 95-86 on Wednesday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.The Spurs got a really quick start in this game, out-scoring the Hornets 55-38 in the first half alone. While they struggled to get anything going in the third quarter, the Spurs did enough damage in the first two, that they were still able to coast to the victory. The Spurs were also able to out-rebound the Hornets 49-43, giving them an even greater advantage over the Hornets.The Spurs back court of Tony Parker and Danny Green did most of the damage for the Spurs in this one. Parker went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-3 from the free throw line to score a team-high of 17 points, while also adding five assists in 27 minutes. He had a very poor shooting performance (3-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt) in Sunday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks, so it was good to see him get back over 50 percent for his shooting percentage Wednesday. Green on the other hand finished with 16 points (6-11 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 0-1 FT), five rebounds, two steals and three blocked shots in 26 minutes. It was his first time reaching double-digit points in his last five games, as he's been struggling with his shot. Tim Duncan notched a double-double with 12 points, 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. It was his second straight double-double, as he's combined for 32 points and 25 rebounds in those two matchups.Al Jefferson and Gerald Henderson did everything they could to keep the Hornets close in this game. Jefferson went 8-for-12 from the field to score 17 points, while also adding 16 rebounds. He's now averaging 17.4 points and 8.2 rebounds on the season. Henderson on the other hand recorded 18 points (6-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), three assists and two blocked shots. Despite averaging 10.5 points so far this season, it was the second game in a row with 14 or more points. In only 25 minutes, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went 7-for-13 from the field to score 14 points. He's now averaging 13.0 points over his last three games. The only other Hornet to reach double figures was Gary Neal, who came off the bench to score 12 points (4-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 18 minutes.The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, while the Hornets will travel to Denver to play the Nuggets on Saturday.

												The Houston Rockets (32-14) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (30-17) 99-94 on Wednesday.Dwight Howard sat out his second-straight game with a sprained ankle. Joey Dorsey stepped in for Howard at the starting center position, but played just 13 minutes and failed to score. Josh Smith led the Rockets with 18 points, as he hit 4-of-5 shots from beyond the arc. James Harden continued his magnificent season Wednesday. He scored 17 points on 7-of-14 shooting from the field. In Harden's four games prior to Wednesday, he has scored 33 points or more, including a 45-point explosion on Jan. 19 against the Pacers. He has been contributing across the board this season, averaging 27.6 points, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 0.8 blocks a game in his campaign for MVP.Monta Ellis led the Mavericks with 33 points. Chandler Parsons and Dirk Nowitzki combined for 35 points on 7-of-12 shooting from beyond the three-point line. Al-Farouq Aminu had a nice game off the bench. Aminu blocked six shots and had three steals in an impressive defensive performance. Rajon Rondo isn't known for his scoring and that was apparent Wednesday night, as he went 0-for-7 from the field and failed to score a point for the first time since becoming a Maverick. Rondo is averaging 9.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 6.7 assists in January for Dallas, who has now lost four-straight games.Dallas will travel to Miami to take on the Heat on Friday, and the Rockets will head to Boston to face the Celtics on Friday. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Boston,Celtics,Target Center,16,28,8,37,,,,,,,,,,7.0,21.0,41.0,85.0,7.0,9.0,36.0,21.0,13.0,Thaddeus Young,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,39,Jae Crowder,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14,Gorgui Dieng,14.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,34,Jared Sullinger,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,34,Nikola Pekovic,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Brandon Bass,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,22,Andrew Wiggins,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,39,Avery Bradley,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,37,Zach LaVine,4.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,23,Evan Turner,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Kevin Martin,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,18.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,29,Marcus Smart,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,23,Lorenzo Brown,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,24,Tyler Zeller,9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Chase Budinger,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13,Marcus Thornton,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,14,Anthony Bennett,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8,Gerald Wallace,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Troy Daniels,,,,,,,,,,,,Tayshaun Prince,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22

												The Denver Nuggets (19-27) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (24-22) 93-85 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three-point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out-rebounded the Nuggets 48-39, but it wasn't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home.Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7-for-13 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double-double, finishing with 15 points (7-9 FG, 1-2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He hasn't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 6.5 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6-11 FG, 2-3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12.0 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2-12 FG, 1-2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate.Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11-22 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8-15 FG, 8-10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double-doubles in a row, averaging 26.3 points and 11.0 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and didn't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25-point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3-10 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and seven rebounds.  The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, while the Pelicans will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.

												The New York Knicks (9-37) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (23-23) 100-92 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Knicks were the superior shooters in this game, going 44 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Thunder went 40 percent from the floor and a meager 23 percent from beyond the arc. The Knicks had an impressive second half, out-scoring the Thunder 57-47 to seal the victory in front of their home crowd.Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks in this game, scoring 31 points (12-28 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-7 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds. He sat out of Saturday's game for a day of rest, but came back right where left off with another impressive performance. Rookie Langston Galloway continues to show production. He went 7-for-15 from the field and 3-for-7 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding four rebounds, four assists and three steals. In the five games he's started this season, he's now averaging 15.2 points and 5.8 rebounds. The Knicks also saw some production off the bench. Lance Thomas scored 17 points (8-13 FG, 1-2 FT) and had five rebounds in 24 minutes, while Tim Hardaway Jr finished with 14 points (4-8 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and two assists in 22 minutes. Thomas is averaging 16.3 points and 5.7 rebounds over his last three games, as he's played well of late.With Kevin Durant sitting out with a toe injury, Russell Westbrook continued to do the bulk of the scoring, finishing with 40 points (13-30 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 12-12 FT), four assists and two steals in 34 minutes. He matched a season-high of 30 field goal attempts, so it's not surprising he was able to score so many points. He's now averaging 24.7 points and 7.6 assists on the season. Serge Ibaka recorded a double-double, as he posted 10 points (3-9 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 10 rebounds. It was his fourth double-double in a row, as he's averaging 12.8 points and 12.3 rebounds over that span. The only other Thunder player to reach double figures in points was Reggie Jackson, who had 13 points (6-11 FG, 1-4 3Pt), seven rebounds, four assists and four steals in 28 minutes.The Knicks' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday, while the Thunder will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Saturday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (32-14) defeated the Utah Jazz (16-30) 94-89 on Wednesday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.While both teams shot very similar percentages from the field, the Clippers took the upper had from behind the three-point line, going 35 percent from deep, while the Jazz went just 21 percent from beyond the arc. Coming out of the third quarter, the Clippers were actually down 72-68, but they got hot in the fourth quarter, out-scoring the Jazz 26-17 to secure the five-point victory.With J.J. Redick sitting this game out with back spasms, Jamal Crawford jumped into the starting shooting guard position, matching a team-high in points with 21 (5-14 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 7-7 FT), while also adding two steals in 39 minutes. It was his second game in a row passing the 20-point plateau, as he's combined for 44 points in those two matchups. Chris Paul was the other player to score 21 points (8-16 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 4-5 FT), while he also had five rebounds and six assists. Over his last three games he's averaged 19.7 points and 8.7 rebounds, as he's had the hot hand for the Clippers. Coming just shy of a double-double, Blake Griffin had 17 points (7-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and seven rebounds. He's now averaging 22.8 points and 7.6 rebounds on the season. Austin Rivers was the only player to score off the bench, posting 12 points (5-8 FG, 2-4 3Pt) in 22 minutes.The Jazz saw most of their production from their front court. Enes Kanter had another strong showing, scoring 21 points (8-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and grabbing 11 rebounds. He's turned it on offensively of late, scoring 20 or more points in four out of his last five games. Derrick Favors nearly recorded a double-double of his own with 18 points (8-13 FG, 2-4 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He's been playing good defense around the rim in his last three games, posting at least two blocks in each matchup. Trey Burke continued to come off the bench, with Dante Exum in as the starting point guard. Burke played more minutes though, notching 11 points (4-15 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and four rebounds in 30 minutes. Exum struggled to a meager three points, as he shot just 1-of-6 from the field and 1-for-5 from the three-point line in 26 minutes, so the Jazz will need better guard play if they want to have a better showing in their next game.  The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, while the Jazz will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Friday.

												The Phoenix Suns (27-20) defeated the Washington Wizards (31-16) 106-98 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.Coming out of the third quarter, the Suns had a nice 80-66 lead. The Wizards made a run in the fourth though, out-scoring the Suns 32-26, but the comeback fell short as Phoenix finished with an eight-point victory. While the Suns were out-rebounded 50-41, they shot better than the Wizards, going 46 percent from the field, while the Wizards went 42 percent from the floor.Goran Dragic was the leader for the Suns in this game, posting a game-high of 20 points (8-15 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-4 FT), to go along with two assists and two steals. He had a poor shooting performance (3-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt) in Sunday's game against the Clippers, so it was good to see him find his shot and have some success. The Suns also had a nice contribution from their bench, as Isaiah Thomas had 18 points (4-13 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 6-7 FT) and four assists in only 20 minutes. He's been playing his best basketball of the season offensively, averaging 23.2 points over his last five games. Brandan Wright also had an efficient night from the bench with 13 points (6-7 FG, 1-1 FT) and five rebounds in only 17 minutes.  Coming close to a double-double, Markieff Morris had 16 points (7-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), seven rebounds and four assists. He's averaging 15.3 points and 5.7 rebounds on the season.Leading the Wizards in points was center Marcin Gortat, who went 6-for-12 from the field to score 14 points, while also adding eight rebounds. It's a very rare occurence for Gortat to lead this team in scoring, so it was clear John Wall and Bradley Beal didn't have their best games offensively. Wall recorded 11 points (5-16 FG, 1-3 3Pt), seven rebounds and seven assists, while Beal had 13 points (5-15 FG, 3-3 3Pt) and one rebound. Wall had just put in three solid games in a row, so it was a surprise to see his shot not falling. Getting the start at power forward, Kris Humphries recorded a double-double with 11 points (4-8 FG, 3-4 FT) and 15 rebounds. It was his second double-double in his last three games. Otto Porter was the high scorer off the bench with 14 points (5-8 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) in 23 minutes.The Suns' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday, while the Wizards will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday.

												The Toronto Raptors (30-15) notched their 30th win of the season Tuesday, defeating the Indiana Pacers (16-31) 104-91 at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse.The Raptors held a five-point lead mid way through the third quarter before reeling off a 17-6 run to go up by double digits. Toronto's DeMar DeRozan snapped out of his cold streak on the road by scoring a game-high 24 points after managing just 14 points in his previous three games away from the Air Canada Centre. Toronto has now won both of its meetings with Indiana this season. Toronto has now won three straight to move into a tie for second place in the East. Kyle Lowry had a terrific performance with 19 points, eight assists, and seven rebounds in 34 minutes on the floor. The Raptors will play the second installment of a back-to-back set Wednesday when they host the Kings. Indiana snapped its seven-game losing streak Sunday against Orlando, but was unable to carry that momentum into Tuesday's contest. C.J Miles missed his second consecutive game with a groin injury and is considered questionable for Thursday's match up with the Knicks. George Hill was able to play his third straight game, but was on a minutes limit. He compiled 13 points, three assists, and two rebounds in 20 minutes of action. The Pacers have four games remaining on their current homestand. 											",Indiana,Pacers,Toronto,Raptors,Bankers Life Fieldhouse,30,15,16,31,7.0,18.0,33.0,80.0,15.0,21.0,42.0,21.0,14.0,9.0,26.0,34.0,73.0,27.0,34.0,42.0,21.0,10.0,Solomon Hill,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,35,DeMar DeRozan,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,33,David West,8.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Amir Johnson,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Roy Hibbert,9.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Jonas Valanciunas,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Rodney Stuckey,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,38,Greivis Vasquez,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,28,C.J.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (26-20) defeated the Detroit Pistons (17-29) 103-95 on Tuesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.Despite securing the victory, the Cavliers were out-shot in this matchup. The Pistons went 42 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Cavaliers went 42 percent from the field and just 27 percent from beyond the arc. The Cavaliers were also out-rebounded 51-47 by the Pistons. Where the Cavaliers gained the advantage though was in turnovers, as they forced the Pistons into 18 turnovers, while committing only nine of their own. It was just enough of an advantage, that it may have been the difference that pushed them to a win.Kyrie Irving and LeBron James were unstoppable Tuesday, combining for 70 of the Cavaliers' 103 total points. Irving led the team with 38 points (13-23 FG, 6-10 3Pt, 6-6 FT), while also adding six assists and three steals. He's now combined for 59 points over his last two games, as he's been a big part in the Cavaliers' seven-game win streak. James on the other hand finished with 32 points (11-24 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 10-11 FT), six rebounds and seven assists. He's been on an absolute tear lately, averaging 29.7 points during their last seven wins. While James and Irving had huge outings, the third member of the big three, Kevin Love, didn't have his best game. He struggled with his shot, scoring only seven points (3-11 FG, 1-8 3Pt), but did at least add eight rebounds as well.Starting at point guard, D.J. Augustin was the a big reason the Pistons were able to keep this game close. Augustin nearly double-doubled, finishing with 19 points (8-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt), nine assists and two steals. In the two games since Brandon Jennings went down with a season-ending injury, Augustin has combined for 54 points and 17 assists. Both Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond had strong showings as well, with each notching a double-double of their own. Monroe had 17 points (7-15 FG, 3-3 FT) and 12 rebounds, while Drummond had 12 points (6-17 FG, 0-4 FT), 17 rebounds and six blocked shots. The six blocks were a new season-high for Drummond, as he dominated the paint Tuesday. Coming off the bench, Anthony Tolliver shot really well, scoring 16 points (4-5 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT) in 29 minutes. He's now reached double figures in scoring during two out of his last three games, despite averaging only 4.7 points per game this season.  The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, while the Pistons will travel to Philadelphia to play the 76ers on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (20-25) fell to the Milwaukee Bucks (23-22) 109-102 on Tuesday at the AmericanAirlines Arena. In a game between the sixth and seventh seeds in the East, Milwaukee prevailed thanks in part to an excellent shooting performance. The Bucks finished the night shooting 54.9% from the floor as a team. Miami entered Tuesday's contest without Luol Deng and Chris Andersen, but things got worse when Dwayne Wade exited the game with a hamstring injury. Although Wade didn't injure the same hamstring that sidelined him earlier this month, it was still severe enough to force him from the game. Milwaukee improved to 13-12 on the road after Tuesday's victory. Power forward Ersan Ilyasova left the game with a groin injury and did not return, but the Bucks were resilient. Milwaukee had seven players score in double figures, with four of them coming off the bench. The Bucks will look to further solidify their playoff position Thursday against the Magic in Orlando. Miami was coming off an impressive win in Chicago on Sunday, but a rash of injuries left it thin against Milwaukee. Danny Granger got the start in Deng's place and posted 14 points, six rebounds, and two assists over 36 minutes. Hassan Whiteside, who garnered national attention with his 12 block performance against the Bulls on Sunday, had another strong game. Whiteside moved into the starting lineup and finished the game with 16 points and 16 rebounds, but ironically did not record a block against the Bucks. The Heat have two days off to get healthy before taking the floor Friday against the Mavericks.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (33-12) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (30-16) 109-90 on Tuesday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.After finishing the first quarter tied at 24, the Grizzlies went off and never looked back, out-scoring the Mavericks 85-66 in the final three quarters. The Grizzlies were the more effective shooters in this game, going 53 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three-point line, while the Mavericks shot 49 percent from the field and just 27 percent from beyond the arc. The Grizzlies also secured a 40-35 rebounding advantage, further helping to secure an impressive 19-point victory on the road.Zach Randolph was a force in this game, going 10-for-15 from the field and 2-for-4 from the free throw line to score 22 points, while also adding 10 rebounds. It was his second impressive performance in a row, combining for 46 points and 20 rebounds over that span. It was also his tenth straight double-double. Marc Gasol had a strong showing as well, finishing with 15 points (7-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-1 FT), four rebounds and six assists. The Grizzlies' front court was very effective, out-playing the tough defensive front court of the Mavericks. Playing 30 minutes, Courtney Lee was dialed in with his shot, scoring 13 points (5-7 Fg, 3-4 3Pt) and handing out a pair of assists. The Grizzlies also saw a great effort from Nick Calathes and Vince Carter off the bench. Calathes had 13 points (4-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT), five rebounds and two steals, while Carter finished with 12 points (3-10 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT), three rebounds and two steals of his own.The Mavericks on the other hand saw most of their production from the duo of Chandler Parsons and Monta Ellis. Parsons shot 7-for-11 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also adding three assists. He struggled to only six points on Sunday, so it was good to see him turn things around. Ellis finished with 19 points (8-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own, but didn't do much else with only one rebound and one assist. He's been impressive offensively over his last two games, combining for 55 points. Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler reached double figures in points as well, with 11 and 10 points respectively, but weren't able to do it defensively as both Randolph and Gasol were very effective against them.The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Thursday, while the Mavericks will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (36-7) fell to the Chicago Bulls (30-17) in overtime Tuesday by a score of 113-111.In an incredible, back-and-fourth game between the league's best home team and third-best road team, the Bulls came out on top. Golden State was unable to extend their home winning streak to 20 games as Klay Thompson's last second floater was off the mark. The Warriors were uncharacteristically cold from beyond the arc, going 0-13 from three in the second half and overtime. The adage ""live by the three, die by the three"" rang true Tuesday night for the Warriors. Chicago kicked off its pivotal six-game road trip with a feat that only one other team has accomplished this season, beating the Warriors at the Oracle Arena. Derrick Rose finished the night with an interesting stat-line, with 30 points on 33 shots, one assist, and a career-high 11 turnovers. Stats never tell the whole story, however. Rose's last shot was a step-back three with seven seconds remaining to give the Bulls the final lead. The Bulls will continue its road trip on Thursday against the Lakers.Golden State hadn't lost at home since Nov. 13, when it fell to San Antonio 113-100. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 51 points, but were just 6-for-19 from beyond the arc. The Warriors were missing Andrew Bogut, who was a late scratch after coming down with flu-like symptoms. Despite Tuesday's loss, the Warriors still hold a four-and-a-half game lead in the West.

												The Washington Wizards (31-15) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12-34) 98-92 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Coming into halftime, the Lakers had taken a 57-46 lead and were playing quite well against a tough opponent. The Wizards exploded in the second half though, out-scoring the Lakers 52-35 over that span, giving the Wizards a six-point victory on the road. The Wizards were the better shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field, while the Lakers shot just 43 percent. The Wizards also secured a huge 51-38 rebounding advantage, helping push them to a win.The Wizards' backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal did most of the damage to the Lakers. Wall came one rebound shy of a triple-double, finishing with 21 points (8-12 FG, 5-12 FT), nine rebounds, 13 assists and three steals. It was his second straight double-double, as he's combined for 39 points and 29 assists over his last two games. Beal on the other hand recorded 19 points (9-18 FG, 1-6 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists. He had a poor display from the three-point line, but still finished well over his 14.8 points per game scoring average. With Paul Pierce sitting this game out, Otto Porter moved into the starting lineup and had a very productive game. He went 5-for-9 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 12 points in 29 minutes. Marcin Gortat reached double figures as well with 11 points (5-7 FG, 1-1 FT) and seven rebounds of his own.The Lakers were led by Wayne Ellington, who scored a season-high as he continued to replace Kobe Bryant in the starting lineup. Ellington finished with a game-high of 28 points (12-20 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 1-1 FT), while also adding three assists and three steals. The steals were also a season-high for him, as it was easily his best showing of the year. He's now recorded double figures in four straight games, despite averaging only 7.7 points on the year. Rookie Jordan Clarkson had himself a day as well with the starting lineup. He recorded a season-high of 18 points (8-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT), to go along with three rebounds and three assists. The Lakers just didn't get help from any of their other starters, who combined for only 15 points. The only other Laker to reach double-digit points was Ed Davis, who came off the bench for 14 points (6-7 FG, 2-2 FT).The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (32-12) defeated the Orlando Magic (15-33) 103-94 on Monday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.The Grizzlies came out strong Monday, grabbing a 67-48 lead by the end of the first half. While the Magic made a run in the fourth quarter, they weren't able to finish off their comeback, and fell nine points short, giving the Grizzlies a victory in front of their home crowd. The Grizzlies were also very effective from the free throw line, converting on 24-of-26, while the Magic made just 16-of-25 from the line.Zach Randolph had his way with the Magic in this matchup. He went 8-for-13 from the field and 8-for-8 from the free throw line to score 24 points, while also nearing a triple-double with 10 rebounds and six assists. He's now recorded 10 or more rebounds in 15 straight games, pushing his season average to 11.9 rebounds per game. Marc Gasol finished with a double-double of his own, scoring 16 points (5-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-7 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds. He recorded only nine points on Saturday against the Sixers, so it was a nice bounce back game offensively for him. With Tony Allen sidelined because of an ankle injury, Jeff Green entered the starting lineup. He shot the ball well, going 4-for-6 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score 12 points in 26 minutes. He's now averaging 16.9 points and 4.3 rebounds on the year. Coming off the bench, Beno Udrih finished with 15 points (6-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), five assists and four steals.While he wasn't able to limit Gasol or Randolph defensively, Nikola Vucevic continued to play well offensively, scoring 18 points (6-13 FG, 6-7 FT) and grabbing 12 rebounds. He's averaging 26.3 points and 13.0 rebounds over his last four games, so he hasn't been slowing down lately. Victor Oladipo was the other player to score 18 points (6-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), while also adding seven rebounds and two assists. He's gone a combined 14-for-28 from the field over his last last two games, scoring 36 points over that span. Coming off the bench, Dewayne Dedmon notched a double-double with 10 points (4-5 FG, 2-6 FT) and 10 rebounds in 30 minutes. Channing Frye played only 12 minutes in this game as a starter, so Dedmon took most of the extra playing time. The only other Magic player to reach double figures was rookie Elfrid Payton, who posted 12 points and six assists in 35 minutes.The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, while the Magic will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (24-21) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (8-37) 99-74 on Monday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Pelicans got started quickly in this game, out-scoring the Sixers 30-19 in the first quarter alone. The Pelicans were the superior shooters, going 45 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers shot just 35 percent from the floor and a meager 13 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans also did it on the glass though, securing a 52-38 rebounding advantage.The Pelicans were led by Anthony Davis, who continued his strong stretch of games and finished with 32 points (12-19 FG, 8-8 FT), 10 rebounds, three steals and four blocked shots. It was his third straight double-double, as he's averaged 27.0 points and 10.7 rebounds over that span of games. Coming off the bench, Ryan Anderson stayed a consistent part of the Pelicans' offense. He went 7-for-14 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also adding seven rebounds and three steals. He's combined for 37 points and 12 rebounds over his last two games, while his three steals matched a season-high. Tyreke Evans finally slowed down offensively though, recording only six points in 28 minutes. He did post 12 assists for the second straight night though, as he's been focusing on getting his teammates opportunities. Eric Gordon chipped in with 13 points (5-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and five assists as well.The Sixers' biggest contributor came from their bench Monday. That was rookie K.J. McDaniels, who went 5-for-8 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 16 points in 27 minutes. Despite averaging only 9.2 points per game so far this season, he's now recorded 12 or more points in three out of his last four games, so he's starting to get in a rhythm. With Michael Carter-Williams sitting out because of an illness, Larry Drew got the start at point guard. He really struggled in his 31 minutes of playing time, finishing with only four points (2-9 FG, 0-4 3Pt) and five rebounds. Both Henry Sims and Luc Mbah A Moute reached double figures as well. Sims had 14 points (4-9 FG, 6-8 FT) and three rebounds, while Mbah A Moute had 14 points (6-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and three rebounds of his own.  The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (23-22) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (7-37) 92-84 on Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.Neither team shot very well in this matchup, but the Thunder still had the slight advantage, going 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves went just 34 percent from the floor and a meager 15 percent from beyond the arc. The Thunder were able to use a strong first half, out-scoring the Timberwolves 48-40, giving them enough of an advantage to secure the victory in front of their home crowd.With Kevin Durant sitting out with a sprained toe, Russell Westbrook did most of the shooting Monday, going 7-for-22 from the field to score 18 points in 30 minutes. It may not have been his best performance shooting the ball, but it was still enough to push the Thunder to a victory. Westbrook is averaging 23.5 points over his last four games. Serge Ibaka had a strong showing as well, scoring 13 points (6-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt) and grabbing a ridiculous 19 rebounds. The double-double was his third in a row, while the 19 rebounds were a new season-high. The Thunder got a lot of help from their bench though. Both Anthony Morrow (5-13 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and Reggie Jackson (5-7 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-3 FT) scored 14 points, while Dion Waiters added 10 (4-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-4 FT) points.Thaddeus Young and Andrew Wiggins were the biggest reasons that the Timberwolves were able to stay competitive in this game. Young had 22 points (8-20 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and eight rebounds, while Wiggins had 23 points (7-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 9-12 FT), four rebounds and two steals. Young has had an impressive couple of games in a row, combining for 48 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists over that span. He's starting to find his groove, after not living up to expectations so far this season.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Utah Jazz 99-90 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.The Celtics were the superior shooters in this game, going 47 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Jazz went 43 percent from the floor and 38 percent from beyond the arc. Boston also secured the advantage at the free throw line, making 21-of-23, as the Jazz made only 11-of-19.The Celtics received their biggest contributions from their bench in this game. Tayshaun Prince went 7-for-10 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 19 points, while also adding five assists in 30 minutes. It was only his fifth game played for the Celtics, but easily his best, after combining for only 17 in all four of his previous games. Tyler Zeller also came off the bench and recorded 14 points (6-8 FG, 2-2 FT) and seven rebounds in 29 minutes. He's combined for 29 points and 12 rebounds over his last two games. Avery Bradley and Jared Sullinger, the team's two scoring leaders, both finished in double figures as well. Sullinger had 12 points (4-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and nine rebounds, while Bradley had 12 points (4-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and a steal.Gordon Hayward and Enes Kanter did the bulk of the damage for the Jazz, although it wasn't enough to help the Jazz grab a victory. Hayward went 7-for-17 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score 26 points, while also adding six rebounds and three steals. He's had a really impressive week with his shot, averaging 24.7 points over his last three games. Kanter on the other hand scored 20 points (10-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt), to go along with six rebounds before fouling out. He's recorded 20 or more points in three out of his last four games, despite averaging 14.1 points so far this year. Trey Burke continued to come off the bench, and played really well offensively, finishing with 18 points (7-20 FG, 4-12 3Pt) in 32 minutes. Dante Exum was the starter at point guard in his previous spot, but had a tough outing, going scoreless (0-2 FG, 0-2 3Pt) with two assists in 25 minutes.   The Celtics' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, while the Jazz will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (31-14) defeated the Denver Nuggets (18-27) 102-98 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.After coming out of the third quarter down 77-69, the Clippers went off in the fourth, out-scoring the Nuggets 33-21 to secure the four-point victory in front of their home crowd. While both teams shot nearly identical percentages from the field, the Clippers were able to take an advantage on the boards, out-rebounding the Nuggets 45-38 to give them just enough of an advantage to grab the win.The Clippers were led by Jamal Crawford Monday, who recorded 23 points (6-14 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 8-9 FT), four rebounds and three assists in 30 minutes off the bench. Crawford really struggled with his shot in Sunday's game against the Phoenix Suns, so it was good to see him turn things around Monday. Matt Barnes had a strong showing as well, going 7-for-11 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 18 points in 33 minutes. It was a nice surprise for the Clippers, as he's only averaging 9.8 points per game so far this year. Blake Griffin didn't have as big of a game offensively as he's come accustomed to, but still recorded nearly a triple-double with 14 points (6-17 FG, 2-4 FT), nine rebounds and 10 assists. It was the first time he's scored less than 15 points in his last 11 games, but the rebounds and assists made up for it. Chris Paul was the other Clipper to reach double figures in points, finishing with 15 points (7-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt) and eight assists.The Nuggets' backcourt did most of the damage in this game. Ty Lawson went 7-for-12 from the field and 5-for-6 from the free throw line to score 19 points, while also adding 11 assists. It was his second double-double in a row, as he's gone a combined 50 points and 23 assists over those two games. Arron Afflalo on the other hand added 18 points (8-13 FG, 2-4 3Pt) and six assists as well. He's now averaging 15.2 points and 3.6 rebounds so far this year. Wilson Chandler was able to record a double-double of his own, finishing with 18 points (7-18 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 10 rebounds. He's had two productive games in a row as well, combining for 38 points and 19 rebounds. The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was Kenneth Faried, who posted 14 points (6-9 FG, 2-3 FT) in 30 minutes.The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, while the Nuggets will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (20-24) captured an impressive win on the road Sunday, defeating the Chicago Bulls (29-17) 96-84. Miami big man Hassan Whiteside stole the show in Chicago, putting up 14 points and 13 rebounds. That wasn't the impressive part, however, as he also had a franchise-record 12 blocks against one of the NBA's best front courts. Whiteside recorded the triple-double despite only playing 25 minutes. Miami has now won two in a row after Sunday's victory. Luol Deng turned in a solid game against his former team, putting up 15 points and 10 rebounds. Hassan Whiteside was not in the starting lineup and actually missed Friday's game due to an ankle injury. That didn't stop him from having a dominant performance on a big stage. Miami will look to extend its winning streak Tuesday when the Heat host the Bucks. Chicago entered Sunday having won two straight over Western Conference foes, but wasn't able to get the win at home against a sub-.500 Miami club Sunday. Joakim Noah was able to suit up again despite a nagging ankle injury, but only had four points and five rebounds in 22 minutes.  Pau Gasol had another huge game, recording 13 points and 17 rebounds to notch his league-leading 27th double-double. He has had at least 15 rebounds in four of his last five games. The Bulls will begin a crucial six-game road trip Tuesday against the Warriors.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (25-20) continued their hot streak Sunday, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder (22-22) 108-98 at the Quicken Loans Arena. In a matchup between two of the league's biggest stars, LeBron James and Kevin Durant both put up huge games. James shouldered a bit more of the offensive load than usual, taking 25 shots from the floor to finish with 34 points. Durant countered with 32 points and nine assists. He landed awkwardly on a drive late in the fourth quarter, but was able to play through it for the rest of the game. Oklahoma City wrapped up its five game road trip Sunday with a 4-2 mark. Steven Adams, the team's usual starter, was dealing with migraines before tip off and did not play. Kendrick Perkins got the start at center and finished with four points and four rebounds before fouling out late in the fourth. The Thunder will return home Monday to host the Timberwolves. Cleveland has now won six in a row, with three of those wins coming against quality opponents. Kevin Love turned in a solid effort, finishing with 19 points and 13 rebounds to mark his 24th double-double this season. The Cavaliers will play the front end of a back-to-back Tuesday in Detroit before returning home to host the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (23-21) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (30-15) 109-106 on Sunday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.Fighting to get back into the playoff hunt in the stacked Western Conference, the Pelicans have started to hit their stride, notching their third straight victory in a row. They used their superior shooting in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Mavericks went 48 percent from the floor and just 38 percent from beyond the arc.The Pelicans saw huge days from both Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evans. Davis finished with 28 points (8-18 FG, 12-14 FT), 10 rebounds and five steals, notching his third double-double over his last four games. He's currently having a very strong stretch of games, averaging 27.8 points and 9.8 rebounds over his last five. Ever since taking over for Jrue Holiday as the starting point guard, Evans has been very impressive. On Sunday he recorded 24 points (11-19 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and 12 assists, giving him his sixth double-double of the year. Over his last five games Evans has averaged 21.8 points, helping to take the pressure off of Davis, who is the biggest scoring threat on their roster. The Pelicans also had some strong contributions off thier bench. Ryan Anderson went 6-for-10 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding five rebounds. Quincy Pondexter had the other solid performance off the bench, recording 14 points (4-10 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and five rebounds in 28 minutes.The Mavericks were led by the duo of Dirk Nowitzki and Monta Ellis. Ellis went 16-for-27 from the field and 4-for-9 from the three-point line to record a game-high of 36 points, while also addding five rebounds. He came just shy of matching a season-high in points, but boosted his season scoring average to 19.9 points per game. Nowitzki on the other hand finished with 24 points (8-19 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and six rebounds. It was his second straight night with 23 points, as he's a combined 18-of-34 from the field over the last two games. Rajon Rondo had solid showing Sunday, going 7-for-10 from the field and 2-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 17 points. He also came just shy of a double-double with nine rebounds to go along with it. It was one of his better games for the Mavericks this season, but it wasn't enough to get them the victory. Coming off the bench, Dwight Powell added 10 points and six assists.The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (37-8) extended their franchise-record winning streak to 16 games Sunday, defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves (7-36) 112-100. The Timberwolves gave the Hawks a much better game than many were expecting, coming within six points of the Hawks with three minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Hawks once again had solid efforts all around, with six players scoring in double figures. Minnesota's Thaddeus Young helped keep the Timberwolves in the game with 26 points on 11-of-17 shooting, but Atlanta's timely three-point shooting helped seal it down the stretch. Minnesota has now dropped four games in a row and currently hold the worst record in the NBA, but should be encouraged by the effort put forth against an Atlanta team that is arguably the best in the league. Nikola Pekovic returned to the starting lineup Sunday and posted 13 points and three rebounds in the contest. The Timberwolves will have a quick turnaround, finishing up a back-to-back road set Monday in Oklahoma City. Atlanta's win marked its remarkable 11th consecutive win against Western Conference opponents. Backup point guard Dennis Schroder had an efficient 11 points in 16 minutes on the floor and provided suffocating defense. Paul Millsap had an excellent game as well with 20 points, five rebounds, six assists, and four steals in the contest. The Hawks will look to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday when they host a struggling Nets team.

												The Indiana Pacers (16-30) defeated the Orlando Magic (15-32) 106-99 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando.After ending the third quarter down 82-75, the Pacers went off in the fourth quarter, out-scoring the Magic 31-17 to steal the seven-point victory on the road. The Pacers were the superior shooters in this game, going 52 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic went 49 percent from the floor and just 35 percent from beyond the arc.The Pacers received contributions from all over the court Sunday with six players reaching double figures in points. David West led the way, recording 20 points (8-15 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT), four rebounds and two steals. He hadn't been playing his best basketball over the last three games, so it was good to see him turn things around. Roy Hibbert notched a double-double, finishing with 11 points and 13 rebounds in only 23 minutes. He hasn't played more than 20 minutes in each of his last three games, so with a little bit more time on the court, Hibbert was able to increase his production. Rodney Stuckey had a strong showing as well with 15 points (6-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six assists. He's now averaging 11.2 points and 2.9 assists per game on the season. The Pacers bench had an impressive performance, led by George Hill and Damjan Rudez. Hill had 17 points (7-15 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and six rebounds, while Rudez had 18 points (7-10 FG, 4-7 3Pt) and three rebounds. The 18 points were a career-high for Rudez.As has been the case for most of the season, Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic did most of the damage for the Magic. Vucevic led all scorers, finishing with 27 points (11-17 FG, 5-5 FT) and seven rebounds. He's been unstoppable lately, averaging 29.0 points and 14.3 rebounds over his last three games. Oladipo on the other hand recorded 18 points (8-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) of his own, to go along with three assists. He was about right on par with his season averages of 16.4 points and 3.9 assists per game. Tobias Harris continued to come off the bench, but still played 30 minutes, finishing with 11 points and seven rebounds. The only other Magic player to reach double figures in points was Elfrid Payton, who contributed 10 points and eight assists.The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, while the Magic will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Monday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (29-17) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (22-22) 101-95 on Sunday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.Despite a strong first half where the Bucks out-scored the Spurs 55-47, they weren't able to hold off the reigning NBA champion Spurs in the secondf, suffering a tough six-point loss on the road. While the Bucks shot better from field and the three-point line, they were dominated at the free throw line where the Spurs went 26-for-30 and the Bucks finished just 9-for-13. The Bucks also committed 21 turnovers, which may have been another big difference in this game.The Spurs had a strong showing from their frontcourt, as forwards Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard were the team-leaders in both points and rebounds. In 31 minutes, Duncan finished with 20 points (9-13 FG, 2-2 FT) and 11 rebounds, while Leonard had 19 points (4-11 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 10-12 FT) and 14 rebounds in 36 minutes. It was Leonard's third double-double in his last four games, recording at least 14 rebounds in each of those matchups. Tony Parker really struggled with his shot for the Spurs (3-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), but still contributed 10 points and five assists. He's now averaging 14.5 points and 4.7 assists on the season. The Spurs did find some production off their bench, with two players finishing in double figures in points. Boris Diaw had 14 points (7-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and three rebounds, while Manu Ginobili finished with 13 points (3-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and three assists.Despite the loss, Kris Middleton played well, going 9-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to finish with 21 points and five rebounds as a starter at shooting guard. He's had two strong showings in a row, combining for 37 points, 12 rebounds and four steals over that span. Jerryd Bayless played very well off the bench for the Bucks. In 22 minutes, he added 15 points (5-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and five assists, as he was very efficient with his time on the court. Bayless hadn't scored in double figures since the beginning of January, so it was good to see him turn things around on the offensive side of the ball and play well against a tough Spurs team. Zaza Puchulia added 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-2 FT) and six rebounds in 24 minutes, while Ersan Ilyasova finished with 11 points (4-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and six rebounds in just over 22 minutes.The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Tuesday.

												The Toronto Raptors (29-15) defeated the Detroit Pistons (17-28) 114-110 on Sunday at the Air Canada Center in Toronto.Despite being out-scored 31-25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons'  late comeback attempt and secure the four-point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one.After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 8-10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9-for-15 from the field and 2-for-2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double-double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7-9 FG, 3-4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively.With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12-for-20 from the field and 5-for-9 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season-high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9-17 FG, 3-5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double-double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double-double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7-11 FG, 0-1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he didn't have his normal eye-popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6-17 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 1-2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.  The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (36-6) defeated the Boston Celtics (15-27) 114-111 on Sunday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.Despite a fourth quarter comeback attempt where the Celtics out-scored the Warriors 34-25, the Warriors were able to hold the surge off just long enough to secure the three-point victory in front of their home crowd. The Warriors used their superior shooting to seal the win, going 47 percent from the field, while the Celtics went just 43 percent from the floor.  The Warriors' superstar backcourt of Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry did it again Sunday, as they were both nearly unstoppable. Thompson led all scorers, going 11-for-19 from the field and 3-for-7 from the three-point line to score 31 points in 32 minutes. This performance comes just one game after his historic 52-point outing on Friday, as he's now combined for a ridiculous 83 points in two games. On the season, he's pushed his season scoring average to 22.6 points per game. Curry on the other hand finished with 22 points (6-16 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 9-9 FT), 11 rebounds and two steals. This marked the fourth time in his last five games that he's recorded at least 10 assists. Curry and Thompson did receive some help though, as Andrew Bogut had a strong showing. He notched a double-double, contributing 13 points (6-10 FG, 1-1 FT) and 13 rebounds in 28 minutes. This was his first game since late November that he reached double-digit points, so it was good to see him get things going offensively. Draymond Green nearly double-doubled with 14 points (5-12 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and nine rebounds of his own.Jared Sullinger was the most productive player for the Celtics, finishing with an impressive 26 points (9-17 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 7-9 FT), nine rebounds and three assists. He's now pushed his season averages to 14.0 points and 8.1 rebounds per game on the year. Evan Turner did as much as he could to help Sullinger. Turner went 7-for-12 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also adding seven rebounds and seven assists. He's now scored in double figures in his last five games, despite averaging only nine points on the season. Both Avery Bradley and Tyler Zeller added 15 points apiece.The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday, while the Celtics will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Monday.

												The Washington Wizards (30-15) defeated the Denver Nuggets (18-26) 117-115 on Sunday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.With Just over a second left in the game, Kenneth Faried had an opportunity to put the Nuggets ahead of the Wizards, but went 0-for-2 at the free throw line, causing this game to go to overtime. Paul Pierce had a shot at the end of regulation as well, but Faried got a little revenge and was able to block it. In overtime the Wizards were able to out-score the Nuggets 12-10, securing the tight victory on the road. Ty Lawson had a chance to tie it up with just over a second left, but missed and gave the Nuggets their sixth loss in a row.The Wizards received a surprise performance from Kris Humphries off the bench, who finished the game with 21 points (9-13 FG, 3-4 FT) and 14 rebounds. It marked his first double-double of the year and a new season-high in points. John Wall notched an impressive double-doube with 19 points (8-16 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 16 assists. He's had a strong stretch of games, combining for 44 points and 25 rebounds over his last two. He continues to average a double-double at 17.2 points and 10.0 assists per game. While not doing much else other than scoring, Paul Pierce made his presence known and added 19 points (4-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 10-14 FT). It was a season-high in free throw attempts for him, as he was able to take advantage and score 19 for the second night in a row. Both Nene and Bradley Beal reached double figures as well with 14 points apiece.Ty Lawson and Wilson Chandler did most of the damage for the Nuggets. Lawson led all scorers with 31 points (10-20 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 8-8 FT), while also adding 12 assists and three steals. Lawson had to sit out of Friday's game for personal reasons, so it was good to see him come out right where he left off and have another big game. Chandler on the other hand finished with 20 points (8-19 FG, 4-9 3Pt) and nine rebounds, including a big three pointer to pull to within two points near the end of overtime. He's now averaging 13.8 points and 5.8 rebounds on the year. Jusuf Nurkic got the start despite dealing with a back injury, but ended up playing only 18 minutes and finished with six points (2-6 FG, 2-2 FT) and nine rebounds. With Nurkic playing a very limited amount of minutes, Darrell Arthur got a huge increase in minutes. In 29 minutes off the bench, he finished with 12 points (6-15 FG, 0-2 3Pt) and two rebounds.The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Monday.

												The Houston Rockets (31-14) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12-33) 99-87 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The Rockets came out hot right from the beginning Sunday, out-scoring the Lakers 52-36 in the first half alone. With such a huge lead at half, they were able to coast to any easy victory, securing the 12-point victory in convincing fashion. While the teams shot similar percentages from the field, the Rockets had a huge advantage from beyond the arc, going 30 percent from deep, while the Lakers shot a meager eight percent from the three-point line.James Harden continued with his MVP-like numbers, finishing with 37 points (12-20 FG, 4-11 3Pt, 9-10 FT), eight rebounds and five assists in 32 minutes. He has had an unbelievable four game stretch, averaging 37.0 points over that span. With Dwight Howard sitting out with an ankle injury, Joey Dorsey got the start at center, but really struggled to get anything going, finishing with only four points (1-3 FG, 2-2 FT) and seven rebounds in 25 minutes. Helping to ease the blow of Howard's absence, Josh Smith had a productive game off the bench. He recorded 11 points (5-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and five rebounds in 25 minutes. He's averaging 12.0 points and 6.4 rebounds on the season. Both Corey Brewer and Jason Terry reached double figures in points as well with 10 and 11 points respectively.The Lakers found most of their production from the bench. Carlos Boozer was the biggest contributor, going 9-for-13 from the field to score 18 points, while also adding 11 rebounds in only 22 minutes. It marked his seventh double-double of the year, but first since January ninth. Jeremy Lin was the other productive bench player. He struggled with his shot all night (2-9 FG, 0-3 3Pt), but forced his way to free throw line 14 times, converting on 10-of-14 of those attempts to put his game total at 14 points. He also chipped in with six assists as well. Starting at shooting guard with Kobe Bryant done for the season, Wayne Ellington had 13 points (6-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt) and five rebounds.

												The Toronto Raptors (28-15) defeated the Philadelhpia 76ers (8-35) 91-86 on Friday.The Raptors gave up 15 straight points to the 76ers to start the game. They succesfully dug themselves out of the hole ato take a 35-33 lead with 6:43 remaining in the second quarter on a Patrick Patterson three-pointer. Patterson was the Raptors' top performer, scoring 14 points to go with 13 rebounds, six of which came on the offensive end. In 30 minutes off the bench, he also recorded three assists and two steals. DeMar DeRozan has had a tough three-game stretch that is seeing him average just 4.7 points and 2.3 rebounds in 29 minutes. He finished Friday's game with only eight points and one rebound. Toronto is now 3-3 since DeRozan returned from a groin injury which he suffered on Nov. 28.The 76ers started hot but couldn't hold on in the end as execution was a major issue down the strech. The Sixers got some good rebounding performances as each starter recorded five or more rebounds and no Toronto starter was able to grab more than five boards. Rookie Nerlens Noel was the game-leader in the rebound category, hauling in a career-high 14 to go with 12 points. Down by three with 10 seconds remaining, the Sixers had trouble inbounding the ball, nearly getting a five-second call. When the ball was finally passed in, it wound up in the hands of Henry Sims, who air-balled a three-pointer from the corner. The ball went out of bounds to the Raptors and the Sixers were forced to foul Kyle Lowry. Lowry hit both free-throws, ending any hopes the Sixers had of notching their fourth home victory of the season. The 76ers have now dropped three straight and will face the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday. The Raptors will take on the Detroit Pistons on Sunday.

												The Hawks (36-8) rolled to their 15th straight victory Friday, handling the Thunder 103-93 at Phillips Arena. Atlanta fell behind 30-23 after the first 12 minutes but responded with a big second quarter, outscoring Oklahoma City 25-17. The Hawks carried a four-point lead into the fourth quarter, when they would break the game open behind an 8-0 run spurred by Dennis Schroder. Schroder scored six points and assisted on an Al Horford layup, as the run put Atlanta up 87-76 with eight minutes to play. The Thunder never got within eight points the rest of the way, and a Horford three-pointer with two minutes to play put the exclamation point on a signature win for the East-leading Hawks. Atlanta, which shot 48 percent from the field, was led by 22 points and 10 rebounds from Paul Millsap. Horford finished with 14 points and 12 boards, while Jeff Teague added 17 points and nine assists. DeMarre Carroll chipped in 13 points, and Schroder had 13 of his own off the bench. The Hawks registered 27 assists as a team and out-rebounded the Thunder, who lead the NBA in rebounds per game, by an 11-board margin. Oklahoma City got 22 points from Russell Westbrook and 21 from Kevin Durant, but only one other player, Serge Ibaka, scored in double-figures (13). The Thunder committed just 11 turnovers and connected on 10 three-pointers, but it was their interior defense that ultimately led to the loss. The Hawks scored more than half of their points in the paint (54) and shot 52 percent from two-point range. Up next, the Thunder head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Sunday afternoon. Atlanta remains home to host the Timberwolves on Sunday night.

												The Cavaliers (24-20) routed the Hornets (18-26) 129-90 on Friday in Cleveland.Cleveland put a whipping on the Hornets in this one-sided affair in which every Cavs starter regustered a plus/minus rating of at least 29. Cleveland put up one of the most dominant halfs of the season, outscoring the Hornets by 20 points in the first quarter and 15 points in the second quarter. All 13 Cavaliers who suited up played at least seven minutes and scored a field goal. Timofey Mozgov has been a great addition for the Cavs since coming over from Denver. He recorded a double-double in his third-straight game. Mozgov finished with 14 points and went 6-of-7 from the free-throw line to go with 10 rebounds. LeBron James led all scorers with 25 points, nine assists and six rebounds, and Kyrie Irving chipped in 18 points. Kevin Love finished with nine points (4-7 FG) in 30 minutes. The Cavaliers have now won five straight games, including three-straight at home.The Hornets had no answer for the Cavs, who held a 40-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. Charlotte was hot coming in, winning eight of their last nine games, but couldn't contend with the Cavs' great all-around performance. Cavaliers shooting guard J.R. Smith outscored the entire Hornets team from the three-pointline. Smith hit 7-of-11 threes and Charlotte was just 2-of-16 for a 13 percent shooting night from beyond the arc. Al Jefferson was Charlotte's high scorer with 22 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 15 points, and Bismack Biyombo finished with 10. Kemba Walker struggled mightily, conveting just 3-of-14 field goals for eight points.The Hornets will take on the New York Knicks on Saturday. The Cavaliers will play the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.

												The Heat (19-24) held on to beat the Pacers (15-30) 89-87 in Miami on Friday night. Miami opened the second half with a 17-point lead but allowed Indiana to slowly crawl back into the game. The lead was down to 11 at the start of the fourth, and a Rodney Stuckey jumper-plus-the-foul with 3:32 remaining trimmed it to just six. David West hit a jumper on the ensuing possession to cut the lead to four, but Chris Bosh responded with a mid-range shot of his own on the other end. With seven seconds to play, George Hill put in a layup to bring Indiana within one, and the Pacers sent Dwyane Wade to the line with six seconds left. Wade split the pair, giving the Pacers an opportunity to win or tie, but a C.J. Watson could not connect on a jumper as time expired. Luol Deng led the way for Miami with 23 points and five rebounds in 35 minutes. Wade, who was battling through an illness, finished with 13 points and four assists, while Bosh had 19 points on 8-of-16 shooting. Mario Chalmers chipped in nine points, and Danny Granger and Shawne Williams each had six off the bench. The Heat shot 48 percent as a team but made only 4-of-17 three-point attempts. Indiana didn’t fair any better, hitting just three of its 15 attempts from beyond the arc. West (12 points) and Watson (13) were the only starters in double-figures. Luis Scola was the high man with 14 points in 15 minutes off the bench, while Hill finished with 13 points on 5-of-10 shooting. Next up, the Heat travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Sunday afternoon. Indiana plays in Orlando on Sunday night.

												The Knicks (8-36) notched their third straight win Friday, knocking off the Magic (15-31) 113-106. The Knicks have been on a veritable tear since dropping a franchise record 16 straight games. They’ve knocked off the Pelicans, 76ers and Magic in succession and will have a chance to extend the streak to four games Saturday in Charlotte.  Carmelo Anthony led the way with 25 points Friday, adding seven rebounds and four assists in a game-high 42 minutes. Jason Smith chipped in 19 points, while Langston Galloway added 15 and eight rebounds. Tim Hardaway, Jr. was the high man off the bench, finishing with 13 points in 17 minutes.

They also registered 29 assists on 43 field goals. Orlando, which has now dropped four straight, shot nearly 51 percent from the field and registered 62 points in the paint, thanks in large part to a big night from Nikola Vucevic. The big man had 34 points (16-22 FG) and 18 rebounds, notching his eighth double-double of the month. Channing Frye added 14 points for the Magic, while Victor Oladipo had 15 (6-20 FG) to go with three assists and two steals.

												The Bulls (29-16) held on to knock off the Mavericks (30-14) 102-98 in Dallas on Friday. Chicago held a 10-point lead with just over four minutes to play, but Dallas would go on a run to close to the gap down the stretch. A Dirk Nowtizki jumper with 1:39 to play cut the lead to just six points, and a pair of Tyson Chandler free throws less than a minute later brought Dallas within four. After Taj Gibson split a pair from the line on the other end, Monta Ellis responded with a long two-point jumper plus the foul to bring the Mavs within two. Dallas smothered a Derrick Rose drive attempt with less than 10 seconds to play, but Rose was able to deflect the rebound out to the perimeter, and Dallas was forced to foul with 0.1 second remaining. It was the second straight big win for the Bulls, who blew out San Antonio 104-81 on Thursday night. The wins were much-needed after Chicago dropped six of eight games, prompting a closed-door team meeting. The Bulls were led by 20 points apiece from Jimmy Butler and Rose. Butler added six assists and eight rebounds to go with three steals. Tony Snell chipped in 10 points and Pau Gasol added 13 to go with a game-high 16 boards. Joakim Noah, who returned from a four-game absence, had six points and seven rebounds in 23 minutes. The Bulls were still without Mike Dunleavy, as he continues to sit out with an ankle injury. The loss snapped a three-game winning streak for Dallas after the Mavs knocked off Minnesota on Wednesday. Nowitzki led the way Friday with 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting to go with seven rebounds and a block. Chandler Parsons added 19 points, and Chandler finished with 10 points and 12 boards. Ellis had 17 points, while Rajon Rondo added a quiet six points and four assists in 27 minutes. The Mavs were out-rebounded 47-30 but committed only 12 turnovers and knocked down all 18 of their free throw attempts.

												The Spurs (28-17) cruised to a 99-85 win over the Lakers (12-32) on Friday in San Antonio. Coming off of an ugly loss to Chicago on Thursday, San Antonio jumped out to a 31-15 first quarter advantage and never looked back.

Tony Parker led the way with 17 points and four assists in 23 minutes, while Kawhi Leonard had 15 points and 14 rebounds. Tim Duncan added 14 points and seven boards in 20 minutes.

												The Chicago Bulls (28-16) got a much needed win Thursday, beating the San Antonio Spurs (27-17) 104-81 in at the United Center. Chicago entered Thursday's game after a gutting loss to Cleveland on Monday that had people questioning the direction in which the Bulls season was going. The Bulls started to pull away in the third quarter thanks to a solid combined effort from Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler, and Taj Gibson. The Spurs were held to just 37% shooting from the floor.The Spurs were on a four-game winning streak coming into this game and had won six of its last seven. Kawhi Leonard turned in another solid performance, putting up 16 points and 4 rebounds, but the Spurs were out of this game by the fourth quarter and no starter played more than 27 minutes. The Spurs will wrap up a back-to-back set Friday against the Lakers. Chicago needed to make a statement Thursday against one of the NBA's deepest and well-coached teams. The Bulls came out with aggressiveness on both ends of the floor and were able to out-rebound the Spurs despite missing Joakim Noah. Chicago plays seven of its next eight games on the road, starting Friday in Dallas.

												The Utah Jazz (15-28) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (21-21) 101-99 Thursday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Utah had an eight-point lead late in the fourth quarter, but Milwaukee stormed back to cut it to a one-possession game with seven seconds remaining. Brandon Knight had an open look with the clock ticking, but the shot rimmed out and the Bucks dropped their second game in a row at home. Utah entered the game having lost five of its last six contests, but was able to steal a win on the road in Milwaukee. The Jazz had a patch work starting five, with Derrick Favors missing the game for personal reasons and Trey Burke being replaced in the starting lineup for rookie Dante Exum. The rookie rose to the challenge, however, scoring 15 points and adding five assists. The Jazz are off on Friday before returning home to face the Nets on Saturday. Milwaukee has now lost its last two games by a combined five points but are still well-positioned in the top heavy Eastern Conference. Despite shooting 45% from the floor and forcing 22 turnovers, the Bucks were unable to secure the win on Thursday. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid game, adding 13 points, six rebounds, and five steals. The Bucks are also idle Friday before hosting the Pistons on Saturday to wrap up their four-game home stand.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (31-13) fell to the Boston Celtics (14-26) 90-89 Thursday at the Moda Center. With news coming down that star big man LaMarcus Aldrige will miss 6-to-8 weeks with a torn ligament in his thumb, the Trail Blazers got to see first hand how much Aldridge will be missed. Thomas Robinson got the start at power forward and performed admirably, scoring nine points and pulling down 12 rebounds. In the final seconds, Jared Sullinger had the ball knocked away, recovered it, and fired a pass from his backside to a wide-open Evan Turner, who buried a three from the corner to give Boston the lead. The Trail Blazer dropped just its fifth game at home.Boston is now 1-1 on its six-game Western Conference road trip after getting a surprise win over Portland. This win took a concerted effort from the Celtics starters, with Sullinger, Brandon Bass, and Avery Bradley turning in solid performances. Boston will have a quick turnaround as it will travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Friday. The Trail Blazers had one second on the clock to salvage a win over a Boston team that had lost twice as many games as it had won entering Thursday, but their inbound play was doomed from the start as they were unable to get a shot off before the clock hit zero. While rebounding wasn't an issue for Portland in Aldridge's absence, their offensive efficiency was a cause for concern. Portland shot just 37 percent from the floor and got very little scoring from Aldridge's replacements. The Trail Blazers will try to right the ship Saturday against the Wizards before embarking on a four-game road swing.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (29-14) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (18-25) in dominating fashion Thursday 123-84. This game was essentially over before the buzzer sounded to end the first half as the Clippers were nearly doubling up the Nets 70-37. Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan combined for 34 points and 16 rebounds in the first half and Chris Paul had 12 assists in the first two quarters as well. The Clippers have scored over 115 points in three of their last four games and shot a season-high 59% from the floor. The Nets came out flat after a 103-100 victory in Sacramento on Wednesday and were further flattened by a Clippers team that absolutely steamrolled them. Mason Plumlee was the only starter to score in double figures as they were held to just 37% from the floor, including 4-for-21 from beyond the arc. The Nets will look to shake this one off Saturday in Utah. The Clippers easily cruised to its third consecutive victory Thursday as they handled the Nets. Doc Rivers pulled most of his starters mid-way through the third quarter, giving valuable minutes to his role players.

												The Charlotte Hornets (18-25) defeated the Miami Heat (18-24) 78-76 on Wednesday.Kemba Walker shot just 4-of-17, yet led the Hornets scoring attack with a team-high 15 points in Wednesday's low-scoring affair. He missed the last two games with a knee injury but felt good in shootaround and gave it a go.  Walker also shot 5-of-6 from the free-throw line, all six attempts came in the final 1:14 and helped seal the win for Charlotte. 22 year-old Bismack Biyombo has had a good five-game stretch, averaging 10.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in less than 27 minutes per game. Biyombo came down with eight offensive rebounds Wednesday, helping his team to win the battle of the boards 56-41. He combined with teammate's Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for 38 of those rebounds. Two of Charlotte's biggest stars, Al Jefferson (groin) and Lance Stephenson (pelvis) have been coming off the bench since returning from injuries. Jefferson had 12 points and two blocks in 19 minutes, while Stephenson had four assists and three rebounds in 22 minutes.The Heat were playing from behind for most of this game until Mario Chalmers hit a three-pointer to give them the lead with 3:36 left in the fourth. However, it would be their last lead of the game as Kemba Walker and Marvin Williams hit some key free throws down the stretch. In the final 12, Chalmers and Chris Bosh each missed three-pointers that likely would have won the game for Miami. Chris Andersen started in place of the injured Hassan Whiteside, who sprained his ankle Tuesday against the Thunder. Andersen had four rebounds and three blocks in 20 minutes. Danny Granger was put into the starting lineup for Luol Deng, who was out with an illness. Granger finished with three points in 20 minutes of action.The Heat will face the Indiana Pacers on Friday, and the Hornets will take on the Cavaliers on Friday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (23-20) defeated the Utah Jazz (14-28) 106-92 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. The Cavaliers came out firing in this game, out-scoring the Jazz 31-20 in the first quarter alone. That set the tone for the rest of the game, as the Cavaliers went on to secure the 14-point victory in front of their home crowd, notching their third straight victory in the process. The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game, going 52 percent from the field while the Jazz went just 42 percent from the floor. The Jazz turned the ball over 20 times, which also made a big difference Wednesday. The Cavaliers starters all reached double figures in points, as the bench really struggled to give them any help. As a whole, the bench contributed only 12 points, although the Cavaliers were still able to come out with the victory. LeBron James led all scorers in this one, nearing a triple-double with 26 points (8-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 10-14 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. In the five games since he returned from his two week absence, he's averaged 30.6 points as he's been nearly unstoppable. Kevin Love also had a big game, recording a double-double with 19 points (7-15 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 13 rebounds. It was his second double-double in a row, combining for 35 points and 25 rebounds over those two games. Timofey Mozgov continued his strong play, recording his second double-double in a row. He finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. Kyrie Irving added 18 points (8-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 0-1 FT), while J.R. Smith had 15 points (5-16 FG, 2-11 3Pt, 3-4 FT).The Jazz received most of their production from Enes Kanter, who recorded a monster line of 24 points (9-20 FG, 6-8 FT) and 17 rebounds. He really struggled to get anything going over his last two outings, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Gordon Hayward reached double figures as well, finishing with 14 points (4-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds. It wasn't his best game of the season, as he was averaging 18.8 points per game coming into Wednesday. The Jazz did see some solid contribution off their bench though. Elijah Millsap recored 12 points (4-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), while Elliot Williams had an efficient 10 points (3-4 FG, 3-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT).The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday, while the Jazz will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Thursday.

												The New York Knicks (7-36) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (8-34) 98-91 on Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.The Knicks were the better shooters in this game, going 41 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers went just 37 percent from the floor and 35 percent from beyond the arc. The Knicks also out-rebounded the Sixers 52-43, even furthering their advantage in this one. For the Knicks, Carmelo Anthony came out firing Wednesday, scoring 27 points (8-24 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 9-10 FT), while also recording 11 rebounds and four assists. It was his fourth double-double of the season, while he's averaged 25.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game over his last three matchups. Jose Calderon had a strong showing of his own. He went 5-for-10 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 15 points, while adding seven assists as well. He had a very poor showing in Monday's game against the Pelicans, so it was good to see him regain some of his confidence and shoot the ball well.  In just his sixth game and second start of the year, rookie Langston Galloway had a solid day, filling up the stat sheet with 11 points (5-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 0-1 FT), seven rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block. The rebounds, assists, steals and blocks all either marked a new season-high or matched one from earlier this month. Coming off the bench, Tim Hardaway Jr. added 13 points (5-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) in 20 minutes. The Sixers saw most of their production from the duo of Michael Carter-Williams and Robert Covington. Carter-Williams had himself a day, finishing with 27 points (10-26 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-8 FT), six rebounds, seven assists and five steals. He's now scored 20 or more points in four out of his last six games, as he's the clear scoring leader for this struggling Sixers team. Covington on the other had finished with 17 points (5-11 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four assists. The four asssists marked a new season-high for him, as he's averaged only 1.2 assists per game so far this season. Henry Sims was able to notch a double-double, contributing 11 points (4-12 FG, 3-4 FT) and 12 rebounds. It was only his third double-double of the season, but second in his last three games. The only other Sixer to reach double figures in points was K.J. McDaniels who had 12 points (4-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 24 minutes. The Knicks' next game will be at home against the Orlando Magic on Friday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (35-8) manhandled the Indiana Pacers (15-29), 110-91, on Wednesday.The Hawks continued their winning ways, emerging victorious for the 14th game in a row. Every starter and Pero Antic scored in double-digits, with Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll leading the way with 17 points apiece. Teague himself tallied his second double-double in three contests, dishing out 11 assists in the process. Falling just shy of his first double-double since last Wednesday, Jan. 14, Paul Millsap recorded 12 points, nine rebounds, and one three-pointer on the night. Speaking of the trey game, eight Hawks got in on the act, but Kyle Korver drilled a pair to bring his league-leading total to 130. In Atlanta's attempt to avoid only their third defeat since Nov. 26, their next test is a bit stiffer Friday against the Oklahoma City Thunder.On the other side, Indiana's season-long scoring slump continued. Shooting 40 percent from the field and a miserable 20 percent (5-for-25) from three-point range Wednesday, nary a Pacer found his groove offensively. While starting point man C.J. Watson managed 13 points, four rebounds, and three assists, the frontcourt trio of Roy Hibbert, David West, and Solomon Hill combined for 20 points and 14 rebounds. Nevertheless, C.J. Miles topped all teammates, notching 18 points (7-15 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 27 reserve minutes.

												The Detroit Pistons (17-26) defeated the Orlando Magic (15-30) 128-118 on Wednesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.The Pistons had a very strong first half Wednesday, out-scoring the Magic 65-48 to give themselves a large lead going into the third quarter. While the Magic did everything they could to bring themselves back, they came up short in the end, as the Pistons held on to a 10-point victory. The Pistons shot slightly better in this game, going 52 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic went 50 percent from the floor and 40 percent from beyond the arc. The Pistons saw three players reach the 20-point mark in this one. They were led by Andre Drummond, who double-doubled with 26 points (10-14 FG, 6-8 FT), 17 rebounds and four steals. The 26 points matched a season-high, while it was also his third double-double in his last four games. Greg Monroe notched a double-double of his own, finishing with 24 points (11-16 FG, 2-2 FT) and 10 rebounds.  He's played very well lately, combining for 40 points and 30 rebounds over his last two games. Brandon Jennings was the third player to reach the 20-point mark, recording 24 points (10-21 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and a ridiculous 21 assists. His assists total nearly doubled his previous season-high, as Jennings found his teammates at an insane rate Wednesday. Both Kyle Singler and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope reached double figures as well with 14 and 10 points respectively. The Magic were led by the duo of Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic. Vucevic had a field day in this one, recording 26 points (11-23 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 15 rebounds. He's averaging 25.3 points per game over his last six matchups. Oladipo on the other hand finished with 23 points (9-18 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), five rebounds and four assists. It was his second straight night recording 23 points, pushing his season scoring average to 16.3 points per game. Coming off the bench in his return from an ankle injury, Tobias Harris had 19 points (7-15 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 25 minutes. He hadn't played since January 9, so it was a good sign for his ankle with how well he performed. Both Evan Fournier and Kyle O'Quinn reached double figures off the bench as well. Fournier had 14 points (4-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three assists, while O'Quinn had 12 points (6-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and three blocked shots. The Pistons' next game will be on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, while the Magic will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Friday. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Orlando,Magic,Little Caesars Arena,15,30,17,26,10.0,24.0,49.0,94.0,20.0,24.0,45.0,35.0,15.0,4.0,11.0,44.0,87.0,12.0,12.0,39.0,21.0,12.0,Kyle Singler,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,21,Devyn Marble,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,20,Greg Monroe,10.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,24.0,11.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Channing Frye,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,22,Andre Drummond,17.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,26.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,30,Nikola Vucevic,15.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,11.0,23.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,33,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,36,Victor Oladipo,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,18.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,34,Brandon Jennings,0.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,21.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,32,Elfrid Payton,4.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,29,Caron Butler,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13,Ben Gordon,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Jodie Meeks,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,24,Aaron Gordon,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Anthony Tolliver,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,33,Tobias Harris,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,25,D.J.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (30-12) defeated the Toronto Raptors (27-15) 92-86 on Wednesday.After losing the teams' first matchup on Nov. 19, the Grizzlies found a way to close the season series between these teams with a win. Marc Gasol lead the way with a game-high 26 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in 35 minutes. His frontcourt compatriot, Zach Randolph, finished with a double-double of his own, posting 19 points and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes. The Grizzlies won a rough game by holding the Raptors to 32 percent shooting from the field and 18 percent shooting from beyond the arc. Jeff Green moved into the starting lineup, replacing Courtney Lee, but Green struggled, posting just six points and two rebounds in 26 minutes.Toronto scored 24 points off of 13 turnovers, but it wasn't enough to overcome their deficiencies on offense. Kyle Lowry dislocated the ring finger on his right hand, but after a brief time in the locker room, he returned, finishing with a team-high 20 points to go with eight rebounds and three assists in 40 minutes. All-Star shooting guard, DeMar DeRozan was not himself, putting up just six points on 2-for-11 shooting from the field in 33 minutes. After starting the season on a 24-7 run, the Raptors have regressed, putting together a woeful 3-8 record since Dec. 30.The Grizzlies will fire up the barbecue for a matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers at home on Saturday, and the Raptors will rub down the meat when they play the 76ers on Friday in Philadelphia.

												The Dallas Mavericks (29-13) beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (7-33) 98-75 on Wednesday.Dallas lead by just five points after an Anthony Bennett dunk early in the second quarter. The Mavericks then pulled away and never looked back, with their lead eventually reaching 25 points in the third quarter. Chandler Parsons and Dirk Nowitzki were the only two to reach double-digits in points in this blowout over the Timberwolves, who own the Western Conference's worst record. Nowitzki scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 25 minutes, while Parsons poured in 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field in 26 minutes. J.J. Barea had seven points and ten assists in 22 minutes, coming off the bench versus his former team. Dwight Powell also came off the bench and finished with six points and ten rebounds in 20 minutes against Minnesota.The health and experience of the Mavericks was just too much to handle for the young Timberwolves. Nikola Pekovic made his return Wednesday night, after being out since the middle of November with an ankle injury. He came off the bench and had 14 points and four rebounds in 23 minutes. Gorgui Dieng, who took over at center when Pekovic went down, stayed in the starting lineup and played 25 minutes. Dieng had just six points and seven rebounds against Dallas. With trade rumors swirling, Thaddeus Young seemed unphased, putting up 14 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in 32 minutes.The Mavericks will play the Chicago Bulls (27-16) on Friday, and the Timberwolves will play the New Orleans Pelicans (20-21) on Friday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (21-21) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12-31) 96-80 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. While this game was very close at the half, the Pelicans went off in the second half, out-scoring the Lakers 53-36 to take the 16-point victory in front of their home crowd Wednesday. The Pelicans shot much better in this game, going 46 percent from the field, while the Lakers went just 36 percent. The Pelicans also out-rebounded the Lakers 45-41, giving them even more of an advantage. After missing three games with a sprained toe, Anthony Davis returned to the starting lineup and found himself having a very big game. He led all scorers in this matchup, finishing with 29 points (11-18 FG, 7-8 FT), eight rebounds, three steals and four blocked shots in 36 minutes. In the three games he's played the Lakers this year, he's now averaging an impressive 25.7 points per game against them. With Jrue Holiday out for likely the next two-to-four weeks, Tyreke Evans continued to take his spot in the starting lineup. Coming into this game, Evans had averaged 18.8 points and 5.8 assists during the four games that Holiday had missed. He only added to those totals Wednesday, finishing with 19 points (8-19 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and four assists. Notching his first double-double of the season, Eric Gordon recorded 17 points (7-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 10 assists. He was finding his teammates at a very high rate all night. The only other Pelican to reach double figures in points was Quincy Pondexter, who scored 12 points (4-10 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 26 minutes off the bench. Kobe Bryant returned for the Lakers Wednesday after being rested for the two previous games. He went 6-for-14 from the field and 1-for-5 from the three-point line to score 14 points, while also adding seven rebounds in 29 minutes. He's averaging just over 20 field goal attempts per game this season, so he didn't get off as many shots as he's used to. Jordan Hill notched a double-double with 15 points (7-14 FG, 1-2 FT) and 13 rebounds. It was his second over his last three games, pushing his season averages to 12.4 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. After not getting much more help from the other starters, the Lakers needed a little boost from their bench. Wayne Ellington was really the only one to provide any, going 3-for-4 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score 12 points in 18 minutes.  The Pelicans' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday, while the Lakers will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Friday. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,Los Angeles,Lakers,Smoothie King Center,12,31,21,21,,,,,,,,,,6.0,20.0,28.0,77.0,18.0,21.0,41.0,16.0,16.0,Dante Cunningham,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Wesley Johnson,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,28,Anthony Davis,8.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,29.0,11.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,36,Ed Davis,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,31,Omer Asik,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Jordan Hill,13.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,34,Eric Gordon,5.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,38,Kobe Bryant,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,29,Tyreke Evans,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,8.0,19.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,32,Ronnie Price,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,27,Nate Wolters,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,22,Carlos Boozer,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Quincy Pondexter,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,26,Jeremy Lin,0.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,20,Ryan Anderson,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,22,Nick Young,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,19,Alexis Ajinca,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Wayne Ellington,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,18,Luke Babbitt,,,,,,,,,,,,Robert Sacre,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (22-20) defeated the Washington Wizards (29-14) 105-103 in overtime on Wednesday.Oklahoma City was able to survive at the Verizon Center, thanks in large part to Russell Westbrook's layup with 0.8 seconds remaining in overtime. Westbrook is tearing it up right now. In his past five games, he is averaging 20.2 points, 9.0 assists, 8.4 rebounds and 3.0 steals in 35 minutes per game. He had 32 points, eight assists and eight rebounds against the Wizards. Kevin Durant finished with 34 points and seven rebounds. Durant and Westbrook sealed the deal in overtime, scoring all of the Thunder's points in the extra period.It was also a two-man show for the Wizards in overtime, with all of their points coming from John Wall and Nene. It wasn't enough to get past the Thunder as John Wall missed a deep three-pointer with less than a second remaining. Washington had won seven of their last ten, since losing to the Thunder 109-102 on Jan. 2.The Thunder will take on the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, and the Wizards will face the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday.

												The Phoenix Suns (26-18) took down the Portland Trail Blazers (31-12) 118-113 on Wednesday.Phoenix has now won eight of their last 10, including wins in four consecutive games. The three-pronged point guard attack of Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic and Isaiah Thomas continues to get it done for the Suns. Those three combined for 76 points on 29-of-53 from the field Wednesday. 33 of those points were put in by Bledsoe, who also grabbed 10 rebounds, six assists and three steals. Isaiah Thomas had 27 off the bench, hitting three three-pointers and dishing out four assists. The Suns still hold a three-game lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth-best Western Conference record.The Trail Blazers struggled for much of the game against the Suns. They made it a game late, but Bledsoe sank four free-throws in the final 10 seconds to end the Blazers' hopes of a comeback victory. Portland was short-handed with LaMarcus Aldridge out with a thumb injury suffered in their 98-94 win over the Sacramento Kings on Monday. Similiar to last year when Aldridge was out, Dorell Wright stepped into the starting lineup. Wright played 35 minutes and had 15 points, five assists and two steals. Damian Lillard played a game-high 41 minutes for Portland. Lillard and shooting guard Wesley Matthews each scored 22 points. Nicholas Batum was the man for the Blazers, though, putting up a personal season-high 27 points to go with 10 rebounds, five assists and one block. The Trail Blazers have now dropped four of their last five games.The Trail Blazers will take on the Boston Celtics on Thursday, and the Suns will face the Houston Rockets on Friday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (18-24) defeated the Sacramento Kings (16-26) 103-100 on Wednesday.The Nets were in control for much of this one. The Kings took a 5-4 lead early in the first quarter, and it was the only lead they'd hold all game, falling down by as much as 23 points late in the second quarter. In the second half, Sacramento closed the gap and made the score respectable, outscoring the Nets by 13 in the second half. However, it wasn't enough as Brook Lopez stepped up with a big game, putting in 22 points and blocking six shots in 38 minutes off the bench. Mason Plumlee started but got into foul trouble and only played 11 minutes. Jarrett Jack continues to be solid in place of Deron Williams (ribs). Jack had 16 points, eight assists, four rebounds and two steals. DeMarcus Cousins had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Kings. Rudy Gay continues to play well in spite on a knee injury, leading his team in minutes with 42. Gay scored 25 points to go with eight rebounds and six assists. Ramon Sessions made his return from a back injury that has kept him out since Dec. 22. Sessions had four assists and four rebounds in 22 minutes off the bench. The Kings could've used a little more from their bench, as they were outscored 51-18 by the Brooklyn reserves. The Kings will play the Warriors on Friday, and the Nets will take on the Clippers on Thursday.

Corey Brewer had his second best scoring output of the season with 20 points off the Rocket's bench.

Dwight Howard was limited by foul trouble. Howard had seven points and 11 boards in 24 minutes. Josh Smith was ejected after his second technical foul. He played just 14 minutes off the bench for the Rockets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (21-20) defeated the Miami Heat (18-23) 94-86 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.Down just 50-49 at half, the Thunder used a strong third quarter to build themselves a lead, out-scoring the Heat 23-17. After grabbing a solid lead following that quarter, the Heat were never able to come back as the Thunder secured the eight-point victory on the road in Miami. Despite being out-shot by the Heat, the Thunder out-rebounded them 42-36 and forced Miami into 21 turnovers, which turned out to be the difference in this game.The Thunder were led by their superstar duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Durant nearly recorded a triple-double with 19 points (9-24 FG, 0-8 3Pt, 1-1 FT), eight rebounds and eight assists. He also notched a season-high of four steals, as he did it both offensively and defensively for the Tunder on Tuesday. Westbrook on the other hand finished with 19 points (8-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) of his own, while also recording 10 rebounds, six assists and four steals. It marked his second double-double in his last three games, along with the third time in the last four games that he's recorded four or more steals. Reggie Jackson was a big bench presence for the Thunder in this game. He went a very efficient 7-for-9 from the floor and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 16 points in 25 minutes. Both Steven Adams and Anthony Morrow reached double figures in points as well with 10 and 12 points respectively.Like Durant and Westbrook of the Thunder, the duo of Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh had the most production for the Heat. Wade finished with 18 points (8-18 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and six assists, while Bosh had 16 points (5-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and seven rebounds. Bosh has been unguardable in his last three games, averaging 24.0 points and seven rebounds over that span. Wade sat out the last two games with a hamstring injury, so it was good to see him come back and play a full minutes load. The only other member of the Heat to reach double figures in points was Hassan Whiteside, who started at center and recorded 10 points and two rebounds. Whiteside is averaging 7.2 points per game, but has now recorded double-digit points in seven of his last eight games. Coming off the bench, Danny Granger went 3-for-5 from the field and 2-for-3 from beyond the arc to score nine points in 25 minutes.The Thunder's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday, while the Heat will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (27-16) defeated the Denver Nuggets (18-24) 109-99 on Tuesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Coming out of the third quarter up just 80-76, the Spurs had a fantastic fourth quarter both offensively and defensively, out-scoring the Nuggets 29-23 to secure the 10-point victory on the road. The Spurs were able to shoot 11-for-27 from the three-point line, while the Nuggets shot just 5-of-14, which may have been the difference in this one.After playing in only 23 minutes during Sunday's game against the Utah Jazz, Tony Parker returned to playing a full minutes load, finishing with a team-high of 18 points (8-16 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT), while also adding seven assists in 32 minutes. It didn't look as if he suffered any setbacks in the win, so hopefully he can continue to play without a minutes restriction moving forward. Kawhi Leonard had a very good showing. He went 6-for-13 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while recording 15 rebounds. The double-double marked his seventh of the season. Tim Duncan reached double figures as well with 16 points (6-10 FG, 4-4 FT). He had a season-low of five rebounds, but the Spurs were still able to secure the win. Coming off the bench, Aron Baynes had his second successful night in a row. He went a perfect 3-for-3 from the field and 9-for-9 from the free throw line to score 15 points in only 15 minutes. In Sunday's game he had 12 points and 11 rebounds, so he was able to stay hot in the victory.For the Nuggets, Kenneth Faried and Arron Afflalo did most of the damage against the Spurs. Faried finished with 26 points (9-17 FG, 8-12 FT) and 14 rebounds, marking his first double-double in the last four games. He only scored a combined 13 points over his last two outings, so it was a huge bounce back game for him. Afflalo on the other hand shot 6-for-11 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while adding three steals. He had only two points in Monday's loss to the Warriors, so like Faried, it was good to see him turn things around. Rookie center Jusuf Nurkic nearly had a double-double of his own, finishing with 10 points and nine rebounds. He's now averaging 6.6 points and 5.6 rebounds so far this season. The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was Wilson Chandler who had 11 points (5-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-3 FT) in 37 minutes.The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (17-25) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (7-33) 105-80 on Monday.Charlotte has turned their season around since the New Year, winning seven of their nine contests in 2015. While Kemba Walker was forced to sit out a second straight game with a knee issue, Al Jefferson returned from a nine-game absence with a groin injury. Jefferson played 25 minutes off the bench and put up eight points and five rebounds. Gerald Henderson scored a team-high 17 points, and Lance Stephenson handed out nine assists in 27 minutes off the bench. The Hornets sit just 0.5 games out of the final playoff spot in the East, and their next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday.Minnesota ran into the wall that is the Hornets' defense. After scoring 17+ points in each of his last ten games, including a career-high 31 points Saturday, Andrew Wiggins was held to just 12 points Monday, putting a stopper on the Timberwolves' most consistent weapon of late. Kevin Martin (wrist) remains on the cusp of returning to action for the T-Wolves, and Nikola Pekovic Ricky Rubio are nearing returns as well. Though it remains to be seen how Minnesota will deploy their rotation once healthy, as the team has publicly announced their intention to build for the future. The Timberwolves will return home to host the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The Wizards (29-13) took care of the 76ers (8-33) 111-76 in Washington, D.C. on Monday afternoon.Playing early in the day as the NBA celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the Wizards jumped out to a double-digit lead in the first quarter and never looked back. The advantage was 23 points at halftime, and Washington continued to pour it on in the second half, even with most of its regulars resting. The Wizards won every quarter and outscored Philadelphia 26-18 in the fourth en route to the 35-point margin of victory.Washington had seven players in double-figures, including all five starters. Marcin Gortat’s 20 points and eight rebounds led the way, while Nene added 12 points and six boards in 18 minutes. John Wall and Brad Beal chipped in 11 and 10 points, respectively, and Wall added 10 assists. Otto Porter scored 10 points off the bench, and Kevin Seraphin added 14 to go with nine rebounds. The Wizards turned it over 22 times as a team but were able to compensate with 56 percent shooting and a 53-30 rebounding advantage. Philadelphia shot a measly 33 percent from the floor and knocked down only six of its 24 three-point attempts. While Henry Sims (13 points) and Robert Covington (10) turned in solid performances, the rest of the starting five combined for just 21 points on 8-of-31 shooting. Michael Carter-Williams, in particular, struggled, scoring just seven points on 2-of-13 shooting. The Sixers have now dropped two straight since beating the Pelicans on Friday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (22-20) beat the Chicago Bulls (27-16) 108-94 on Monday.The Cavaliers are now winners of three straight games after dropping their six previous games, including a 95-92 loss to the 76ers on Jan 5. Kevin Love (back) started and had 16 points and 12 rebounds in 30 minutes after missing Friday's victory over the Clippers. LeBron James has been averaging 33.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.0 steals in 39 minutes per game since his return from back and knee strains, with the Cavs going 3-1 in that time. J.R. Smith has scored 20-plus points in three of his six games as a Cavalier. Smith has hit 20 of the 51 three-point shots he's taken since coming over in a trade from the Knicks.The Bulls are now 1-2 in Joakim Noah's absence. They certainly could've used him Monday, as they were outrebounded 54-40 by the Cavs. Rookie Doug McDermott was available after being out due to knee surgery since mid-December. The Bulls are now 5-6 in January after going 11-4 in December. They are currently leading the Central Divsion.The Cavaliers will take on the Utah Jazz (14-27) on Wednesday, and the Bulls will face the San Antonio Spurs (26-16) on Thursday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (34-8) held off the Detroit Pistons (16-26) to notch their 13th consecutive victory on Monday by a score of 93-82.This game got off to a rough start as the two teams combined for just 28 points in the first quarter. With star point guard Jeff Teague struggling, it was Mike Scott who became the latest unsung hero for the Hawks. Scott scored 20 points in 21 minutes off the bench. The Pistons' Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond combined for 38 rebounds but that wasn't enough to overcome the team's 35 percent shooting performance from the field. Atlanta has now won all three meetings against Detroit this year. Detroit entered Monday's contest as winners of four of its last five, but fell short against arguably the best team in the league right now. Greg Monroe recorded a career-high 20 rebounds and was a force on the offensive glass, helping the Pistons pull down 20 offensive rebounds as a team. The Pistons will return home Wednesday to take on the Magic. Atlanta now has a five-game lead in the Eastern Conference after recording its league-leading 34th win of the season. Jeff Teague turned in one of his worst offensive performances of the season, shooting just 4-for-15 from the field, including 0-for-5 from three point range. Despite Teague's shooting woes, the Hawks got solid performances from Paul Millsap, Al Horford, and Kyle Korver to help secure the win. On the injury front, reserve point guard Dennis Schroder played 18 minutes Monday after not playing Saturday against Chicago. The Hawks play their next six games at home with their next contest coming Wednesday against the Pacers. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,Boston,Celtics,Staples Center,13,26,28,14,9.0,21.0,39.0,82.0,15.0,19.0,44.0,27.0,11.0,12.0,29.0,33.0,84.0,15.0,21.0,43.0,24.0,13.0,Matt Barnes,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,35,Jae Crowder,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,13,Blake Griffin,9.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,35,Jared Sullinger,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,14.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,25,DeAndre Jordan,12.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,19.0,8.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Tyler Zeller,7.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,JJ Redick,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,12.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,31,Avery Bradley,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,22,Chris Paul,6.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,33,Evan Turner,10.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,29,Jamal Crawford,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,23,Brandon Bass,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Spencer Hawes,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,16,Marcus Thornton,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,26,Austin Rivers,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,15,Marcus Smart,2.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,31,Glen Davis,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Kelly Olynyk,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,25,Dahntay Jones,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Tayshaun Prince,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19

												The Los Angeles Clippers (28-14) defeated the Boston Celtics (93) on Monday 102-93.The Clippers were in position to shut the door on the Celtics with an 11-point lead with just over five minutes to go in the fourth, but Boston stormed back to within three points of Los Angeles. Boston went cold after their run as Los Angeles put the finishing touches on a nine-point victory. Boston dropped its third straight game Monday, which is not an ideal way to kick off a six-game Western Conference road swing. James Young missed his second consecutive game Monday due to an illness. Jae Crowder was held scoreless in 13 minutes on the floor, marking his third straight game with less than 10 points. The Celtics will resume their road trip Thursday against the Trail Blazers. Los Angeles has now won three of its last four games after defeating Boston on Monday. Chris Paul was held in check against the Celtics, going just 3-for-9 from the floor. Recently acquired Austin Rivers received 16 minutes of playing time, contributing two points and three assists. The Clippers will host the Nets on Thursday.

												The Golden State Warriors (33-6) dominated the Denver Nuggets (18-23) 122-79 on Monday at the Oracle Arena. This contest was over from the early goings, with Golden State taking a 27-point lead into halftime. The Nuggets had a six-minute scoring drought in the second quarter that put them too far behind to catch the sharp shooting Warriors. Golden State shot 54 percent from the floor for the second straight game en route to another easy victory.Denver has tailed off after its five-game winning streak and has now dropped three in a row to further hurt its slim playoff chances. The Nuggets offensive woes returned as they failed to score 90 points for the second time in three games. They will return home Tuesday to host the Spurs to finish up its fourth game in five days. Golden State rested its starters after this game was well in hand. No starter logged more than 25 minutes on the floor as eight reserves got into the game. The Warriors will take on a Rockets team Wednesday that they just beat by 25 points on Saturday. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Dallas,Mavericks,FedExForum,29,13,29,12,3.0,20.0,36.0,83.0,20.0,22.0,41.0,16.0,13.0,10.0,25.0,34.0,76.0,25.0,33.0,42.0,17.0,13.0,Tony Allen,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Chandler Parsons,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,5.0,14.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,35,Zach Randolph,15.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,40,Dirk Nowitzki,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,32,Marc Gasol,8.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,39,Tyson Chandler,16.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,39,Courtney Lee,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,31,Monta Ellis,2.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,18.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,39,Mike Conley,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,16.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,30,Rajon Rondo,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Beno Udrih,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Devin Harris,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,22,Jeff Green,8.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,32,Dwight Powell,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Jordan Adams,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,Richard Jefferson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,15,Nick Calathes,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12,J.J.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (29-12) fell to the Dallas Mavericks (29-13) 103-95 at home Monday. In a tightly contested game between two of the top five seeds in the West, Dallas got a huge win on the road against a Memphis squad that had won four in a row. Dirk Nowitzki took the game over down the stretch, scoring Dallas' final eight points to put the game on ice. Dallas has now won three of its last four games to move to just a half game behind Memphis for the third seed in the West. Monta Ellis led the way in the scoring column, pouring in 25 points while Tyson Chandler was dominant on the boards, pulling down 16 rebounds. The Mavericks will travel to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Wednesday. Memphis lost at home for the first time since Dec. 26 against Houston. Mike Conley returned to action for the Grizzlies after missing two games with an ankle injury. He logged 30 minutes of playing time and scored 22 points. Memphis will look to rebound from this loss Wednesday when a struggling Toronto team comes to town.

												The Houston Rockets (29-13) defeated the Indiana Pacers (15-27) 110-98 on Monday at the Toyota Center. The Rockets were led by a huge performance from James Harden, who lit up the Pacers for his fourth 40-point game of the season. Harden finished the game with a season-high 45 points, shooting 12-of-18 from the floor, 7-of-12 from beyond the arc, and 14-of-15 from the line. The MVP candidate also added seven assists and four steals. Indiana's struggles continued Monday as it lost its fifth straight game. George Hill was out yet again, marking his tenth consecutive absence. The Pacers have three more games left on their five-game road trip, with the next contest coming Wednesday against the Hawks. Houston rebounded nicely after being trounced by Golden State on Saturday. The Rockets are right in the mix for the third seed in the West, trailing the Grizzlies by just one game after Memphis fell at home to Dallas on Monday. Houston will have a chance to avenge its 25-point defeat at the hands of the Warriors when they square off Wednesday night in Oakland.

												The Knicks (6-36) thwarted a late comeback and held on to beat the shorthanded Pelicans (20-21) 99-92 on Monday evening. The win snapped a 16-game losing streak, putting an end to one of the most embarrassing stretches in franchise history. New York led by 13 points entering the fourth quarter but allowed the Pelicans, playing without Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, to slowly creep back into the game. With just over six minutes to play, Quincy Pondexter connected on a three-pointer to bring New Orleans within six, and a Tyreke Evans layup a few minutes later trimmed the deficit to just three with 3:13 to play. Following a Carmelo Anthony layup, Evans knocked down two free throws and hit a jumper to bring the Pelicans within one with 1:55 to play. After Anthony was called for a charge, the Pelicans could not convert two opportunities on the other end, and New York retained possession up one point with 42 seconds remaining. On the ensuing possession, Anthony kicked the ball out to Jose Calderon, who drilled a three-pointer with 32 seconds left. After Anderson misfired on a three, the Knicks secured the rebound and Anthony hit three straight free throws to ice the game.Anthony’s 24 points led the way for the Knicks, who shot nearly 49 percent from the floor as a team. Langston Galloway added 21 points and five rebounds, while Jason Smith chipped in 12 points. Amar’e Stoudemire added 14 points in 21 minutes off the bench.The Pelicans got 23 points from Evans and 20 from Eric Gordon but were simply unable to compensate for the losses of Holiday and, especially, Davis. While New Orleans out-rebounded New York by a 16-board margin, they blocked just one shot as a team and had just six fast break points. New Orleans has now dropped two of its last three after falling to Philadelphia on Friday and beating the Raptors in Toronto on Sunday.

The Raptors still hold the Eastern Conference's third best record.Brandon Knight was the only Bucks starter to reach double-digits in points. He had a nice all-around game with 20 points, five rebounds, five assists, four steals and one block in a team-high 41 minutes.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (31-11) beat the Sacramento Kings (16-25), 98-94, on Monday.LaMarcus Aldridge was removed from the game with a left thumb injury in the second quarter and didn't return. He had 10 points and two steals in 14 minutes before he exited. In Aldridge's absence, Thomas Robinson and Meyers Leonard had to pick up the slack. They combined for 14 points and nine rebounds off the bench to help out the short-handed frontcourt that is already missing Robin Lopez (hand) and Joel Freeland (shoulder).DeMarcus Cousins came back strong for the Kings after missing Saturday's game against the Clippers with an ankle injury. He finished with 22 points, 19 rebounds, and four blocks. Darren Collison turned in a nice game with 13 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists. After coming off the bench Saturday, Rudy Gay returned to the starting lineup and shot 10-for-19 from the field for 26 points. Ramon Sessions was available to play but didn't get into the action. He's been out since Dec. 22 with a back injury. Jason Thompson returned to Earth after recording his first 20-20 game in Cousin's absence on Saturday, posting just four points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes.The Kings will head home to face the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, and the Trail Blazers will travel to Phoenix to face the Suns.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (20-20) defeated the Toronto Raptors (26-14) 95-93 on Sunday.New Orleans found a way to knock off the Raptors despite being without two of their starters for a second straight game. Anthony Davis has missed two straight games with a turf toe injury, and Jrue Holiday has missed three straight games dealing with inflamation in his right ankle, the same ankle that caused Holiday to sit out most of last season with a stress fracture. Tyreke Evans has picked up the slack on offense. He scored a game-high 26 points Sunday. Evans was aided by superb play off the bench from Alexis Ajinca, who put up 22 points and six rebounds in 34 minutes. The Pelicans could get Davis back for Monday's game against the New York Knicks, but Holiday is not expected to play. They remain three games behind the Phoenix Suns for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.Toronto has dropped two straight games, falling to the Atlanta Hawks 110-89 on Friday before losing Sunday's game as well. After losing the first two quarters Sunday, the Raptors moved Terrence Ross to the bench for the second half and started Greivis Vasquez in his place. After sitting atop the Eastern Conference standings for the better part of the first two months of the season, Toronto has started to fall in the standings. They've dropped seven of their last nine games to fall 6.5 games behind the East-leading Atlanta Hawks.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (20-20) defeated the Orlando Magic (15-29) 127-99 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando.The Thunder got off to a really quick start in this game, out-scoring the Magic 79-45 in the first half alone. The Thunder were the superior shooters in this game, going 58 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic went only 40 percent from the field and 35 percent from beyond the arc. Only furthering their advantage, the Thunder also out-rebounded the Magic 54-33.The Thunder were led by Kevin Durant, who nearly recorded a triple-double with 21 points (7-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-7 FT), 11 rebounds and eight assists. The eight assists were a season-high for him, as he was able to get his teammates involved in the blowout win. Russell Westbrook had a solid showing as well, scoring 17 points (7-12 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and handing out six assists. He was well under his season scoring average of 25.1 points per game, but he only played 24 minutes, as the Thunder had a comfortable lead for most of the game. The Thunder received a big contribution from their bench, as three players reached double figures in points. Dion Waiters was the best of those three, going 7-for-9 from the field and 1-or-2 from the three-point line to score 16 points in 20 minutes. He's started to heat up lately for the Thunder, combining for 37 points and five steals over his last two games. Serge Ibaka finished with 16 points and eight rebounds in 27 minutes.For the Magic, Victor Oladipo did most of the damage against the Thunder. He went 7-for-18 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 23 points, while also adding five assists. He was able to get to the free throw line seven times, converting on all seven attempts. He's had the hot hand lately for the Magic, averaging  26.0 points over his last four outings. Nikola Vucevic was able to post some strong numbers. He recorded 16 points (7-19 FG) and seven rebounds in 26 minutes. He continues to be one of the Magic's focal points in their offense, as he's had at least 10 shot attempts in every game this season. Coming off a career-high of 22 points in Friday's game against the Grizzlies, Elfrid Payton posted another impressive performance, finishing with 19 points (9-17 FG, 1-2 FT) and eight assists. Despite averaging 7.3 points per game on the season, he's now averaged 18.7 points over his last three games.The Thunder's next game will be on the road against the Miami Heat on Tuesday, while the Magic will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (26-16) defeated the Utah Jazz (14-27) 89-69 on Sunday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.In this very low scoring matchup, both teams struggled from the field. The Spurs went 39 percent from the floor and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Jazz went just 33 percent from the field and 30 percent from the three-point line. The Spurs were able to take the advantage from the free throw line as well, converting on 19-of-23 attempts, while the Jazz made only 10-of-16 attempts. The Jazz also struggled with turnovers, as they committed 15 throughout the game.The Spurs were led by Tiago Splitter, who finished with 14 points (5-12 FG, 4-4 FT) and four rebounds in just under 22 minutes. He's only reached double figures in points six other times this season, so it was good to see him have a productive outing. Danny Green had a solid showing, going 5-for-7 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 13 points, while adding six rebounds. He's been very productive for the Spurs over his last three games, averaging 16.7 points over that span. Coming one rebound shy of a double-double, Kawhi Leonard posted 12 points (4-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and nine rebounds. After returning from an injury on Friday that had kept him out of the lineup for a month, Leonard recorded 20 points, so he came back down to earth a little bit in this matchup. Both Tony Parker and Tim Duncan played limited minutes, scoring four (2-5 FG) and 12 points (3-8 FG, 5-6 FT) respectively. Also coming off the bench, Aron Baynes added a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds.The Jazz just couldn't get in a rhythm offensively against the Spurs, as only two players reached double figures in points. Coming off the bench, Rudy Gobert led the team in, scoring 13 points and grabbing an impressive 18 rebounds in 28 minutes. The 18 points were a new season-high for him, while the double-double was his sixth on the season. Gordon Hayward really struggled with his shot, going only 4-for-15 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 10 points. After scoring 31 points on Friday, he wasn't able to have a repeat performance and scored well under his season average of 19.0 points per game. While he came one point shy of reaching double figures in points, Derrick Favors added nine points (4-11 FG, 1-2 FT), 13 rebounds and four blocked shots. This game was the first time in seven matchups that he didn't have at least 15 points.The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Jazz will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Wednesday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (16-25) defeated the Indiana Pacers (15-27) 80-71 in overtime on Saturday at the Time Warner Cable Arena.This game was marked by a combination of good defense and poor shooting as the final score would indicate. Both teams shot under 15 percent from beyond the arc and Charlotte shot just 30 percent from the floor overall. Marvin Williams hit a three to give the Hornets the lead late in the fourth quarter, but Rodney Stuckey answered with two free throws to send the game into overtime. The Pacers were held scoreless for the first four-and-a-half minutes of the overtime period as Charlotte pulled away.  Indiana let this game slip away as its losing skid extended to four games.  Roy Hibbert had a solid night with 12 points and 14 rebounds. George Hill is nearing a return and is expected to rejoin the lineup sometime during this five-game road trip. The Pacers will be idle Sunday before traveling to Houston to play the Rockets on Monday. Charlotte has now won six of its last seven games. Lance Stephenson, who returned to action Friday after missing time with a pelvic injury, played just 20 minutes but managed 13 points on 5-of-12 shooting. Brian Roberts got the start at point guard for the injured Kemba Walker, but produced just six points on 2-of-12 shooting. Walker is dealing with a cyst in his knee and is considered day-to-day. The Hornets will host the Timberwolves on Monday.

												The Detroit Pistons (16-25) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (8-32), 107-89. Since they waived Josh Smith, the Pistons are winners in 10 of their last 12 games and sit just outside the playoff bubble. The Sixers were without their leading scorer, Tony Wroten, for the third straight game due to a knee injury.Brandon Jennings followed up a 37-point outing with 10 points and six assists in 22 minutes. The Pistons were led by D.J. Augustin in assists (10), Andre Drummond in rebounds (15) and blocks (3), Jodie Meeks in steals (6), and Kyle Singler in points (20). Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 17 points, knocking in three of the Pistons' 15 three-pointers.The Sixers shot 7-of-28 from behind the three-point line, not unusual for the only team shooting under 30 percent from downtown this season. Michael Carter-Williams scored a team-high 15 points, but it was Larry Drew II who led the Sixers with nine assists off the bench in just his second game this season. Henry Sims provided a double-double (12 points, 10 rebounds) off the bench in 17 minutes.The Piston travel to Atlanta to take on the East leading Hawks on Monday. The Sixers will battle the Wizards in Washington come Monday in an afternoon matchup.

												The Atlanta Hawks (33-8) defeated the Chicago Bulls (27-16) 107-99 on Saturday at the United Center.The Hawks continued their winning ways on the road and have not dropped a road contest since Nov. 15. Atlanta had a comfortable 12-point lead mid way through the fourth quarter, but Chicago stormed back with a 10-3 run to stay in contention. However, Chicago was unable to get stops down the stretch as Atlanta took advantage of several open mid-range looks. The Hawks continued to show why they're the best team in the Eastern Conference and have now won 12 games in a row. More impressively, Atlanta improved to 14-5 against opponents with records of .500 or better. Kyle Korver was lights out from beyond the arc, shooting 7-for-9 from three en route to scoring 24 points on the night. On the injury front, Shelvin Mack left the game with a strained calf. The Hawks will return home on Monday to host the Pistons.Chicago has now dropped three out of its last four games, but remains securely fourth place in the East. The Bulls were without Joakim Noah, who has now missed two games in a row with a right ankle injury. Derrick Rose managed to play 37 minutes after logging 33 minutes on the floor on Friday. He led the Bulls in scoring with 23 points, but took 22 shots to reach that mark. The Bulls will take on a Cleveland Cavaliers team that appears to be rounding into form on Monday in Cleveland.

												The Golden State Warriors (32-6) blew out the Houston Rockets (28-13) by a score of 131-106 on Saturday. The Warriors led by just five points at halftime but opened a commanding 22-point lead heading into the fourth quarter.

Steph Curry and Klay Thompson scored 27 points apiece. Andrew Bogut returned to the starting lineup but managed just two points in 20 minutes on the floor. The Warriors will return home on Monday to host the Nuggets. Houston has now dropped all three of its games against Golden State this season.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (7-32) defeated the Denver Nuggets (18-22) 113-105 on Saturday at the Pepsi Center. Denver had won its previous two meetings against Minnesota entering Saturday's contest. Both teams were playing the second halves of back-to-back sets Saturday, but this game was not lacking in excitement as the outcome up in the air until the final minute. Mo Williams was clutch down the stretch, hitting two jumpers to extend Minnesota's lead to seven with just over 30 seconds to go.Minnesota improved to 2-1 on its current four-game road swing thanks to a big performance from Andrew Wiggins. The rookie ended up with 31 points and nine rebounds on the night. On the injury front, Nikola Pekovic and Kevin Martin are nearing returns from injury, but did not suit up on Saturday. Minnesota will travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Monday.Denver had a chance to further solidify itself among the teams in the race for the eighth seed in the West, but was unable to capitalize against a Minnesota club that had just six wins coming into Saturday.

												The Houston Rockets (28-12) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (18-20) on Thursday 112-10 in a game that wasn't nearly as close as the score might indicate.Houston got out to a fast start, taking a commanding 44-18 lead by the 11-minute mark in the second quarter. The Thunder cut the Rockets' lead to 10 early in the fourth, but Houston answered with a 12-0 run to effectively close out Oklahoma City. Houston ended the game shooting 47% from the floor, but was shooting above 50% for much of the contest.Oklahoma City came out flat after a long rest, having last played on Friday against Utah. Things won't get much easier for the Thunder, who host the Warriors on Friday before going on a five-game road trip next week against the likes of the Wizards and Hawks. Oklahoma City is now three and a half games behind Phoenix for the eighth seed in the West. Houston has now won both games against Oklahoma City this season, although Thursday's contest was drastically different than the 69-65 game in November where both teams shot under 30% from the floor. Point guard Patrick Beverley, who suffered a knee contusion Wednesday, was able to play 32 minutes and finished with 13 points and five rebounds. James Harden finished one rebound shy of a triple-double as he dropped 31 points, 10 assists, and nine rebounds on the Thunder. Houston will host Golden State on Saturday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (20-20) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12-28) 109-102 on Thursday at the Staples Center.LeBron James is showing no rust after sitting out for two weeks with knee and back issues. In his second game back, he put up 36 points, five rebounds, and five assists in 38 minutes on the floor. The only rust he showed was at the free throw line, where he was 8-for-13. Kobe Bryant, who turned in a tremendous game, was rested for a good portion of the fourth quarter and couldn't quite bring the Lakers back in the end. Bryant ended with 19 points, six rebounds, and a career-high 17 assists.   Cleveland's six-game losing streak finally came to an end Thursday as the Cavaliers improved to 9-11 away from home and got back to .500 overall. Kevin Love turned in a gritty performance as he battled through back spasms to play 37 minutes and score 17 points. The Cavaliers went with an eight-man rotation to keep some players fresh ahead of Friday's contest against the Clippers.   Los Angeles has now dropped five of its last six games, including three straight at home. Despite a great performance by Bryant, the Lakers were hurt by poor shot selection down the stretch. Nick Young was just 4-of-13 from the field and 2-for-8 from three point range. The Lakers will start a four-game road trip on Friday when they travel to Utah to take on the Jazz.

												The San Antonio Spurs (23-16) held off the Charlotte Hornets (15-24), 97-94, on Wednesday.One game removed from Tuesday's 101-93 road defeat to the Washington Wizards, the Spurs returned to the win column on the backs of its core. Manu Ginobili emerged from his January slumber, recording 20-plus points (27, to be exact) for the first time since Dec. 31. Tim Duncan also aided in the effort with a jammed-packed line -- 14 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, three blocks, and two steals -- which marked his second double-double in a row. After handing Tiago Splitter 29 minutes Tuesday, coach Gregg Popovich exchanged the Brazilian for Matt Bonner in the starting five, and Bonner responded with eight points, eight boards, and four swats. San Antonio will now return home for their next tilt in a pivotal showdown against a Western Conference foe, the Portland Trail Blazers.Charlotte's five-game winning streak came to a close during Lance Stephenson's first appearance since Dec. 17 due to a pelvic strain. Confined to a strict workload, he put up eight points (3-8 FG, 2-6 FT), two assists, and one rebound in 18 minutes. While Stephenson works himself into basketball shape, Gerald Henderson will remain the starting two-guard, from which he contributed double-digit points (11 in all) for the seventh time in nine outings. A usual suspect, Kemba Walker, led the way with a team-high 35 minutes, posting 28 points, three assists, and one three-pointer in the process. However, the Hornets' line of the night went to Bismack Biyombo, who tallied 12 points, 15 boards, and five blocks for his second consecutive double-double. In their upcoming contest Saturday, the Hornets are slated to take on the Indiana Pacers.

												The Orlando Magic (15-27) defeated the Houston Rockets (27-12) 120-113 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando.After ending the third quarter down 85-84, the Magic took off in the fourth quarter, out-scoring the Rockets 36-28 to seal the victory in front of their home crowd. The Magic were able to force the Rockets into 21 turnovers, which may have been the difference in this game.The Magic were led by Victor Oladipo, who went 12-for-19 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 32 points, while also adding six rebounds, six assists and three steals. He's averaging 32.5 points over his last two games, as he's taken it on himself to lead this team against two very tough opponents in the Rockets and Chicago Bulls. Nikola Vucevic was another huge reason for the Magic's succes. He finished with 25 points and 12 rebounds, despite being matched up with Dwight Howard, one of the most intimidating defensive players in the league. It marked his sixth double-double over his last six games. Rookie Elfrid Payton had one of his better outings of the season. He came one point shy of matching a season-high in points with 15, while also recording six rebounds and four assists. Channing Frye was effective as well with 15 points (5-10 FG, 5-9 3Pt) and five assists.Despite taking the loss, the Rockets had all five starters finish in double figures in points. James Harden led the way, going 10-for-16 from the field and 1-for-5 from the three-point line for a team-high of 26 points. He found his teammates at a high rate as well with 10 assists, while also notching five steals. The double-double marked his ninth of the season. Dwight Howard had a big game as well, finishing with 23 points (8-15 FG, 7-7FT) and eight rebounds. While he's known for struggling with his free throws, he made them count in this one, converting on all seven of his attempts. Uncharacteristically, Patrick Beverley was very impressive shooting the ball. He went 7-for-11 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 17 points in 34 minutes. Both Trevor Ariza and Donatas Motiejunas reached double-digit points as well with 15 and 12 points respectively.The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, while the Magic will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (19-19) defeated the Detroit Pistons (14-25) 105-94 on Wednesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.The Pelicans had a very strong first half defensively, holding the Pistons under 20 points in both quarters. They also got it done offensively, out-scoring the Pistons 58-36 over that span. The Pelicans were able to out-rebound the Pistons 47-30, giving them even more of an advantage and helping push them further to the victory.As has been the case all season, Anthony Davis did the most damage for the Pelicans. He went 11-for-18 from the field and 5-for-5 from the free throw line to score 27 points, while adding 10 rebounds and four blocked shots as well. He's been a force over his last two games, combining for 61 points, 19 rebounds and seven blocked shots. With Jrue Holiday sitting out with an ankle injury, Tyreke Evans moved back into the starting lineup, nearly recording a triple-double with 18 points (6-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-8 FT), eight rebounds and nine assists. He's had a strong three game stretch over this last week, averaging 19.3 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game. The bench also gave a nice contribution, led by Ryan Anderson with 17 points (6-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and three rebounds. The only other Pelican to reach double figures in points was Eric Gordon, who recorded 12 points and five assists.For the Pistons, the duo of Brandon Jennings and Greg Monroe were the most productive Wednesday. Jennings didn't have his best night shooting (4-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt), but got it done from the free throw line, converting on 9-of-10 to push his total to 19 points. He only had three assists though, which was his lowest total through his last seven games. Monroe on the other hand went 6-for-11 from the field and 4-for-7 from the free throw line to score 16 points, while adding eight rebounds and five assists as well. He came two rebounds shy of a double-double, ending his streak at seven in a row. Coming off the bench, the Pistons had solid contributions from D.J. Augustin and Jodie Meeks. Augustin had 13 points (4-5 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four assists, while Meeks had 11 points (5-8 FG, 1-3 3PT) and two rebounds.   The Pelicans' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday, while the Pistons will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Friday.

												The Toronto Raptors (26-12) ran away from the Philadelphia 76ers (7-31) in a 100-84 win Wednesday.In DeMar DeRozan's first contest since Nov. 28, when he suffered a torn left groin, he immediately entered the starting five and didn't miss a beat, supplying 20 points, four rebounds, three assists, one steal, and one block in 29 minutes. His backcourt mate, Kyle Lowry, again powered the offense, notching a near triple-double -- 18 points, 12 dimes, and seven rebounds -- while drilling four of the Raptors' 10 three-pointers. Reserve guard Lou Williams matched Lowry's four treys en route to 19 points of his own. Down low, Amir Johnson busted out for 10 points and 16 boards, marking his second consecutive double-double. Toronto will aim for back-to-back victories, and their third in four games, during Friday's matchup against the Eastern Conference-leading Atlanta Hawks.Falling for the second contest in a row, the Sixers ultimately couldn't keep pace with an intact Raptors rotation. Michael Carter-Williams did everything in his power to maintain a respectable result with a 29-point, seven-rebound, four-assist effort, but his teammates combined to shoot less than 35 percent (19-for-55) from the field. While Robert Covington was a late scratch due to a right shoulder contusion, the night wasn't all for naught, as both Nerlens Noel (12 points and eight rebounds) and K.J. McDaniels (10 points and eight boards) fell just shy of double-double territory. Upon their return to Philadelphia, the Sixers will face the New Orleans Pelicans for the first time this season.

												The Atlanta Hawks (31-8) defeated the Boston Celtics (13-24) 105-91 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston.The Hawks were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Celtics went just 41 percent from the floor and 33 percent from beyond the arc. The Hawks were also able to force the Celtics into 17 turnovers, while committing only 12 of their own, helping push their winning streak to ten in a row.Both Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll stepped up for the Hawks in this game. Teague went 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 22 points, while also adding six assists and two steals. He went a perfect 6-of-6 from the free throw line, adding a significant portion to his points total. Carroll on the other hand recorded 22 points (8-13 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 3-5 FT), five rebounds and three assists of his own. Considering he's only averaging 11.6 points per game so far this season, it was a nice surprise for the Hawks in this one. Paul Millsap had a strong showing as well, contributing 18 points (5-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 7-7 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. The double-double marked his ninth of the season thus far. The only other Hawk to reach double figures in points was Mike Scott, who came off the bench to score 11 points (4-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 22 minutes.Jared Sullinger and Avery Bradley, the Celtics season scoring leaders, again had the most production for the Celtics. Bradley went 6-for-13 from the floor and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc to finish with a team-high of 17 points. He's averaging 17.6 points per game over his last five matchups, as he's done the bulk of the scoring since Jeff Green was sent to the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade. Sullinger came one rebound shy of a double-double, recording 14 points and nine rebounds in 36 minutes. The double-double would have been his third in a row, but his streak ends at two instead. With the rest of the starters struggling to get anything going, the Celtics did see a few of their bench players step up. Kelly Olynyk went 5-for-10 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to add 12 points and eight rebounds off the bench.

												The Denver Nuggets (18-20) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (27-13) 114-107 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Coming out of the third quarter, the Nuggets racked up a 90-78 lead. The Mavericks made a run in the fourth quarter though, out-scoring the Nuggets 29-24, but their comeback came up just short and the Nuggets were able to secure a surprising victory in front of their home crowd. Denver shot much better in this game, going 50 percent from the field, while the Mavericks shot just 41 percent. The Nuggets also out-rebounded the Mavericks 51-39.Ty Lawson was a force in this game, going 10-for-18 from the field and 9-for-13 from the free throw line to score 29 points, while also adding 12 assists. The 13 free throw attempts were a season-high for Lawson, as he continually drew fouls on Maverick defenders who couldn't keep up with him. Kenneth Faried had a strong showing as well, finishing with 22 points (7-12 FG, 8-8 FT) and 14 rebounds. It was the fifth time in his last six games recording 12 or more rebounds. Wilson Chandler was the third Nugget to record a double-double, adding 15 points (6-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and 10 rebounds. It was his fifth double-double of the season. Coming off the bench, J.J. Hickson was able to provide a nice boost with the second unit. Hickson went 6-for-9 from the field to record 13 points, while also adding a eight rebounds in 21 minutes. The only other Nugget to reach double figures was Arron Afflalo, who finished with 12 points (4-11 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT).Despite the loss, the Mavericks saw a ridiculous eight players reach double-digits in points. Somewhat unheard of, all five players who came off the bench were included in those eight who reached double figures. Jose Barea was the scoring leader from the bench, scoring 17 points (6-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and handing out six assists in only 21 minutes. He was very efficient in his time on the court, matching a season-high in points.  Moving into the starting lineup with Dirk Nowitzki sitting out for rest, Richard Jefferson took advantage of the extra playing time, going 6-for-13 from the field and 4-for-9 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while grabbing six rebounds. Like Barea, it was a season-high in points for him as well. Chandler Parsons finished with 13 points (6-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt)  in 28 minutes. He's a combined 3-of-14 from the three-point line over the last three games, as he's struggled to hone in on his shot. Monta Ellis also had a brutal night from the field, scoring only five points (1-11 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) in 21 minutes. Rajon Rondo (Achilles) and Tyson Chandler (ankle) sat out with injuries.These two teams will play each other again on Friday in the second of their back-to-back, home-and-home series.

												The Golden State Warriors (31-5) defeated the Miami Heat (17-22) 104-89 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.The Warriors got off to an extremely fast start in this game, out-scoring the Heat 55-38 in the first half alone. The Warriors were the superior shooters in this game, going 47 percent from the field and 45 percent from the three-point line, while the Heat went 42 percent from the floor and just 33 percent from beyond the arc. The Warriors were also able to force the Heat into 19 turnovers, while only committing 13 of their own.The Warriors were led by their superstar backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, as they were the only players on the team to reach double figures in points. Curry went an impressive 11-for-19 from the field and 7-for-10 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 32 points, while also adding three assists and two steals. He's combined for 59 points over his last two games, as he continues to have the hot hand. Thompson on the other hand went 7-for-17 from the floor and 3-for-9 from beyond the arc to score 19 points. The Warriors had a solid bench contribution in this one, as they scored 41 points to help out the starters. Both Andre Iguodala and Leaondro Barbosa were the bench scoring leaders with nine points apiece.Chris Bosh and Luol Deng were the biggest contributions from the Heat in this game. Bosh finished with 26 points (8-18 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 8-8 FT) and seven rebounds, while Deng had 19 points (6-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-8 FT) and seven rebounds. Bosh was coming off a a very poor shooting performance (4-17 FG, 0-4 3Pt) on Tuesday, so it was good to see him have a bounce back game. With Dwyane Wade sitting out with a hamstring injury, rookie Shabazz Napier moved into the starting lineup for the first time in his career. He finished with 10 points (3-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and six assists, marking a new season-high in assists. The only other Heat player to reach double figures was Hassan Whiteside, who also moved into the starting lineup, and finished with 10 points. He added 12 rebounds, notching his second double-double in the last three games.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday, while the Heat will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings on Friday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (6-31) defeated the Indiana Pacers (15-25) 110-101 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.The Timberwolves came out of the third quarter down 75-69, but absolutely exploded in the fourth quarter, out-scoring the Pacers 41-26 to steal the nine-point victory on the road. Despite being out-rebounded 41-34, the Timberwolves went 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Pacers went just 28 percent from deep, giving them just enough of an advantage to come out with the win.Mo Williams was fantastic in this game and the biggest reason for the Timberwolves success, as he set a season-high in both points and shots attempted. Williams went 19-for-33 from the field and 6-for-11 from the three-point line to finish with a career-high of 52 points, while adding four rebounds and seven assists as well. After averaging 11.0 points per game entering this matchup, the 52-point showing was a huge surprise for the Timberwolves. Andrew Wiggins did his part as well though, scoring 20 points (7-16 FG, 6-6 FT) and handing out four assists in 35 minutes. Despite averaging 14.5 points per game on the season, he's now averaged 21.4 points over his last eight games, as he's really stepped up lately for the injury plagued Timberwolves. Gorgui Dieng was questionable coming into this game with an illness, but played and was effective, nearing a triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. With Rodney Stuckey playing in limited action off the bench due to an illness and George Hill sitting out with a groin injury, both C.J. Miles and C.J. Watson were entered into the starting lineup and ended up leading the team in scoring. Miles finished with 22 points (8-18 FG, 2-10 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds, while Watson scored 17 points (7-9 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and handed out five assists. Miles was pulled out of Saturday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers after only four minutes due to an eye injury, so it was good to see him back out on the court and getting a full games worth of playing time. In 24 minutes off the bench, Stuckey went 5-for-8 from the field and 3-for-3 from the free throw line to score 13 points.

												The Atlanta Hawks (30-8) easily handled the Philadelphia 76ers (7-30) on Tuesday, 105-87. Despite trotting out a less than optimum starting lineup, Atlanta cruised to an easy victory in Philadelphia. Al Horford led the way with his first career triple-double as he torched Philadelphia for 21 points, 10 rebounds, and ten assists. Over the course of his career, The Hawks are  46-14 when Horford has 20 points and 10 rebounds in a game.Atlanta rested three of its usual starters on Tuesday so that Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, and DeMarre Carroll could be fresh for Wednesday's game in Boston. The Hawks' reserves thrived, however, with big performances from Kent Bazemore, Denis Schroder, and even a double-double from Shelvin Mack.  Atlanta has now won 23 of its last 25 games, including a franchise-record nine straight road wins.  Philadelphia kept the game competitive early on, but was unable to keep up with the red-hot Hawks. Guard Tony Wroten left the game in the fourth quarter with a right knee sprain and did not return. The 76ers will travel to Toronto on Wednesday for the second half of a back-to-back set.

												The Washington Wizards (26-12) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (23-16) 101-93 on Tuesday at the Verizon Center in Washington.After ending the third quarter up just 75-72, the Wizards were able to go on a fourth quarter run, out-scoring the Spurs 26-21 to secure the eight point victory in front of their home crowd. The Wizards were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Spurs went 40 percent from the floor and just 31 percent from beyond the arc. John Wall led the Wizards, going 9-for-15 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 25 points, while adding eight assists and two blocks as well. He's recorded at least eight assists in each of his last nine games, as he continues to find his teammates at a high rate. Bradley Beal didn't have his best night from the field, but finished with 13 points (4-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT), five rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocked shots. He did a little bit of everything in this game, getting involved on not only the offensive side of the ball, but the defensive side as well. The Wizards received a strong effort from their bench. Kevin Seraphin recorded 17 points (6-8 FG, 5-5 FT) and eight rebounds while Kris Humphries had 10 points (5-10 FG) and eight rebounds of his own. Finally nearing a full games worth of minutes after coming back from a hamstring injury a week ago, Tony Parker got the start and led the team in scoring with 14 points (7-18 FG, 0-2 3Pt), while adding two assists in 30 minutes. Ever since returning a week ago, his minutes have slowly increased and this marked his first 30 minute game in his last five outings. Tim Duncan recorded a double-double, finishing with 11 points (5-14 FG, 1-2 FT) and 12 rebounds in 25 minutes. It marked his eighteenth double-double of the season thus far. Patty Mills came off the bench and added 12 points (4-8 FG, 4-6 3Pt) in slightly over 24 minutes. He still received a good portion of minutes in relief of Tony Parker. Both Tiago Splitter and Danny Green reached double figures as well with 10 points apiece. The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, while the Spurs will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday. 											",Washington,Wizards,San Antonio,Spurs,Capital One Arena,23,16,26,12,6.0,12.0,37.0,75.0,21.0,24.0,48.0,20.0,15.0,9.0,28.0,38.0,94.0,8.0,12.0,33.0,24.0,7.0,Paul Pierce,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,26,Austin Daye,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,7,Nene,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Tim Duncan,12.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,5.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Marcin Gortat,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Tiago Splitter,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Bradley Beal,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,13.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,36,Danny Green,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,16.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,33,John Wall,1.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,25.0,9.0,15.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,35,Tony Parker,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,30,Rasual Butler,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,25,Cory Joseph,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Kris Humphries,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Manu Ginobili,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,23,Martell Webster,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Boris Diaw,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,Kevin Seraphin,8.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Patty Mills,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,24,Andre Miller,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Jeff Ayres,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (19-20) fell to the Phoenix Suns (23-18) on Tuesday, 107-100Cleveland got their star back as Lebron James returned to the lineup after missing the last two weeks with knee and back issues. Phoenix looked poised to spoil James' return, however, as the Suns built a 19-point lead late in the third quarter. The Cavaliers went on an 18-5 run to close out the third quarter and cut the Suns' lead to six entering the final period. In the end, Phoenix and Markieff Morris proved too much for Cleveland.Even with James returning, the Cavaliers were unable to snap their five-game losing streak and are now under.500 for the first time since Nov. 24 when they were 6-7. James ended the night with 33 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. J.R Smith remained in the starting lineup and put up an impressive 29 points, but Phoenix held Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in check. Shawn Marion returned to action after missing Friday's game with a hip injury and posted six points in 22 minutes. Cleveland will continue its Western Conference road trip on Thursday when the Cavaliers take on the Lakers.Phoenix got a huge game from big man Markieff Morris, who had a season-high 35 points Tuesday. The Suns gained some ground on the Spurs on Tuesday as San Antonio dropped their game to the Wizards. Phoenix will look to build Tuesday's win when the Timberwolves come to town on Friday.

												The Golden State Warriors (30-5) defeated the Utah Jazz (13-26) 116-105 on Wednesday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.The Warriors were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three-point line, while the Jazz went 48 percent from the floor and just 33 percent from beyond the arc. While the Jazz out-rebounded the Warriors 44-31, the Warriors made up for it by forcing the Jazz into 17 turnovers, while committing only 10 of their own. Stephen Curry was very tough to stop in this game, as he went 10-for-16 from the field and 4-for-9 from the three-point line to finish with a game-high of 27 points. He also handed out 11 assists, notching his fourth double-double in his last five games. Over those last five outings, Curry is averaging 24.4 points and 10.8 assists per game, as he continues to have the hot hand. Draymond Green also had a strong showing in this one, scoring an efficient 15 points (6-9 FG, 3-4 3Pt). Surprisingly, he only recorded one rebound though, which was a season-low for him. Klay Thompson only shot the ball eight times, converting on five of those eight attempts. It was the least amount of shots he's gotten off all year, but he was still able to add 12 points. The Warriors really spread around the minutes in this game with nine players recording more than 22 minutes. Despite the loss, the Jazz saw three players record double-doubles. Derrick Favors led the charge, going 10-for-16 from the field to score 22 points, while adding 11 rebounds as well. He's had 20 or more points in four out of his last five games, as he's averaged  21.2 points per game over that span. Enes Kanter was another double-double contributor, with 13 points (6-13 FG, 1-1 3Pt) and 10 rebounds of his own. The Jazz received an impressive bench performance from Rudy Gobert, who recorded 16 points (4-9 FG, 8-11 FT) and 11 rebounds. It was arguably one of his best games of the season, as the 16 points were a season-high, and he also had a significant defensive presence with two steals and three blocks. Gordon Hayward finished with 17 points (5-11 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-6 FT) as well. The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday, while the Jazz will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Golden State,Warriors,Vivint Smart Home Arena,30,5,13,26,7.0,21.0,39.0,80.0,20.0,24.0,43.0,14.0,15.0,13.0,25.0,46.0,91.0,11.0,13.0,31.0,32.0,9.0,Gordon Hayward,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,17.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,31,Harrison Barnes,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,22,Derrick Favors,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,10.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Draymond Green,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,24,Enes Kanter,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,31,Andrew Bogut,8.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Joe Ingles,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,24,Klay Thompson,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,26,Trey Burke,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,14.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,29,Stephen Curry,2.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,10.0,16.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,29,Elijah Millsap,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,22,Marreese Speights,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,22,Rudy Gobert,11.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,16.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Andre Iguodala,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Dante Exum,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,22,David Lee,8.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Ian Clark,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,11,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,23,Elliot Williams,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2,Justin Holiday,2.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,16

												The Sacramento Kings (16-22) fell to the Dallas Mavericks (27-12) on Tuesday at the Sleep Train Arena 108-104.The Kings looked to be on their way to closing this game out late in the fourth quarter after surrendering just 10 points to the Mavericks through the first ten minutes of the period. However, thanks to some clutch throw shooting and an offensive foul from DeMarcus Cousins, Dallas was able to send this contest to overtime. Recently acquired Rajon Rondo drained the go-ahead three with just over a minute to go in the overtime period to give the Mavericks a lead they would not relinquish.Dallas snapped its two-game losing skid in a tight game that went down to the wire. Monta Ellis led the Mavericks in scoring with 28 points and he added 10 assists. The Mavericks have a quick turnaround as they will travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Wednesday. Sacramento had a chance to win consecutive games for the first time since late November, but came up short. The Kings weren't able to survive overtime without their best player, Cousins, who fouled out late in the fourth. Sacramento was also without Rudy Gay for most of the game after he suffered a sprained knee in the first quarter. He is considered day-to-day at this point. The Kings will have a couple of days off before hosting the Heat on Friday.

												The Miami Heat (17-21) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12-27) 78-75 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Down six with just over 30 seconds left in the game, Kobe Bryant knocked down a contested three-pointer to pull within three. After Wesley Johnson blocked Luol Deng on the other side, Bryant had a shot at another three-pointer to tie the game, but missed it as time expired, giving the Lakers their second loss in as many games. The Heat were the superior shooters in this game, going 42 percent from the field, while the Lakers went just 32 percent from the floor. Dwyane Wade started this game, but had to leave after only 14 minutes as he suffered a mild left hamstring strain. He still finished with four points, five rebounds and five assists. With Wade out of the game, Mario Chalmers took over, scoring 19 points (7-16 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-7), while adding eight assists and two steals. It was the first time he's reached double figures in points since mid-December, so it was good to see him show an improved offensive game Tuesday. Chris Bosh didn't have his best game, as he struggled with his shot and scored only eight points (4-17 FG, 0-4 3Pt). It was the first time in 21 games that he didn't reach double-digit points. Hassan Whiteside continued to impress, scoring 15 points (7-9 FG) and grabbing nine rebounds in 21 minutes. Over his last two games he's averaged 19.0 points and 12.5 rebounds, despite averaging only 6.6 points and 5.8 rebounds on the year. The Lakers didn't really have anyone standout in the loss. Kobe Bryant had a rough night, shooting only 3-for-19 from the field and 2-for-9 from the three-point line to finish with 12 points. He did have six rebounds and seven assists though, so that at least helped offset his poor shooting performance. Jordan Hill had 12 points (5-12 FG, 2-4 FT) of his own, while adding six rebounds as well. He was right on par with his season averages of 12.1 points and 7.9 rebounds. The only other Laker to reach double figures in points was Ed Davis, who went 6-for-7 from the field to score 12 points in 23 minutes. He also had eight rebounds. After recording only three points on Sunday, it was a nice bounce back game for him. The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Miami,Heat,Staples Center,17,21,12,27,4.0,23.0,29.0,92.0,13.0,18.0,46.0,20.0,12.0,2.0,15.0,33.0,77.0,10.0,15.0,50.0,22.0,18.0,Wesley Johnson,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,13.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,28,Luol Deng,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,36,Ed Davis,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Chris Andersen,8.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Jordan Hill,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Chris Bosh,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,38,Kobe Bryant,6.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,19.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,30,Dwyane Wade,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Ronnie Price,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,31,Mario Chalmers,3.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,33,Carlos Boozer,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Hassan Whiteside,9.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,15.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Tarik Black,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Norris Cole,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,19,Nick Young,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,19,James Ennis III,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,10,Jeremy Lin,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,16,Danny Granger,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,23,Ryan Kelly,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,22,Shawne Williams,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3

												The Boston Celtics (13-23) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (18-19) 108-100 on Monday at the TD Garden in Boston. After coming out of the third quarter down 76-72, the Celtics didn't look to be in the best of positions. With a huge fourth quarter though, where the Celtics out-scored the Pelicans 36-24, they were able to secure the eight point victory at home in front of their home crowd. The Celtics forced the Pelicans into 18 turnovers, while committing only 11 of their own, which may have been the difference in this game. The Celtics received most of their production from their forward position, as Jae Crowder and Jared Sullinger both had strong performances. Sullinger led the team, scoring 27 points (9-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-9 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. The 27 points were a season-high for him, while it marked his second double-double in as many games. Crowder on the other hand posted 22 points (9-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), three assists, four steals and two blocks. While the 22 points were a season-high for him, so were the blocks and steals, as he was a huge contributor on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball Monday. The Celtics did receive plenty of help from their bench as well. Marcus Thornton had 13 points (2-8 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 8-9 FT) in only 14 minutes, while Brandon Bass had 12 points (4-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT) in 23 minutes. Both Avery Bradley and Evan Turner also reached double figures with 10 points apiece. Despite the loss, the Pelicans received another huge performance from Anthony Davis. Davis went 10-for-23 from the floor to score 34 points, while also adding nine rebounds and three blocked shots. He was able to get to the line at will in this game, converting on 14-of-15 free throws. He's had the hot hand lately, averaging 28.7 points and 10.0 rebounds per game over his last three outings. Eric Gordon had arguably his best game of the season, going 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 21 points. It was a season-high in points for him, as he's dealt with injuries for a large portion of the year. Coming off the bench with Gordon back in the starting lineup, Tyreke Evans still had a strong showing. He chipped in with 19 points (7-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and eight rebounds, playing just under 35 minutes because Jrue Holiday was forced from the game after only 15 minutes with a right ankle injury. The Celtics' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets (27-11) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (16-22) 113-99 on Monday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Rockets had a strong start to this game, out-scoring the Nets 37-28 in the first quarter. Along with the strong start, the Rockets also secured an advantage from the three-point line, finishing at 40 percent from beyond the arc, while the Nets shot a meager 24 percent from deep. As has been the case time and again this season, James Harden took the lead for the Rockets. He went 9-for-13 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 30 points, while also adding six assists. He's combined for 60 points and 11 assists over his last two outings, as he's had the hot hand lately. Continuing to start at the power forward position, Donatas Motiejunas also had an impressive night with his shot. He went 8-for-11 from the floor and 1-for-1 from beyond the arc to score 18 points, while adding 11 rebounds to go with. It was his second double-double in a row and fourth of the season thus far. Josh Smith provided a decent contribution off the bench with 13 points (5-15 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT), six rebounds and two blocked shots in 27 minutes. Both Trevor Ariza and Patrick Beverley reached double figures in points as well with 12 and 11 points respectively.While they may have suffered the loss, the Nets saw another very impressive outing from starting center Mason Plumlee. Plumlee was extremely efficient in this game, going 10-for-11 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free throw line to score 24 points, while also recording 10 rebounds in 28 minutes. The 24 points were a season-high for him, while the double-double was his third in the last four games. Jarrett Jack continued to start at point guard with Deron Williams sidelined indefinitely. Jack scored 13 points (6-16 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and handed out six assists in 38 minutes. Over his last five games he's averaging 13.4 points and 7.6 assists, even with a five point performance against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday. Coming off the bench, Brook Lopez went 5-for-8 from the field for 12 points in 23 minutes. Kevin Garnett played only four minutes, as he was ejected after a scuffle with Dwight Howard under the basket. The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, while the Nets will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Houston,Rockets,Barclays Center,27,11,16,22,5.0,20.0,37.0,79.0,16.0,18.0,39.0,17.0,16.0,16.0,39.0,41.0,84.0,15.0,20.0,42.0,22.0,14.0,Joe Johnson,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,32,Trevor Ariza,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,27,Kevin Garnett,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Donatas Motiejunas,11.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,36,Mason Plumlee,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Dwight Howard,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Bojan Bogdanovic,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,37,James Harden,3.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,30.0,9.0,13.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,29,Jarrett Jack,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,16.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,38,Patrick Beverley,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,24,Brook Lopez,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Josh Smith,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,27,Mirza Teletovic,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9,Jason Terry,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,19,Alan Anderson,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16,Corey Brewer,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,26,Darius Morris,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,13,Joey Dorsey,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Cory Jefferson,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,24,Kostas Papanikolaou,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,12

Greg Monroe also finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes. Detroit has been red-hot without Josh Smith, going 9-1 since his departure. The one loss came against the Atlanta Hawks, who hold the Eastern Conference's best record.Jonas Valunciunas put up 22 points and 10 rebounds in the first half. However, he cooled down in the second half and ended up with 31 points and 12 rebounds. Kyle Lowry had a rough night with 10 points on 3-of-12 from the floor to go with seven turnovers.

												The Atlanta Hawks (29-8) defeated the Washington Wizards (25-12) 120-89 on Sunday at Philips Arena in Atlanta. After out-scoring the Wizards 34-22 to begin the game, the Hawks were also able to close out the game strong, again out-scoring the Wizards an impressive 33-12 in the final quarter to secure the victory in front of their home crowd. The Hawks were able to force the Wizards into 20 turnovers, while only committing nine of their own, which may have been the difference in this one. This win marks a league-leading eigth straight victory for the Hawks. Kyle Korver led the Hawks in scoring, going 6-for-8 from the field and 5-for-7 from the three-point line to finish with 19 points, while also adding four assists. He's now averaging 12.9 points and 4.2 rebounds on the year. DeMarre Carroll had a strong showing of his own, scoring 16 points (5-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and recording four rebounds and four steals. The four steals matched a season-high for him, as he was a big reason the Hawks secured such a large turnover differential. Al Horford contributed 15 points (6-12 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT), six rebounds and two blocked shots. He's had a very positive two game stretch, combining for 34 points and 22 rebounds over that span. Notching his second double-double in a row, Jeff Teague finished with 11 points (4-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), 10 assists and four steals. The Wizards had all five starters reach double figures in points, but they didn't do enough defensively to keep the Hawks in check. John Wall led the team in scoring with 15 points (6-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-3 FT), while also chipping in with eight assists and two steals as well. He did turn the ball over eight times though, which took away from his overall performance. Nene Hilario had 14 points (6-8 FG, 2-2) and six rebounds of his own. He's averaging 16.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game over his last three games, as he's been playing very well for the Wizards lately. Bradley Beal didn't have his best shooting performance, as he went 4-for-12 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line, but he still finished with 12 points, five rebounds and four assists in 34 minutes. Their biggest contribution off the bench came from Kevin Seraphin, who added 13 points, six rebounds and three blocked shots in 24 minutes.    The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday, while the Wizards will be at home against the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Washington,Wizards,State Farm Arena,25,12,29,8,16.0,31.0,41.0,86.0,18.0,22.0,41.0,32.0,8.0,5.0,16.0,35.0,69.0,11.0,12.0,36.0,24.0,19.0,DeMarre Carroll,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,28,Paul Pierce,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,25,Paul Millsap,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,24,Nene,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Al Horford,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,30,Marcin Gortat,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,19,Kyle Korver,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,8.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,31,Bradley Beal,5.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,34,Jeff Teague,2.0,10.0,4.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,27,John Wall,3.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,36,Pero Antic,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,18,Rasual Butler,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,21,Thabo Sefolosha,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,20,Kris Humphries,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Mike Scott,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Kevin Seraphin,6.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Dennis Schroder,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,14.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,20,Otto Porter Jr.,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Kent Bazemore,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Andre Miller,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

												The Miami Heat (16-21) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (25-13) 104-90 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Heat had a strong first half in this one, out-scoring the Clippers 62-53 to give them a nice lead heading into the third quarter. They got it done on the defensive side of the ball in the second half, allowing them to secure the road win. The Heat out-rebounded the Clippers 46-27, which gave them just enough of an advantage to secure the victory. The Heat's duo of Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were again a big reason for their success. Bosh led all scorers, going 13-for-20 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 34 points, while also adding seven rebounds. The 34 points matched a season-high for him, pushing his season average to 21.6 points per game. Wade on the other hand recorded 17 points (5-15 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 7-9 FT) and 10 assists. It was only his third double-double so far this year. In another surprise performance, the Heat received a huge contribution from Hassan Whiteside off of the bench. He went 10-for-13 from the field for 23 points, while adding 16 rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots in 28 minutes. He's received more playing time lately and has cashed in with four straight double-digit point performances, despite not recording one at any other time in the season. The only other Heat player to reach double figures in points was Luol Deng, who had 10 points (4-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt).The Clippers were led by Blake Griffin in this game. He went 10-for-19 from the floor and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 26 points. He's had a very strong week, averaging 25.3 points and eight rebounds per game over his last four games. Chris Paul also found a lot of success against the Heat. He nearly posted a double-double, as he finished with 23 points (9-17 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and nine assists. This marked the first time over his last four games failing to surpass the 10 assist mark. J.J. Redick was the other Clipper to reach double figures in points with 14 (6-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt) of his own. The Clippers bench had a very poor showing, contributing only15 points. They just didn't have the scoring balance to keep it close. The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Clippers will travel to Portland to play the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (26-11) defeated the Phoenix Suns (22-18) 122-110 on Monday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.After finishing the third quarter down 75-66, the Suns made a fourth quarter run, out-scoring the Grizzlies 35-26 to tie the game at 101 with five seconds left in the game, eventually pushing it to overtime. After Eric Bledsoe missed a game-winner in the first overtime, it went to a second, where the Suns went ice cold from the field and were out-scored 14-2 to close out the game. The Grizzlies were able to out-rebound the Suns 54-46, giving them a slight advantage in this one.In his second game back from a nine-game absence, Zach Randolph went off, going 11-for-16 from the field and 5-for-6 from the free throw line to score 27 points, while also adding 17 rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a season-high in points for Randolph, who also posted his second double-double in as many games. Mike Conley wasn't too far behind him though, nearly recording a triple-double with 25 points (9-18 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT), seven rebounds and eight assists. He's had a strong couple of games in row, combining for 44 points and 15 assists over the last two. Courtney Lee put in a strong performance as well. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 2-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 18 points. After struggling with his shot on Friday, it was a nice bounce back game for him. Both Tony Allen and Marc Gasol reached double figures in points with 12 points apiece. The Suns received their biggest contribution off the bench, as Isaiah Thomas scored 20 points (7-16 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 4-4 FT). He's continued to be a reliable option off the bench as he's averaged 17.0 points per game over his last five outings. Markieff Morris recorded the most points of the starters. He contributed 17 points (7-15 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), six rebounds and three steals before fouling out in the second overtime. He had an extremely poor outing on Friday where he went 1-for-13 from the floor, so it was good to see his confidence restored despite the loss.

												The Sacramento Kings (16-21) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (19-19) 103-84 on Sunday.Sacramento has won three of their last five games, finally starting to find some success following the firing of ex-head coach Mike Malone. DeMarcus Cousins led the way with a game-high 26 points and 13 rebounds. The Kings won the first three quarters and were up 59-44 at halftime. They turned the ball over just four times the entire game, taking away the Cavaliers' chances for easy points on offense. Cleveland has been active on the trade front, completing two separate deals in the last week to help improve their roster, but they've also seen their record worsen and are currently riding a five-game losing streak. LeBron James is nearing a return from his knee and back strains, which will give the team a talent boost, but talent hasn't been their issue this season, consistency has. Playing in the Eastern Conference gives the Cavaliers a lot of time to find their footing, as they're in essentially no risk of missing the playoffs given the depths to the depravity in the East. At just .500, Cleveland is still the sixth seed. In the West, a .500 record would leave the Cavs on the outside looking in at the playoffs.Sacramento will stay home to host the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, while the Cavaliers will continue their road trip against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (30-8) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12-26) 106-94 on Sunday.Portland is riding a four-game winning streak, and Damian Lillard led the way for them Sunday with a game-high 34 points and seven assists. Chris Kaman was given a fourth straight start at center with Joel Freeland (shoulder) and Robin Lopez (hand) out for the near future. Meyers Leonard did some damage off the bench, putting up 12 points and 12 rebounds in 19 minutes, aptly filling Kaman's bench role. The Blazers won the game almost despite themselves. As a team, they shot just under 40 percent from the field. Los Angeles didn't fare much better, shooting just 42 percent of their shots from the field as they collected their third loss in the last four games. Kobe Bryant was rested for the second straight game and the third time in the last four games. Bryant has missed six of the Lakers' last 11 games getting extra rest, but the purpose of the rest has been unclear. He's been rested on more than just back-to-back sets and has been rested more often at home than on the road. Wesley Johnson returned to action after missing the previous three games with a hip injury. He led the team in scoring with 17 points in 31 minutes. The Trail Blazers will return home to host the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, while the Lakers will stay home to host the Miami Heat on Tuesday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (15-24) defeated the New York Knicks (5-35) 110-82 on Saturday.Charlotte got whatever they wanted on offense. Kemba Walker finished with a game-high 28 points in just 28 minutes, and oft-derided big man, Bismack Biyombo scored a career-high 14 points to help grab a double-double with 12 rebounds in just 21 minutes. The Hornets have rattled off five straight wins with two of their starters out with injury. Al Jefferson remains sidelined with a groin injury that is expected to keep him out for about another three weeks, and Lance Stephenson (pelvic) has been perpetually close to returning for the last week but still remains without a clear return date. After sitting out their last game with a shoulder injury, Cody Zeller returned to action, playing 17 minutes as the starting power forward. Charlotte will return home to host the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.New York has lost 15 straight games with Saturday's loss to the Hornets. Cleanthony Early, the Knicks' top pick from the 2014 NBA Draft, made the first start of his career, putting up six points and two rebounds in 30 minutes. Quincy Acy led the team with 18 points in 22 minutes off the bench. The Knicks were down 62-31 at halftime and never had chance to come back. Carmelo Anthony is expected to undergo knee surgery at some point in the future, but president Phil Jackson said that Anthony expects to play in Thursday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. Jackson also said that the All-Star Game is important to Anthony, implying that the Knicks' star player is simply holding off surgery in the hope that he'll make another All-Star team in February.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (25-12) handled the Dallas Mavericks (26-12), 120-100, on Saturday.On the backs of 52.3 percent from the field and 13 three-pointers, the Clippers racked up at least 30 points in three different quarters, as every starter and sixth man Jamal Crawford scored in double digits. Chris Paul led the offensive with 17 points (5-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and 13 dimes, while DeAndre Jordan chipped in a double-double (13 points and 15 rebounds), but Blake Griffin's continued commitment to distribution can't be ignored. After dishing six assists Saturday, Griffin is averaging nearly six per game since Dec. 1, which is supplementing his usual stat-laden line. The Clippers have now cobbled together back-to-back wins, and victories in five of the past six games, which they'll attempt to uphold in Sunday's showdown against the Heat.On the other side, Dallas has dropped two contests in a row, after tallying a six-game winning streak, but their primary scoring threats didn't disappoint. Dirk Nowitzki, the NBA's seventh-leading scorer all-time, supplied 25 points (10-19 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT), six rebounds, and one assist in 30 minutes. Meanwhile, Monta Ellis drilled four treys of his own en route to 23 points, six assists, four rebounds, and one steal. The remaining Mavericks fired at a 37 percent clip (19-for-52), though, which wasn't enough against the Clippers' hot hand. Dallas' next opportunity to turn to the prevailing tide arrives Tuesday in Sacramento versus a Kings squad that has lost two of the last three outings.

												The Detroit Pistons (13-24) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (16-21), 98-93. The Pistons pulled to within two and half games of the final playoff seed in the Eastern Conference and avoided the season sweep at the hands of the Nets.After a scoreless first half, Brandon Jennings changed his sneakers and scored 20 second-half points. He added 11 assists, three rebounds, two steals, and three three-pointers while committing one turnover. Greg Monroe also double-doubled (16 points, 17 rebounds), and Andre Drummond provided 14 points, nine rebounds, two blocks, and one steal in 28 minutes.Coach Lionel Hollins replaced Sergey Karasev with Bojan Bogdanovic in the starting lineup. Bogdanovic responded with 14 points in his first start since December 8th. Kevin Garnett returned to the starting lineup after resting one game, relegating Brook Lopez to a reserve role.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (6-29) defeated the Indiana Pacers (15-23), 93-92, in a back-and-forth affair Saturday.Facing a six-point deficit at halftime, the Sixers set themselves up for victory by outscoring the Pacers, 29-21, in the third quarter, and Michael Carter-Williams brushed off a poor shooting night, driving for a layup with nine seconds remaining for the game winner. Putting his 6-for-17 performance from the field aside, he posted 15 points, nine assists, five rebounds, and one block. Tony Wroten nearly matched Carter-Williams off the bench, recording 20 points (6-17 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 6-7 FT), nine dimes, four rebounds, and two steals. Prior to the opening tip, coach Brett Brown exchanged Henry Sims for K.J. McDaniels in the starting five, and the latter responded with a modest 10 points, three rebounds, two blocks, and one assist in 33 minutes. The Sixers will next take the court Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves.Meanwhile, the Pacers' bottom-tier offense upheld the standard set this season, hitting only 33 percent from the field, including a disastrous 4-for-18 from three-point range. David West led the way with 28 points and nine rebounds, but after putting his side ahead with a 12-foot jumper with 17.6 seconds remaining, his evening ended with a missed 13-footer as the final horn sounded. His frontcourt mate, Roy Hibbert, only garnered 19 minutes one night removed from logging 35 on a sprained ankle. The reduced run didn't afflict his output, though, as he accrued seven points, 13 rebounds, and two blocks. On the injury front, C.J. Miles left for good after suffering an eye abrasion with 42 seconds left in the first quarter, which allowed starting shooting guard Rodney Stuckey to pick up more minutes (35) than his typical 27 per game. As the Pacers return to Indiana for Tuesday's tilt against the Atlanta Hawks, George Hill will attempt to return from a six-game absence due to a sore left groin.

												The Toronto Raptors (25-11) defeated the Boston Celtics (12-23) 109-96 on Saturday at the Air Canada Centre. The Celtics had a nine-point lead in the second quarter evaporate when Toronto went on a 16-3 run to end the first half. Toronto dominated the paint throughout the night, outscoring Boston 54-42 in that area and had 10 blocks compared to Boston's three. The Raptors also had an impressive shooting performance from three-point range, shooting 43.3% from beyond the arc. Boston lost its second game in as many nights after a tough 107-103 loss in overtime on Friday night at Indiana. Jae Crowder got the start again at small forward, but managed just seven points and three rebounds in 22 minutes of action. The Celtics begin a three-game homestand on Monday when they take on the Pelicans. Toronto snapped its four-game losing streak Saturday night with solid performances from the likes of Kyle Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas. James Johnson, who got the start over Landry Fields, posted a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Fields did not receive any playing time against the Celtics. Toronto will host Detroit on Monday in the third installment of a six-game homestand.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (5-31) dropped their 15th consecutive game Saturday, losing 108-93 to the San Antonio Spurs (23-15) at home. Both teams were playing their second games in as many nights on Saturday, with the Timberwolves coming off of a 98-84 loss to the Bucks while the Spurs were coming off of a 100-95 win over the Suns. Each team made heavy use of their bench players as both of them had three reserves play 20+ minutes. The Spurs opened up a big lead in the second quarter thanks to a 13-0 run that was highlighted by seven points from Austin Daye. The Spurs shot an excellent 48.8% from the field Saturday night en route to an easy victory. San Antonio remains the seventh seed in the West after recording their second consecutive win on Saturday. The Spurs fielded a patchwork starting lineup with Manu Ginobli and Marco Belinelli sidelined with injuries. Austin Daye filled in admirably with 22 points and 10 rebounds, however. The Spurs will travel to Washington to take on the Wizards on Monday. Minnesota was dealing with injury issues as well with Shabazz Muhammad sidelined with an abdomen injury. The Timberwolves will start a four-game road trip on Tuesday when they take on the Pacers.

												The Houston Rockets (26-11) cruised during Saturday's 97-82 victory against the Utah Jazz (13-25).Houston entered the contest with a previously-unknown quandary, but Dwight Howard brushed aside a minor knee injury to earn a game-high 37 minutes. While his double-double streak ended at four outings, he still managed to tally eight points, eight rebounds, one block, and one assist. The bulk of the offense came from a familiar source, James Harden, who recorded his 15th 30-point game of the season to uphold his status as the NBA's leading scorer. By drilling four of the Rockets' 13 three-pointers, he's now hit multiple treys in five consecutive contests -- and 28 of 37 games this season -- en route to 26.8 points per outing. Even Donatas Motiejunas got in on the act, knocking down one trey, but more important was his third double-double of 2014-15 (14 points, 10 boards, and three steals in 36 minutes). On Monday, the Rockets return to the East Coast to take on the Brooklyn Nets, with an eye on extending their winning streak to four games.After Wednesday's impressive win in Chicago, the Jazz have suffered back-to-back defeats, and the primary culprit has been a combined 47 turnovers, including 27 on Saturday. On a positive note, the frontcourt welcomed back Enes Kanter following a four-game absence due to a sprained ankle, and the big man responded with 16 points, six rebounds, and one steal in only 21 minutes. The presence of Kanter didn't push Rudy Gobert back to the bench (yet). However, the Frenchman upheld his workload from Kanter's stay on the sideline, racking up four points, five boards, three assists, three blocks, and one steal in 35 minutes. By the final horn, the Jazz had shot merely 41 percent from the field, but no one contributed to the mark more than Gordon Hayward, who put up an ordinary nine points on 2-for-10 shooting. Upon returning to Utah, the Jazz will attempt to press the reset button in their next outing, Tuesday versus the Golden State Warriors.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (6-29) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (16-20) 90-88 on Friday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.After coming out of the third quarter down 71-64, the Sixers were able to out-score the Nets 26-17 in the fourth quarter to steal a two-point victory on the road. Brook Lopez was able to tie the game at 88 with 25 seconds to go, but Nerlens Noel came back with a clutch jumper of his own, giving the Sixers the go-ahead bucket with just three seconds left in the game. Brook Lopez heaved a three-point shot at the buzzer but missed, giving the Sixers a rare win. The Sixers secured a large three-point advantage in this game, going 47 percent from beyond the arc, while the Nets went just 19 percent from deep.Back in the starting lineup, Robert Covington led the Sixers with 20 points (8-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT), while also adding seven rebounds and six steals. After a brutal showing on Wednesday against the Bucks, it was a nice bounce back game for him. The six steals were also a season-high, as he was productive on both sides of the ball Friday. Luc Mbah a Moute had a solid showing, going 6-for-10 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 16 points. He missed the previous two outings with a toe injury, so it was a very positive showing for him in his return. In addition to his go-ahead jumper to take the lead in the final seconds, Noel added 12 points (6-10 FG), five rebounds and two blocked shots. He's combined for 25 points over his last two games, showing some improvement offensively. The only other Sixer to reach double figures in points was Tony Wroten, who came off the bench for 12 points (5-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and four assists in 28 minutes.Back in the starting lineup due to Kevin Garnett sitting out with injury, Brook Lopez had a big impact for the Nets. He finished with 18 points (9-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 0-1 FT), six rebounds and two blocked shots in 28 minutes. He continues to have a defensive presence, as he's had at least two blocks in his last three games. With Deron Williams out indefinitely, Jarrrett Jack remained the starting point guard. He notched a double-double, recording 14 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and 10 assists. It was his second double-double in the last three games, as he continues to excel as a member of the starting lineup. Mason Plumlee had a double-double of his own with 15 points (5-9 FG, 5-8 FT) and 15 rebounds. Even with Lopez's entrance in the starting lineup, Plumlee was able to stay a hound on the boards. Joe Johnson didn't have his best night offensively, scoring only 13 points (4-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 37 minutes.The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Saturday.

												The Hawks (28-8) put an end to the Pistons’ (12-24) seven-game winning streak Friday, holding on for a 106-101 victory at home. Atlanta got off to a hot start, jumping out to a nine-point lead after the first quarter. The lead reached 19 points at the half, as the Hawks outscored Detroit 33-23 in the second quarter. Detroit was able to chip away at the deficit in third but still trailed by 15 entering the final period. The Pistons began the fourth on a 9-3 run spurred by back-to-back threes from Anthony Tolliver and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.  Atlanta responded, pushing the lad back to 14 points, but Caldwell-Pope answered back with seven consecutive points, and a pair of Greg Monroe free throws trimmed the deficit to just seven points with 2:35 remaining. Kyle Korver drilled a three-pointer to put the Hawks up 105-95 but Caldwell-Pope answered back again, converting back-to-back threes and brining Detroit back to within four. Following a DeMarre Carroll miss, the Pistons were unable to convert on the other end, and Atlanta controlled the rebound and salted the game away at the free throw line. The Hawks, who shot nearly 49 percent from the floor, placed all five starters in double-figures, paced by 19 points and 16 rebounds from Al Horford. Paul Millsap added 17 points, and Korver finished with 11 points (3-3 3Pt). Thabo Sefolosha added 12 points off the bench in 15 minutes. Detroit was led by 20 from Caldwell-Pope, who converted just 4-of-15 three-point attempts. Brandon Jennings added 14 points (6-14 FG), and Kyle Singler and Greg Monroe chipped in 16 and 15 points apiece. Monroe also added 12 rebounds. Andre Drummond was limited to just four points and five rebounds in 17 minutes, despite not being in foul trouble.

												The Pelicans (18-18) knocked off the Grizzlies (25-11) 106-95 in New Orleans on Friday. New Orleans jumped out to a 31-19 advantage after the first quarter and never looked back, as the lead did not dip below seven points in the second half. The victory was key for a Pelicans team fighting to stay in playoff contention after dropping two straight to Washington and Charlotte. On a relatively quiet night for Anthony Davis – 20 points, nine rebounds – the Pelicans got contributions off the bench from Tyreke Evans and Ryan Anderson. Evans finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, while Anderson added 20 points, including four three-pointers, to go with six rebounds. Jrue Holiday led all scorers with 23 points in 36 minutes. The Pelicans shot 45.7 percent from the floor and knocked down 10-of-20 three-point attempts. Memphis, which has now dropped two straight and three of its last four, shot 44 percent from the floor, converting only 6-of-17 attempts from beyond the arc. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley led the way with 19 points apiece, and Zach Randolph, who returned from injury after missing nine games, was the only other Grizzlies player in double-figures, finishing with 11 points and 11 boards in 31 minutes. Up next, Memphis returns home to host the Suns on Sunday. New Orleans, meanwhile, heads north to Boston to take on the Celtics on Monday night.

												The Thunder (18-19) held on to knock off the Jazz (13-24) behind 32 points from Kevin Durant on Friday. Oklahoma City trailed by as much as seven midway through the fourth quarter, but Durant and Westbrook stepped up down the stretch, scoring eight straight points in less than two minutes to put the Thunder up 92-90 with 2:54 to play. Following a Derrick Favors free throw, Westbrook fed Dion Waiters for a dunk to bring the Oklahoma City lead to three. Then, with the Thunder leading by one with 23 seconds to play, Durant found Waiters for a three-pointer that would prove to be the dagger. In his second game with the Thunder, Waiters finished with 15 points and four steals in 27 minutes off the bench. Westbrook had 25 points and 12 assists, and Durant poured in 32 points to go with six assists and five boards. Serge Ibaka was the only other Thunder player in double-figures, finishing with 12 points in 32 minutes. Utah was paced by 27 points from Gordon Hayward and 20 from Trey Burke. Favors added 22 points to go with 11 rebounds, and Trevor Booker chipped in eight points and nine rebounds off the bench. Rudy Gobert, who continues to start in place of the injured Enes Kanter, scored just four points but had seven rebounds and seven blocks. Gobert now has 25 blocks over his last five games. Up next, the Jazz continue their road swing in Houston on Saturday. Oklahoma City receives an extended break and will not play until Thursday, also in Houston.  ",Washington,Wizards,Chicago,Bulls,Capital One Arena,25,12,25,11,8.0,15.0,41.0,86.0,12.0,19.0,48.0,27.0,12.0,10.0,26.0,32.0,83.0,12.0,19.0,46.0,16.0,16.0,Paul Pierce,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,29,Jimmy Butler,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,36,Nene,11.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Pau Gasol,13.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Marcin Gortat,13.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,21.0,10.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,38,Joakim Noah,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Bradley Beal,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,38,Kirk Hinrich,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,20,John Wall,4.0,12.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,34,Derrick Rose,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,19.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,30,Kris Humphries,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Aaron Brooks,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,23,Rasual Butler,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,21,Taj Gibson,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Andre Miller,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,12,Tony Snell,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,18,Otto Porter Jr.,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Nikola Mirotic,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14,Kevin Seraphin,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,E'Twaun Moore,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13

												Danny Green scored 20 points and Patty Mills added 15 off the bench as the Spurs (22-15) took care of the Suns (22-17) 100-95 on Friday. San Antonio carried a six-point lead into the half, but the Suns came out firing in the third quarter, outscoring the Spurs 26-10 in the period. San Antonio would respond, however, starting the fourth on an 11-5 run keyed by three-pointers from Green and Mills. A Cory Joseph layup with 5:15 to play gave the Spurs their first lead of the fourth quarter, but Gerald Green would answer back on the ensuing Phoenix possession to give the Suns an 80-79 advantage. Joseph countered with two more baskets, putting the Spurs up for good with 3:55 remaining. The teams traded baskets down the stretch, but the San Antonio lead never shrunk to lower than three points. Green’s 20 led the way for San Antonio, and Tim Duncan (12 points) was the only other starter in double-figures. Tony Parker scored seven points in 22 minutes, and Joseph finished with 11 points in 24 minutes off the bench.

												The Warriors (29-5) handed the Cavaliers (19-18) their fourth straight loss Friday night, winning 112-94 at Oracle Arena. Golden State pulled away late, outscoring Cleveland by 10 in the fourth quarter capped by an 11-2 run to end the game. All five Warriors starters scored in double-figures, led by a combined 47 points from Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Curry added 10 assists while Thompson drilled four three-pointers. Marreese Speights added 12 points and eight rebounds, and Draymond Green nearly missed a triple-double, putting up 10 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, though he was 0-of-8 from beyond the arc. Andrew Bogut continued to come off the bench, playing 20 minutes and scoring four points to go with five rebounds and three assists. Cleveland, still without LeBron James (knee), got 23 points from Kyrie Irving and 17 from Kevin Love, but it wasn’t enough, as the Cavs shot only 41 percent from the floor as a team. New acquisition J.R. Smith got the start at shooting guard, as coach David Blatt shifted Matthew Dellavedova back to the bench. Smith played a team-high 42 minutes and finished with a game-high 27 points (11-23 FG). Up next, the Cavaliers head to Sacramento to face the Kings on Sunday night.

												The Charlotte Hornets (14-24) beat the Toronto Raptors (24-11) in Toronto on Thursday, 103-95. Toronto dropped just its fourth home game of the season and have now dropped four straight overall. The Hornets started the second half with a 14-1 run to gain an 11-point lead mid way through the third quarter. Charlotte had big contributions from Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker, who combined for 60 points in the contest.  Charlotte entered the game without Cody Zeller, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Marvin Williams filled in for Zeller and had a productive night, scoring 13 points (5-10 FG, 3-6 3Pt) to go along with nine rebounds. The Hornets combined to shoot 47.7% from the floor and outscored the Raptors in the paint despite missing Zeller. Kemba Walker just missed out on his fourth consecutive 30-point game, scoring 29 against the Raptors. Charlotte has now won four in a row and will take on the New York at Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Toronto has hit a rough patch and has now fallen to third place in the Eastern Conference behind the surging Hawks and Bulls. Kyle Lowry led the team in scoring with 24 points, but did so on just 7-of-22 shooting from the field. The Raptors will look to snap their losing streak on Saturday when they host the Celtics.

												The Houston Rockets (25-11) defeated the New York Knicks (5-34) by a score of 120-96 on Thursday at Madison Square Garden. Both teams were playing their second game in as many nights on Thursday and the Knicks kept the score competitive in the early going, but the Rockets proved to be too much for New York to handle. Houston shot 53% from the floor and 44% from three-point range. New York has now lost 13 games in a row and three straight by at least 20 points. The Knicks have now dropped 13 games in a row. Houston was able to build an insurmountable lead that allowed them to get several of their bench players some playing time. Five Rockets played at least ten minutes off the bench as Houston was able to win its second road game in a row. The Rockets will return home to host the Jazz on Saturday.New York trotted out a patchwork starting lineup with Amar'e Stoudemire, Andrea Bargnani, and Carmelo Anthony all sidelined with injuries. The lineup was comprised of Jason Smith, Cole Aldrich, Pablo Prigioni, Jose Calderon, and Tim Hardaway Jr. with several bench players seeing significant time as the game was a blow out by early in the third quarter.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (28-8) defeated the Miami Heat (15-21) on Thursday, 99-83.Portland's point guard, Damian Lillard, played in his 200th career game Thursday night and now officially has the most three-pointers of any player through his first 200 games with 502. Lillard was involved in a scary moment, however, when he and Dwayne Wade collided at the end of the first half. Both players returned to the game, fortunately. The Heat had a five-point lead at half, but that lead was short-lived as the Trail Blazers outscored Miami 56-35 in the second half. Miami dodged a bullet when Wade returned to action and finished the game having played 33 minutes. The Heat recalled Shabazz Napier earlier in the week from the D-League and he got some playing time towards the end of the game when the outcome was all but decided. Miami will continue its west coast road trip on Sunday against the Los Angeles Clippers. Portland has now won six of its last seven games and two in a row. Guard Wesley Matthews, who hyper-extended his knee Monday against the Lakers, scored 18 points in 30 minutes against the Heat. Portland will wrap up its seven-game home stand on Saturday against Orlando.

												The Charlotte Hornets (13-24) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (17-18) 98-94 on Wednesday.The Hornets pulled out a close one as Kemba Walker shouldered the scoring load with his third straight 30 point game. Walker also had the game-winning bucket with 1.8 seconds remaining, getting fouled on the shot and making his free throw to complete the three-point play. Gerald Henderson had a nice game, finishing with 16 points, seven rebounds, six assists and one block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist pitched in with 13 points and a team-leading 12 rebounds.  Charlotte has won three straight games without Al Jefferson (groin) and Lance Stephenson (pelvis).Anthony Davis had another monster game, finishing with 32 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks in 42 minutes. It was not enough to fend off a second half comeback by the Charlotte Hornets who were down by seven points at halftime. Down three with 1.8 seconds remaining, Tyreke Evans had his pass stolen by Marvin Williams to end any hope of salvaging a road victory for the Pelicans who are now 6-13 on the road this season.The Charlotte Hornets will travel to Toronto to play the Raptors on Thursday, and the Pelicans will head back home to face the Memphis Grizzles on Friday											",Charlotte,Hornets,New Orleans,Pelicans,Spectrum Center,17,18,13,24,4.0,14.0,37.0,86.0,20.0,26.0,43.0,18.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,12.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Tyreke Evans,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,35,Cody Zeller,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Anthony Davis,12.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,32.0,15.0,24.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,41,Bismack Biyombo,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Omer Asik,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Gerald Henderson,7.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,35,Eric Gordon,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,38,Kemba Walker,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,31.0,12.0,24.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,36,Jrue Holiday,6.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,38,Marvin Williams,1.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,25,Ryan Anderson,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,29,Gary Neal,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,17,Dante Cunningham,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,PJ Hairston,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7,Jimmer Fredette,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,10,Jason Maxiell,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Alexis Ajinca,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Brian Roberts,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,11,Luke Babbitt,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Houston Rockets (24-11) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (19-17) 105-93 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.After ending the third quarter down 74-73, the Rockets came out and had a strong fourth quarter, out-scoring the Cavaliers by an impresive 32-19 mark, allowing them to steal the victory on the road in Cleveland. The Rockets were able to out-rebound the Cavaliers 50-37, only furthering their advantage in this one. Like he's done so many times already this season, James Harden led the Rockets to this victory. He came close to a triple-double, finishing with 21 points (6-18 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 7-7 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. He did turn the ball over seven times though, so he'll need to cut those down in the near future. As expected, Dwight Howard was able to use his size advantage over Tristan Thompson and the Cavaliers' bigs. He went off for 17 points (6-13 FG, 5-11 FT) and 19 rebounds, marking his third double-double in a row. He's averaged 17.3 points and 15.3 rebounds over that stretch of three games. Trevor Ariza was able to do it on both sides of the ball, recording 13 points (5-13 FG, 3-10 3Pt), six rebounds and five steals. He's had a tremendous amount of steals over his last three games, combining for 14 over that period. The Rockets did have solid contributions off their bench as well with Josh Smith scoring 16 points (7-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and Corey Brewer adding 12 points (4-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT). The Cavaliers got most of their production out of their two superstars, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Irving had the biggest contribution, going 15-for-26 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 38 points. The points were a season-high for him as well, as he's continued to get off the bulk of the shots with LeBron James still sitting out. Love on the other hand notched another double-double, finishing with 17 points (7-19 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and 16 rebounds. It marked his third double-double in a row, where he's averaged 25.0 points and 15.0 rebounds between those games. The only other Cavalier to reach double-digit points was Tristan Thompson, who added 11 points (2-7 FG, 7-7 FT) and six rebounds of his own. The Cavaliers' bench combined for only 13 points.The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Thursday, while the Cavaliers will travel to Oakland to play the Golden State Warriors on Friday. 											",Cleveland,Cavaliers,Houston,Rockets,Quicken Loans Arena,24,11,19,17,10.0,29.0,34.0,82.0,15.0,19.0,37.0,16.0,15.0,12.0,34.0,39.0,86.0,15.0,24.0,50.0,26.0,17.0,Mike Miller,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,27,Trevor Ariza,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,35,Kevin Love,16.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,19.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,38,Donatas Motiejunas,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,27,Tristan Thompson,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Dwight Howard,19.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,37,Matthew Dellavedova,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,34,James Harden,7.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,18.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,33,Kyrie Irving,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,38.0,15.0,26.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,41,Patrick Beverley,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,30,Brendan Haywood,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5,Josh Smith,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,25,JR Smith,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,17,Corey Brewer,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,20,Shawn Marion,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Jason Terry,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,24,Joe Harris,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,15,Kostas Papanikolaou,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6,James Jones,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,10,Isaiah Canaan,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

												The Milwaukee Bucks (19-18) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (5-29) 97-77 on Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.The Bucks out-shot the Sixers by a large margin in this one, going 54 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Sixers went just 30 percent from the floor and a meager eight percent from beyond the arc. It was a sloppy game all-around though, as both teams turned the ball over more than 23 times. Despite shooting 18 less free throws, the Bucks still secured the 20-point victory.The Bucks' backcourt of Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton did the bulk of the damage in this one. Knight went 6-for-12 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also adding five assists. He's had the hot hand lately and is averaging 21.4 points per game over his last five outings. Middleton on the other hand had a very efficient 18 points (7-9 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own, but did it on the defensive side of the ball as well with five steals. The five steals were a season-high for Middleton. The Bucks did have a strong showing from their bench as well. O.J. Mayo recorded 15 points (6-11 FG,  2-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and six assists, while Jarryd Bayless went a perfect 6-for-6 from the floor to score 12 points of his own. Bayless did a little bit of everything in this game, as he also chipped in five rebounds, four assists and two steals. The Sixers had a brutal showing offensively, marked by a combined 2-for-25 from the three-point line as a team. They were led in scoring by rookie guard K.J. McDaniels, who went 5-for-8 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free throw line to score 14 points, while also adding six rebounds. He's now put together a couple of solid games in a row, with 26 points over those two games. The only other starter to reach double figures in points was Nerlens Noel. Noel had 13 points (6-10 FG, 1-2 FT), five rebounds and two blocks in 28 minutes. He's now had two blocks in three out of his last four games, continuing to make an impact on the defensive side of the ball. Michael Carter-Williams, who normally is the leader of this team, really struggled with his shot, going 1-for-13 from the field and 0-for-4 from the three-point line to finish with five points.  The Bucks' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday, while the Sixers will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Friday.

												The Washington Wizards (24-11) scored more points than the New York Knicks (5-33), 101-91. The Knicks recorded their franchise-record and league-leading 13th straight loss to maintain a stranglehold on last place in the Eastern Conference.The Knicks were without the services of Carmelo Anthony, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Andrea Bargnani due to injury. They used their 21st unique starting lineup. At one point during the contest, the Knicks' lineup contained four players from their summer league roster. Jose Calderon kept his free-throw streak alive, converting his lone attempt for a perfect 21-of-21 mark. Langston Galloway made his season debut on the strength of a 10-day contract and contributed seven points (2-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), three assists, two rebounds and one steal in 17 minutes. Paul Pierce rested his second game all season, and Otto Porter started in his absence. Nene Hilario picked up his second technical foul of the season and led the team with 20 points (8-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT), six rebounds, four assists and one steal in 24 minutes.

												The Boston Celtics (12-21) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (16-19) 89-81 on Wednesday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.The Nets continue to struggle, with this loss marking their third in a row. Despite out-rebounding the Celtics 50-41, they were forced into 18 turnovers compared to only seven from the Celtics, which very well may have been the difference in this ball game.While they may have secured the victory, the Celtics still only had two players reach double figures in points. Avery Bradley led the way, going 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 21 points. Bradley struggled to only four points against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Tyler Zeller was the other Celtic to reach double-digits in points. He finished with 18 points (7-14 FG, 4-4 FT), six rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes. The four assists matched a season-high for him, while he's now averaging 9.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game this season. Evan Turner didn't have his best game offensively with only six points, but he did get it done everywhere else, adding eight rebounds, seven assists and two steals to his totals. The Nets saw a good showing from starting center Mason Plumlee, who finished with 16 points (5-11 FG, 6-11 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. It marked his seventh double-double of the year, pushing his season averages to 9.6 points and 6.7 rebounds on the year. Joe Johnson also played well, scoring 17 points (7-16 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) while adding three assists. He continues to be one of the most consistent scorers for this team. With Deron Williams playing only four minutes off the bench due to injury, Jarrett Jack got the start at point guard. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 15 points. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 35 points and 14 assists over those two games. Kevin Garnett finished with 10 points and eight rebounds.   The Celtics' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Friday, while the Nets will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.  											",Brooklyn,Nets,Boston,Celtics,Barclays Center,12,21,16,19,3.0,14.0,29.0,72.0,18.0,26.0,50.0,17.0,17.0,5.0,18.0,35.0,88.0,14.0,17.0,41.0,22.0,6.0,Joe Johnson,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,16.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,36,Jeff Green,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,32,Kevin Garnett,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Jared Sullinger,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Mason Plumlee,12.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,36,Tyler Zeller,6.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Sergey Karasev,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,22,Avery Bradley,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,34,Jarrett Jack,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,39,Evan Turner,8.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,26,Mirza Teletovic,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,19,Kelly Olynyk,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Alan Anderson,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24,Marcus Smart,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,21,Brook Lopez,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Brandon Bass,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Deron Williams,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4,Jae Crowder,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Bojan Bogdanovic,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,11,Marcus Thornton,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13

												The Detroit Pistons (12-23) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (26-11) 108-95 on Wednesday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. With a 74-68 lead at the end of the third quarter, the Pistons remained in control. They went on to out-score the Mavericks 34-27 in the fourth quarter, allowing them to end the Mavericks six-game winning streak and push their own to seven in a row. The Pistons were able to out-rebound the Mavericks 60-43, giving them an even greater advantage in the victory. Greg Monroe continued his stretch of impressive games. He went 11-for-16 from the field and 5-for-5 from the free throw line to score 27 points, while also chipping in with 18 rebounds and six assists. The double-double marked his fourth in a row, as he's averaging 17.5 points and 12.5 rebounds over that stretch of games. In another surprise performance off the bench, D.J. Augustin went 9-for-16 from the floor and 4-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 26 points. After scoring 19 points against the Spurs on Tuesday, he continued to sport the hot hand in the Pistons' second unit. Andre Drummond didn't have a big night offensively, but was again a hound on the boards with 19 rebounds in 30 minutes. He's now had at least 10 rebounds in 13 out of his last 14 games. Brandon Jennings reached double figures as well with 14 points (7-18 FG, 0-2 3Pt), while adding four rebounds and six assists. The Mavericks saw a big game from Dirk Nowitzki, who finished with 19 points (8-19 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and five rebounds. It was right on par with his season average of 18.4 points per game. Monta Ellis had 16 points (6-17 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT) of his own, along with five rebounds and four assists. It wasn't his best shooting outing of the year, but he still was able to put some points on the board. In a nice performance off the bench, Devin Harris went 5-for-8 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 14 points in 21 minutes. It was his best offensive showing since back in early December, so he'll hope to keep that momentum going. The only other Maverick to reach double figures in points was Chandler Parsons, who finished with 15 points (5-13 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT) in 35 minutes.  The Pistons' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Mavericks will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Saturday. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Detroit,Pistons,American Airlines Center,12,23,26,11,5.0,21.0,37.0,86.0,13.0,18.0,43.0,23.0,14.0,10.0,21.0,43.0,97.0,12.0,14.0,60.0,22.0,15.0,Chandler Parsons,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,13.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,35,Kyle Singler,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,20,Dirk Nowitzki,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,19.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,28,Greg Monroe,18.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,27.0,11.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,34,Tyson Chandler,15.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,31,Andre Drummond,19.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Monta Ellis,5.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,17.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,35,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,17,Rajon Rondo,6.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,28,Brandon Jennings,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,26,Devin Harris,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,21,Caron Butler,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,27,Charlie Villanueva,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,14,Jonas Jerebko,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Greg Smith,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Jodie Meeks,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,30,Richard Jefferson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,17,D.J.

												The Denver Nuggets (16-20) defeated the Orlando Magic (13-25) 93-90 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. The Nuggets were the better shooting team in this one, going 45 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line, while the Magic went 40 percent from the floor and 36 percent from beyond the arc. Along with the shooting advantage, the Nuggets also out-rebounded the Magic 47-42, helping them edge the Magic with a three point victory. As has been the case for the majority of the season, the Nuggets relied on their starting backcourt for their offensive production. Ty Lawson led the team with 23 points, as he was able to shoot 9-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line. After recording only eight points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, this performance was a nice bounce back game for him. Arron Afflalo had a solid contribution of his own, scoring 17 points (7-13 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-6 FT), while adding six rebounds and three assists. He's had the hot hand of late, as he's averaging 23.3 points over his last four games. The Nuggets also saw their bench chip in as Nate Robinson recorded 13 points (1-6 FG, 1-1 3Pt). While he really struggled with his shot from the field, he forced his way to the line all game, converting on a perfect 10-of-10 from the free throw line. J.J. Hickson recorded a double-double off the bench with 11 points (4-5 FG, 3-4 FT) and 10 rebounds as well.The Magic took advantage of Nuggets' starting center Jusuf Nurkic, who is in his rookie season and was forced into the starting lineup after Timofey Mozgov was traded to the Cavaliers. They fed the ball to Nikola Vucevic all night, who finished with 20 points (8-18 FG, 4-6 FT) and 11 rebounds in 34 minutes. It was his second 20-point performance in a row, along with his second double-double in as many games. Victor Oladipo had a strong night offensively. He went 7-for-13 from the field and 3-for-4 from the free throw line to score 17 points, while also recording six assists. He also added three steals, after posting four on Sunday against the Charlotte Hornets. Coming off the bench, Evan Fournier stayed productive. He went 4-for-8 from the field and 2-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 14 points in 18 minutes. Tobias Harris didn't have the offensive numbers he's come accustomed to this year, as he finished with only 12 points (5-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 0-1 FT) and six rebounds.     The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Friday, while the Magic will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday. 											",Denver,Nuggets,Orlando,Magic,Pepsi Center,13,25,16,20,,,,,,,,,,5.0,18.0,31.0,78.0,12.0,16.0,38.0,20.0,14.0,Wilson Chandler,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,33,Tobias Harris,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,32,Kenneth Faried,12.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Kyle O'Quinn,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,15,Jusuf Nurkic,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Nikola Vucevic,11.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Arron Afflalo,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,43,Victor Oladipo,1.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,35,Ty Lawson,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,34,Elfrid Payton,8.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,JJ Hickson,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,29,Channing Frye,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,19,Nate Robinson,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,26,Evan Fournier,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,18,Darrell Arthur,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,17,Dewayne Dedmon,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Alonzo Gee,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,Ben Gordon,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,13,Erick Green,,,,,,,,,,,,Luke Ridnour,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,14

												The Phoenix Suns (22-16) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-29) 113-111 on Wednesday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.After finishing the third quarter down 78-71, the Suns were able to have a huge fourth quarter, out-scoring the Wolves 42-33 to steal the victory on the road. Despite being out-rebounded 46-41, the Suns were able to force the Timberwolves into 22 turnovers, which may have been the difference in this one. The Suns had another strong showing from their backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. Dragic led the team with 25 points (11-16 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT), while he also added three rebounds and four assists. He continues to have the slight lead over Bledsoe as the the team scoring leader at 16.7 points per game. Bledsoe had 17 points (7-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT) of his own. He did a little bit of everything tonight, as he contributed five rebounds, seven assists and five steals as well. The five steals were a season-high for him, as he was a big reason for the large turnover differential. The Suns got a lot of production from their bench, with both Isaiah Thomas and Gerald Green reaching double figures in points. Thomas had 17 points (6-14 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and a season-high of five steals, while Green recorded 21 points (8-16 FG, 3-8  3pt, 2-2 FT) and three rebounds. The Timberwolves were led by rookie Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins went 10-for-16 from the floor and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score 25 points, while also adding four rebounds and three steals. He's had the hot hand lately, as he averaged 22.6 points over his last five games. Mo Williams had a strong showing of his own, scoring 23 points (7-14 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and handing out 11 assists. It was his sixth double-double of the season. Thaddeus Young didn't have his best shooting performance, but posted 13 points (6-18 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and eight rebounds. The Timberwolves had a solid bench presence, as Anthony Bennett and Chase Budinger reached double figures in points. Bennet recorded his second double-double of the season with 14 points (6-10 FG, 2-2 FT) and 10 rebounds, while Budinger had 10 points (5-7 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and five rebounds. The Suns' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Friday. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Phoenix,Suns,Target Center,22,16,5,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shabazz Muhammad,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,32,P.J.

												The Sacramento Kings (15-20) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (17-19) 104-83 on Wednesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. The Kings came out hot right from the start, out-scoring the Thunder 28-16 in the first quarter. They had superior shooting all night, going 39 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three-point line as a team, compared to the Thunder who went 33 percent from the floor and only 30 percent from beyond the arc. Sacramento was also able to force the Thunder into 24 turnovers, while giving it up only 16 times themselves. Rudy Gay led all scorers in this one. He went 9-for-19 from the field and a perfect 3-for-3 from the three-point line to finish with 28 points. He nearly notched a double-double as he added nine rebounds as well. He had a poor shooting performance on Sunday against the Detroit Pistons, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. DeMarcus Cousins also reached the 20-point mark, as he double-doubled with 23 points (6-23 FG) and 15 rebounds. He was able to get to the free throw line 13 times, and converted on 11-of-13. It was his second double-double in a row and fifth in his last six games. Starting at point guard, Darren Collison went 9-for-19 from the field and 5-for-10 from beyond the arc to score 24 points, while adding seven assists to go along with it. It was the most three-point shots he's attempted all season, but he was still very effective. Ben McLemore and Carl Landry had 11 and 10 points respectively. Kevin Durant led the Thunder with 24 points (8-20 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 5-7 FG) and nine rebounds. He had a brutal showing from the floor on Monday when he went 3-for-16 from the field, so it was good to see him turn things around. Serge Ibaka nearly recorded a triple-double, with 11 points (5-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt), 10 rebounds and eight blocked shots. The eight blocked shots were a season-high for him, but it didn't help the Thunder enough, as their offense was too poor in this one to overcome their large deficit. Reggie Jackson was one of the other few bright spots. He went 6-for-11 from the floor and 2-for-4 from beyond the arc to add 14 points off the bench. He only played 22 minutes, otherwise his numbers would have been much higher. In his Thunder debut, Dion Waiters got 22 minutes of game action, but struggled with his shot and went just 1-for-9 from the field and 0-for-3 from deep to score four points. The Kings' next game will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Friday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Friday. 											",Sacramento,Kings,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Golden 1 Center,17,19,15,20,10.0,19.0,36.0,92.0,22.0,28.0,52.0,18.0,16.0,8.0,26.0,27.0,79.0,14.0,21.0,51.0,15.0,23.0,Rudy Gay,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,9.0,19.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,35,Kevin Durant,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,8.0,20.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,32,Jason Thompson,8.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Serge Ibaka,10.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,32,DeMarcus Cousins,15.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,23.0,6.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,37,Steven Adams,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Ben McLemore,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,34,Andre Roberson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Darren Collison,1.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,19.0,5.0,10.0,3.0,38,Russell Westbrook,7.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,19.0,0.0,5.0,7.0,27,Carl Landry,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Kendrick Perkins,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Derrick Williams,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,26,Anthony Morrow,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,26,Nik Stauskas,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Nick Collison,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,17,Ryan Hollins,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Perry Jones III,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Ray McCallum,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Reggie Jackson,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,21

												The Golden State Warriors (28-5) defeated the Indiana Pacers (14-23) 117-102 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.Despite a close first half, the Warriors got hot in the second half, out-scoring the Pacers 67-52 to close out the game at home in front of their home crowd. They were the superior shooters, going an impressive 50 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line, while the Pacers went 46 percent from the floor and just 23 percent from beyond the arc. The Warriors were able to force the Pacers into 17 turnovers. Klay Thompson was unstoppable in this one. He went 14-for-25 from the field and 6-for-11 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 40 points. It was his second 40-point game of the year, after torching the Lakers for 41 points back in early November. Stephen Curry had a strong showing of his own, scoring 21 points (8-17 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 1-1 FT) while adding 15 assists and four steals. The assists matched a season-high for him, while the double-double was his second in the last three games. It was also his second game in a row with four steals, as he keeps getting it done on the defensive side of the ball as well. Filling in as the starting center, Marreese Speights went 8-for-12 from the floor to score 18 points. Even with a six point outing on Monday, Speights is averaging 18.3 points over his last four games as he continues to roll with a hot hand. David Lee had 13 points (6-10 FG, 1-2 FT) off the bench. With Roy Hibbert going down with an ankle injury after only five minutes, the Pacers were even further out-matched. Solomon Hill did everything he could to keep them in the game, going 8-for-15 from the three-point line and 2-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 21 points. It was his best offensive showing since back in mid-November, so it was good to see him having success. David West did a little bit of everything in this game, as he finished with 16 points (6-11 FG, 4-4 FT), seven rebounds and six assists. The assists matched a season-high for West. Coming off the bench both Donald Sloan (6-11 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and Luis Scola (5-12 FG, 4-4 FT) pitched in 14 points of their own. The Pacers just didn't have the scoring power to keep up with an excellent Warriors squad.The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, while the Pacers will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Indiana,Pacers,Chase Center,14,23,28,5,12.0,28.0,45.0,91.0,15.0,20.0,39.0,30.0,11.0,6.0,26.0,37.0,81.0,22.0,23.0,41.0,24.0,17.0,Harrison Barnes,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Solomon Hill,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,34,Draymond Green,9.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,29,David West,7.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,34,Marreese Speights,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Roy Hibbert,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,Klay Thompson,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,40.0,14.0,25.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,40,CJ Miles,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,15.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,34,Stephen Curry,3.0,15.0,4.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,17.0,4.0,8.0,5.0,34,C.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (24-12) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (11-25) 114-89 on Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Clippers had a monster first half where they out-scored the Lakers 70-48, allowing them to coast to an easy victory against the Lakers. They were the superior shooters in this one, going 47 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers went 44 percent from the floor and only 25 percent from beyond the arc. The Clippers had all five starters reach double figures in points. Blake Griffin led all scorers, as he nearly triple-doubled with 27 points (9-13 FG, 9-13 FT), nine rebounds and eight assists. He's had an impressive two-game stretch where he's averaged 26.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and seven assists. Chris Paul added an impressive night with his shot as well. He went 9-for-15 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 24 points, while adding 11 assists. It marked his third triple-double in a row, as he continues to find teammates at a very high rate. Matt Barnes finished with 19 points (6-12 FG, 5-10 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own. He got off a season-high in number of three-pointers, and cashed in on the extra attempts. Both DeAndre Jordan and J.J. Redick finished in double figures, as Jordan had 10 points (4-7 FG, 2-4 FT) and 13 rebounds, while Redick had 10 points (3-8 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and two assists.Kobe Bryant really struggled in this game. He shot very poorly, going only 2-for-12 from the field and 0-for-3 from the three-point line to score four points. He did pitch in with eight rebounds and seven assists, but the six turnovers he had took away from his assists. With Bryant having an off night, it spelled doom for the Lakers from the start. Their biggest contribution came from Jordan Clarkson, who came off the bench to score 14 points (6-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and grab four rebounds. It was a season-high in points for him and a nice surprise as he's averaging only 4.9 points per game on the year. Like Bryant, Nick Young didn't have his best game from the floor. Young went only 4-of-15 from the field and 1-of-6 from deep to post 11 points. With two of the leading scorers for this team having off days, the Lakers just couldn't keep up.  The Clippers' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Orlando Magic on Friday. 											",Los Angeles,Clippers,Los Angeles,Lakers,Staples Center,11,25,24,12,12.0,32.0,39.0,80.0,22.0,30.0,42.0,28.0,6.0,5.0,20.0,35.0,81.0,9.0,14.0,43.0,21.0,12.0,Matt Barnes,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,6.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,30,Kobe Bryant,8.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,27,Blake Griffin,9.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,27.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Ed Davis,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,DeAndre Jordan,13.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Jordan Hill,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,JJ Redick,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,26,Wayne Ellington,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,39,Chris Paul,2.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,15.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,31,Jeremy Lin,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,26,Jamal Crawford,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,17,Carlos Boozer,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Spencer Hawes,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,13,Robert Sacre,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Jordan Farmar,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16,Jordan Clarkson,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,20,Reggie Bullock,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15,Nick Young,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,15.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,30,Glen Davis,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Ryan Kelly,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12

												The Phoenix Suns (21-16) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (18-18) 102-96 Tuesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. The tide seemed to be turning in Milwaukee's favor in the third quarter when the Bucks' Brandon Knight threw down an emphatic dunk to tie it at 56. The Suns' defense clamped down in the fourth quarter, however, allowing just 24 points in the period with four of those points coming when the game was out of reach. Phoenix's Markieff Morris drained a deep three to all-but seal the game with under a minute in the fourth. Phoenix got a big game from Markieff Morris, who posted a double-double with 26 points and 10 rebounds. Isaiah Thomas made a big contribution, coming off the bench with 19 points in 31 minutes on the floor. The Suns will travel to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Wednesday. The Bucks dropped their fourth consecutive game at home Tuesday. They shot a paltry 3-of-20 from three-point range against the Suns and now have a quick turnaround as they travel to Philadelphia to take on the 76ers on Wednesday.

												The Detroit Pistons (11-23) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (21-15) 105-104 on Tuesday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.Quite unexpectedly, the Pistons were able to keep their winning streak alive and extended it to six games in a row Tuesday. After the Pistons came out of the third quarter leading 82-77, the Spurs went on a fourth quarter run, out-scoring the Pistons 27-23. It wasn't enough though, as the Spurs turned the ball over late when Tony Parker couldn't handle an inbound pass from Tim Duncan and in turn Brandon Jennings took advantage, hitting a running bank shot with under a second left in the game to steal the victory.The Pistons had contributions from all over the court with six players reaching double figures in points. Andre Drummond led the charge, finishing with a monster line of 20 points (8-10 FG, 4-9 FT) and 17 rebounds. It was his second double-double in a row, as he's combined for 35 points and 31 rebounds over his last two outings. Greg Monroe notched a double-double of his own, going for 17 points (7-10 FG, 3-4 FT) and 11 rebounds. The Pistons' big men had their way in this game, as both were extremely efficient all night long. Along with the game-winning shot, Jennings had 13 points (5-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and seven assists. While it wasn't his best night shooting, he came in clutch when it mattered, so you can't argue with his performance. Coming off the bench, D.J. Augustin had a strong game. He went off for 19 points (8-18 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and five assists, coming one point short of matching a season-high.For the Spurs, Tim Duncan did everything he could to combat the big night of the Pistons big men. Duncan went 7-for-12 from the field to score 15 points, while also adding seven rebounds and two blocks. He struggled to only four points in Saturday's game against the Wizards, so it was a nice bounce back outing for him. Having a big night off the bench was Jeff Ayres. Ayres went 5-for-8 from the field and 6-for-7 from the free throw line to score 16 points in only 16 minutes. It was far and away a season-high for him, after reaching double-digits in points only one other time this season. Tony Parker was able to get the start after missing the last five games with a hamstring injury. He ended up only playing 12 minutes though, and finished with three points and a pair of assists. Both Danny Green (5-10 FG, 3-5 3Pt) and Marco Belinelli (4-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-2FT) had strong shooting efforts in this one, finishing with 13 and 12 points respectively.The Pistons' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Spurs will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Friday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (5-28) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (19-16) 95-92 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.After a strong first half where the Cavaliers out-scored the Sixers 50-37, the Sixers made a strong push in the second half and fought their way back to take a 93-92 lead with just under 10 seconds left in regulation after Tony Wroten converted on a layup. The Cavaliers then had a chance to take the lead with three seconds left on the clock, but Matthew Delavedova was unable to convert on a layup of his own and the Sixers then clinched with a pair of free throws to seal the deal. Philadelphia shot a superior 48 percent from the field, while Cleveland went just 39 percent from the floor.Along with making the go-ahead layup, Wroten also scored a team-high of 20 points (8-18 FG, 0-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT), while adding eight assists. He's now averaging 25.0 points per game over his last three outings, as he's continued to be a consistent scoring threat off the bench for the Sixers. Michael Carter-Williams had a solid contribution of his own. He recorded his seventh double-double of the season, finishing with 18 points (8-19 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and 13 assists. He was very successful against a young Cavaliers backcourt without the likes of Kyrie Irving. Robert Covington got the start at small forward in this one. He took advantage of the start and posted 16 points (4-9 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and six rebounds in 39 minutes. He's had a solid couple of games in a row, combining for 39 points over his last two outings. Both K.J. McDaniels and Henry Sims had 12 points apiece.The Cavaliers were without superstars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, but were still expected to come into Philadelphia and secure the victory. Despite the loss though, Kevin Love was one of the few bright spots. He had a monster double-double, recording 28 points (8-18 FG, 1-6 3Pt) and 19 rebounds. He also got to the free throw line 13 times, converting on 11 of those attempts. He's now averaging 28.3 points and 11.3 rebounds over his last three outings, as he's had to take it on himself to increase production with a few key members of the starting lineup sidelined. Tristan Thompson nearly had a double-double of his own and finished with 18 points (8-17 FG, 2-5 FT) and nine rebounds. The only other Cavalier to reach double-digits in scoring was Joe Harris. Harris was in the starting lineup, going 6-for-12 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score 16 points in 31 minutes.The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. 											",Philadelphia,76ers,Cleveland,Cavaliers,Wells Fargo Center,19,16,5,28,7.0,23.0,38.0,79.0,12.0,15.0,43.0,31.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,Robert Covington,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,39,Mike Miller,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,24,Henry Sims,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,23,Kevin Love,19.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,28.0,8.0,18.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,37,Nerlens Noel,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Tristan Thompson,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,40,KJ McDaniels,3.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,31,Joe Harris,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,31,Michael Carter-Williams,6.0,13.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,19.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,41,Matthew Dellavedova,2.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,39,Malcolm Thomas,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Shawn Marion,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21,Tony Wroten,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,6.0,5.0,27,James Jones,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,27,Furkan Aldemir,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,AJ Price,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,13,Jerami Grant,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Brendan Haywood,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,JaKarr Sampson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Lou Amundson,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Charlotte Hornets (12-24) defeated the Boston Celtics (11-21) 104-95 on Monday at the TD Garden in Boston.Behind a strong first half where the Hornets out-scored the Celtics 50-36, Charlotte was then able to coast to the victory in the second half as they shot a superior 49 percent from the field, while Boston shot just 40 percent from the floor. The Hornets were also able to out-rebound the Celtics by a wide margin of 48-33, despite turning the ball over 16 times.The Hornets were led by starting point guard Kemba Walker. Walker went 12-for-26 from the floor and 2-for-7 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 33 points, while also adding five assists. It was his second 30-point outing in a row for the team, as he's now combined for 63 points over his last two games. The Hornets also received a solid contribution from Cody Zeller who went a perfect 8-for-8 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free throw line to finish with 20 points and seven rebounds. It was a season-high in points for Zeller and a surprising performance, as he's averaging just 7.7 points per game thus far in the season. Gerald Henderson came just shy of a double-double, recording 13 points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and eight assists. The only other Hornet to reach double-digit points was Marvin Williams, who came off the bench for 10 points of his own.Jared Sullinger was the only member of the Celtics starting rotation to really get something going in this game. He went 8-for-16 from the field and 6-for-6 from the free throw line to score 22 points, while also chipping in eight rebounds. It was one point shy of a season-high for him, as he's now put together a very strong string of games over the last two weeks. The majority of the rest of the Celtics production came from the bench. Jae Crowder played 25 minutes and was able to record 13 points (5-10 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT), while James Young recorded an efficient 13 points (5-7 FG, 3-4 3Pt) of his own, playing in only 17 minutes. Rookie Marcus Smart had nine points and four assists off the bench in 20 minutes as well.  The Hornets' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Celtics will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Wednesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (26-10) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (16-17) 96-88 in overtime on Monday. Dallas has won six straight games. Monta Ellis led the way for the Mavericks, finishing with a team-high 19 points in 38 minutes. Rajon Rondo posted a double-double with two points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists. Dallas struggled shooting the ball Monday, hitting just 39 percent of their shots from the field, but they also held the Nets to 39 percent shooting to keep the game competitive until they could close it out in the extra period. The Mavericks will return home to host the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday. Brooklyn has lost two straight, hitting a slight road bump after securing three consecutive wins before the lull. Deron Williams (oblique) and Kevin Garnett (rest) sat out the game. With Garnett out, Brook Lopez earned another spot start in the frontcourt next to Mason Plumlee. Lopez finished with a game-high 22 points and 13 rebounds in 33 minutes. Jarrett Jack also put up a double-double, finishing with 20 points and 10 assists in 43 minutes. The Nets have taken a bold stance by putting out some of their lesser-known players in the starting lineup over Williams and Lopez, but the gamble has largely paid off, as they've won six of their last nine games. Brooklyn will stay home to host the Boston Celtics on Wednesday.

												The Chicago Bulls (25-10) fended off the Houston Rockets (23-11), 114-105, at the United Center on Monday evening.Entering the fourth quarter with a six-point deficit facing them, the Bulls whittled away at the Rockets' lead and finally knotted up the score at 100 with just under three minutes remaining. Thereafter, Chicago received scoring contributions from six different players, but their push in the final period was ultimately powered by rookie Nikola Mirotic and Jimmy Butler, who spearheaded a 31-point explosion with a combined 17 points, nine rebounds, and three three-pointers. In the end, a Bulls squad without Mike Dunleavy (ankle) achieved its third victory in a row, and 10th in 11 contests, on the backs of a complete team effort led by Pau Gasol's 27 points and 14 rebounds. Meanwhile, Derrick Rose toughed out a right hip contusion en route to 19 points and nine assists in 34 minutes. By the final horn, the Bulls had accumulated a whopping 12 blocks, 10 steals, and 30 free-throw attempts, of which they knocked down 27.On the other side, the Rockets fell to 3-4 with newcomer Josh Smith, despite his team-high 21 points on 10-of-20 from the field. While Dwight Howard posted a customary, but underwhelming double-double (12 points and 14 boards), James Harden was perhaps the primary reason for Houston's downfall, missing all three field goal attempts and committing three fouls, including a charge for one of his two turnovers in the fourth quarter. Harden still managed a stat-laden line, recording 20 points, three assists, two rebounds, two blocks, and one steal in 38 minutes, and backcourt mate Patrick Beverley aided the Rockets' effort further with 14 points, six assists, and six rebounds. However, knocking down only 8-for-25 from three-point range didn't do them any favors in the loss.Houston will continue their three-game road swing Wednesday in Cleveland, while the Bulls remain home for Wednesday's outing against the Jazz.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (25-9) defeated the New York Knicks (5-32) 105-83 on Monday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.The Grizzlies were able to dominate right from the start in this one, out-scoring the Knicks 47-36 in the first half alone. They were then able to coast to a 22-point victory in the second half, giving the home fans a show. The Grizzlies were the superior shooters in this one, going 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, while the Knicks went just 43 percent from the floor and 31 percent from beyond the arc.With Zach Randolph still sidelined, both Mike Conley and Marc Gasol continued to make up for the bulk of his production. Conley had a very effective shooting night, going 9-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 22 points. He did a little bit of everything in this game, nearing a triple-double with seven rebounds and seven assists as well. Conley struggled to only eight points on Saturday, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Gasol on the other hand posted 14 points (5-12 FG, 4-5 FT), eight rebounds and two blocks. He didn't near his season average of 20.0 points per game, but he was still effective enough to help secure the victory. Tony Allen had 14 points (6-8 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-1 FT) of his own. More importantly though, Allen had a huge defensive effort in this one, posting a season-high of seven steals. The only other player to reach double figures was Courtney Lee, who had 11 points in 26 minutes.The Knicks were still without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire, which continued to limit their offensive abilities. Quincy Acy led the team in a surprise performance off the bench. He went 7-for-8 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 19 points. He had only reached double figures three other times this season, making it even more impressive for the young forward. He also got it done on the boards though, posting a season-high of 14 rebounds. It marked his first double-double of the year. Jose Calderon was one of the only other players to give Acy any help. Calderon was very efficient with his shot, going 5-for-7 from the floor and 3-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 13 points, while adding six assists.

												The Washington Wizards (23-11) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (17-17) 92-85 on Monday.Washington stopped the bleeding from their three-game losing streak with the win and ended their five-game West Conference road trip on a high note. John Wall paced the Wizards with a double-double of 15 points and 12 assists. While they shot a respectable 48 percent from the field, the Wizards allowed the Pelicans to stay in the game by giving up 19 easy points off of 12 turnovers. Washington will return home to host the New York Knicks on Wednesday.New Orleans has been trading wins for loses from game to game, going 6-5 over their last 11 games. After missing the last 21 games rehabbing a shoulder injury, Eric Gordon was cleared to return to action and was immediately placed back into the starting lineup at shooting guard. Tyreke Evans was questionable to play with an illness, but he fought through and began the game playing off the bench before moving back into the starting lineup at halftime. Gordon finished with six points, four rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes, continuing to play the passive game he adopted coming into the season. Evans tied Anthony Davis for the team-high in points with 21 and also collected seven rebounds and four assists. New Orleans will go on the road Wednesday to play the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Indiana Pacers (14-22) defeated the Utah Jazz (12-23) 105-101 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.After ending the third quarter down 74-62, the Jazz looked to have only an outside shot of securing a victory, but they were able to have a huge fourth quarter, narrowing the gap to just one point in the final minute of the game. The comeback came up just short though, as the Pacers were able to hit their free throws in the end and seal the win on the road. Indiana shot much better in this game, going 47 percent from the field and 54 percent from the three-point line, while the Jazz shot 43 percent from the floor and only 17 percent from deep.The Pacers got their biggest contribution from Roy Hibbert, who finished with 22 points (8-13 FG, 6-6 FT) and eight rebounds. He was able to use his veteran experience against the younger frontcourt of the Jazz, increasing his production from what it's been throughout the season thus far. Rodney Stuckey also had a solid game. He scored 13 points (4-7 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and had two steals in 20 minutes. Where the Pacers had the biggest advantage though was in their bench production. Luis Scola had a very efficient game off the bench, going 7-for-9 from the field and 2-for-2 from the free throw line to score 16 points. He's only scored 16 points or more one other time this season, so it was somewhat of a surprise performance for him. Also coming off the bench, C.J. Miles recorded 13 points (4-12 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and six rebounds. He continues to be very productive, as he averaged 22.0 points in the three games prior to this outing.The Jazz were again led by the duo of Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors. Favors had a team-high of 27 points (10-16 FG, 7-10 FT), while also pulling in 11 rebounds as well. It was one of his best games of the season, but their wasn't enough production elsewhere in order to turn his performance into a win. Hayward on the other hand didn't necessarily have his best shooting night (6-17 FG, 0-5 3Pt), but he was able to convert on 12-of-13 free throws, giving him 24 points at the finish. After struggling to nine points on Saturday against the Timberwolves, it was good to see him turn things back around. Dante Exum got the start at point guard and finished with 13 points (5-14 FG, 3-9 3Pt) in 29 minutes, while Rudy Gobert started at center and finished with 11 points (4-5 FG, 3-6 FT) in 29 minutes of his own. The Pacers' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (27-8) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (11-24) 98-94 on Monday at the Moda Center in Portland.In a surprisingly even showing, the Trail Blazers were just barely able to sneak out the win against a Lakers team that came into this matchup losing seven of their last 10. The Blazers were able to use a strong fourth quarter though, out-scoring the Lakers 28-21, therefore securing the win in front of the home crowd Monday.Like has been the case so many times this season already, Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge led the Blazers to this victory. Lillard went 12-for-21 from the floor and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 39 points, while also adding six rebounds and five assists. He was also able to convert on 11-of-13 attempts at the free throw line, as he consistently forced his way to the line. Aldridge on the other hand went 8-for-20 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while grabbing eight rebounds. Over his last six games, he's averaging 26.3 points, so he continues to be extremely effective for the Blazers. The only other player to reach double figures in points was Meyers Leonard, who went a surprising 4-for-5 from the floor and 3-for-4 from beyond the arc to score 12 points. He pulled in 12 rebounds as well, giving him hist first double-double of the year.With Kobe Bryant sitting this one out, starting center Jordan Hill rode the hot hand, finishing with 23 points (10-15 FG, 3-4 FT) and 14 rebounds. The 23 points matched a season-high for Hill, while the double-double was his thirteenth of the year. Wayne Ellington filled in as the starting shooting guard and finished with 13 points (5-12 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and five rebounds. He played a lot more minutes than normal, and seemingly cashed in on the extra time with a solid overall game. Coming off the bench Jeremy Lin had 14 points (5-10 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-6 FT). He's played well of late, averaging 14.7 points over his last three games. Nick Young struggled with his shot in this one, going only 3-for-13 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score 11 points.   The Trail Blazers' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Thursday, while the Lakers will be the away team against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors beat the Oklahoma City Thunder in dominating fashion Monday, winning by a score of 117-91. Despite scoring 117 points Monday, the big story out of the Bay Area was the Warriors' suffocating defense. Oklahoma was held to just 30.6% shooting from the floor, one of the worst shooting performances by any team this season. The Warriors built a commanding lead from the early going and never looked back as they led by 20 or more points for much of the game.The Thunder came out flat despite being well rested, having last played Friday at home against the Wizards. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook shot a combined 8-37 from the floor with Westbrook needing 21 shots to get to 22 points on the night. Durant did not look fully healthy as his ankle appeared to be bothering him. The Thunder will look to shake off this crushing loss on Wednesday when they play the Kings in Sacramento. The Warriors put on a clinic against the Thunder as they secured their fourth straight win. Not only did Steph Curry and Klay Thompson score 19 apiece, the Warriors also got solid games from Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, and Justin Holiday. Golden State will look to continue its hot streak on Wednesday when it hosts the Pacers.

												The Atlanta Hawks (26-8) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (23-12) 107-98 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.After going into the half down two points, the Hawks were able to have a very strong second half, out-scoring the Clippers 63-52, therefore allowing them the nine-point victory. The win marks the fifth straight for Atlanta. While both teams shot similar percentages from the field, the biggest difference may have came in the turnover category, as the Hawks forced the Clippers into 21, while only committing 12 of their own.The Hawks were led by the duo of Paul Millsap and Jeff Teague. Millsap finished with a team-high of 23 points (8-16 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-7 FT), while also adding eight rebounds. He's now combined for 50 points over his last two games, so he continues to ride the hot hand. Teague on the other hand went 6-for-13 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding nine assists and four steals. Like Millsap, he's also had a hot hand of late and is averaging 23.2 points over his last five games. The four steals marked a season-high for him as well. Al Horford had a strong showing, posting 16 points (7-15 FG, 2-2 FT) and five rebounds, while DeMarre Carroll got hot from the field and finished with an efficient 17 points (6-8 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 2-6 FT).The Clippers were led by an impressive performance from Blake Griffin, who neared a triple-double with 26 points (6-17 FG), 10 rebounds and six assists. He forced his way to the free throw line 18 times, and converted on 14-of-18. He's now averaging 22.4 points and 7.6 rebounds on the season. DeAndre Jordan was able to to notch a double-double and went a perfect 7-of-7 from the field to score 15 points and grab 16 rebounds. It was his thirteenth game in a row with 10 or more rebounds. Chris Paul had a double-double of his own, as he recorded 10 points (4-9 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 10 assists. It was his second double-double in a row, despite not coming near is season scoring average. J.J. Reddick was another top scorer, as he had 14 points (5-9 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT) in 35 minutes. While their scoring was spread even throughout the team, they didn't play enough defense in order to get the victory.The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday, while the Clippers will play the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday.

												The Mavericks (25-10) handled the LeBron-less Cavaliers (19-15) 109-90 on Sunday in Cleveland. The Mavericks scorched the nets to the tune of 56 percent shooting and converted 12-of-26 three-point field goals. Monta Ellis led the way with 20 points and two assists, while Dirk Nowitzki added 15 points and five boards. Tyson Chandler and Chandler Parsons each scored 14 points, and Rajon Rondo finished with four points, four rebounds and eight assists. Dallas was out-rebounded 38-36 but was able to control Cleveland’s transition game, holding the Cavaliers without a single fast-break point. Playing without LeBron James for the fourth straight game, Cleveland leaned heavily upon Kevin Love, who posted 30 points and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. Matthew Dellavedova added 10 points, and Shawn Marion had 13 off the bench. No other Cavaliers player scored in double-figures. Kyrie Irving, who finished with six points in 25 minutes, departed the game in the second half due to lower back soreness and did not return. Cleveland shot just 41 percent from the field and converted 8-of-25 three-pointers. Up next, Cleveland travels to Philadelphia to take on the 76ers on Monday. Dallas heads east to Brooklyn to take on the Nets, also on Monday.

												The Detroit Pistons (10-23) defeated the Sacramento Kings (14-20) 114-95 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.The Pistons used both their superior shooting and strong fourth quarter play, to power past the Kings at home in front of their home crowd. The Pistons shot 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 43 percent from the field and only 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pistons were also able to take home the rebounding advantage, as they out-rebounded the Kings 49-41. Surprisingly, Detroit has now won five straight games.Brandon Jennings had himself a day against Sacramento. He went 14-for-21 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to finish with 35 points in 30 minutes. Jennings has gone on a scoring tear over his past two outings, combining for 64 points over that span, as he's been a big reason for the teams recent success. Andre Drummond also had a big night. He recorded 15 points (6-11 FG, 3-5 FT), 14 rebounds and two blocks, giving him his third double-double in the last four games. He's also now recorded double digit rebounds in 11 out of his last 12 games. Greg Monroe was able to record a double-double of his own. He finished with 14 points (6-10 FG, 2-4 FT) and 11 rebounds, notching him his second double-double in a row. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Jodie Meeks, who came off the bench for 13 points (5-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT).The Kings on the other hand continued to be led by superstar DeMarcus Cousins, who finished with a team-high of 18 points (5-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 8-11 FT) and 15 rebounds. It marked his fourth double-double over the last five games, and pushes his season averages to 23.8 points and 12.0 rebounds per game. Cousins wasn't the only one to find success despite the loss. Darren Collison went 5-for-7 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while also adding six rebounds and three steals. While he didn't get many shots off, he was very efficient on the ones he did. Rudy Gay didn't have his best night shooting (5-16 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) but was still able to contribute 12 points and five rebounds in 35 minutes. Ben McLemore also had a poor outing with his shot, as he went only 2-for-11 from the field and a 0-for-6 from the beyond the arc to score 11 points. He got most of his points from the free throw line where he went a perfect 7-of-7. Off the bench, both Ray McCallum and Derrick Williams had 10 and 12 points respectively.  The Pistons' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday, while the Kings will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (15-20) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (16-17) 88-84 on Sunday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.The Heat came out hot in this game, out-scoring the Nets 30-21 in the first quarter. The Nets continued to claw back throughout the whole game, but in the end the Heat were able to hold them off and secure the victory in front of their home crowd. The Heat shot 46 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Nets finished at 40 percent from the floor and only 29 percent from beyond the arc.The Heat were again led by their dynamic duo of Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. Bosh had a fantastic night shooting, going 10-for-16 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to finish with 26 points and five rebounds. He's now pushed his season averages to 21.3 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. Wade on the other hand recorded 25 points (9-20 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-9 FT), six rebounds, and seven assists, doing a little bit of everything for the Heat in this one. He's now had 25 points or more in four out of his last six games. The Nets just didn't have a defensive answer to keep the pair in check. In a surprise performance off the bench, Hassan Whiteside went 5-for-7 from the field to score 11 points, while also notching 10 rebounds, giving him his first double-double of the season. He's now reached double-digit points in two straight games, after failing to do that all season long.The Nets received their biggest contribution from Joe Johnson, who went 8-for-22 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 19 points. With Deron Williams and Brook Lopez continuing to come off the bench in limited minutes, Johnson has taken it on himself to get off the bulk of the shots for this team. Williams played 26 minutes off the bench in this one, finishing with 13 points, six rebounds and eight assists. He came quite near a triple-double, as he was very efficient in his limited time on the court. Lopez notched 25 minutes of his own, going 6-for-11 from the field to score 16 points, while also adding seven rebounds. He's combined for 32 points and 15 rebounds over the last two outings, despite not playing his normal amount of minutes. Mirza Teletovic also was able to reach double figures in points with 14 (5-15 FG, 4-11 3Pt, 0-2) off the bench.The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday, while the Nets will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (18-17) defeated the New York Knicks (5-31) 95-82 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Bucks were able to have a great night defensively, giving themselves the scoring advantage in all four quarters. The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out-rebounded the Knicks 48-36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13-point victory on the road.Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6-for-14 from the field and 1-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6-12 FG, 4-4 FT) and a team-high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double-double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster weren't able to limit him. Notching a double-double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6-9 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season-high, while it was his second double-double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6-for-8 from the field and 3-for-3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes.The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6-for-13 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he didn't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6-10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3-11 FG, 4-4 FT).The Bucks' next game will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, while the Knicks will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Monday.

												The Phoenix Suns (20-16) defeated the Toronto Raptors (24-10) 125-109 on Sunday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.The Suns were hot right from the beginning in this one, having an outstanding first half where they out-scored the Raptors 70-53. They finished the game shooting 54 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors shot 46 percent from the floor and 35 percent from beyond the arc. The Suns had a solid defensive effort, and forced the Raptors into 21 turnovers.As a whole, the Suns got scoring from all over the place, with seven players reaching double figures in points. Eric Bledsoe led the team, going 7-for-12 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding eight assists. This outing caps off a strong week and a half offensively for Bledsoe, who's averaged 21.8 points over his last five games. Goran Dragic also had a strong shooting display, as he went 8-for-11 from the field and 2-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in 28 minutes. After struggling with his shot on Friday against the 76ers, it was good to see him turn things around, and give the Suns their very effective backcourt duo back. Coming off the bench, Isaiah Thomas had a very efficient outing, scoring 18 points (6-10 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and adding five steals. Not really known for his defensive presence, the five steals were a season-high for him. Also, in only 15 minutes, Alex Len scored 10 points (5-6 FG) of his own.The Raptors saw an extremely strong showing by Jonas Valanciunas, who posted 21 points (9-14 FG, 3-4 FT) and 10 rebounds. The double-double pushed his season averages to 12.3 points and 8.5 rebounds per game on the year. Kyle Lowry continued to excel offensively with the absence of DeMar DeRozan. Lowry went 6-for-17 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also contributing seven assists and two steals. Over his last six outings, he's averaging an impressive 25.8 points per game. Coming off the bench both Louis Williams (4-10 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 7-7 FT) and James Johnson (7-9 FG, 3-4 FT) had 17 points apiece. Terrence Ross was the other Raptor to reach double figures, as he had 12 points (5-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and six rebounds.  The Suns' next game will be on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday, while the Raptors will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (11-23) defeated the Indiana Pacers (13-22) 88-87 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.After ending the third quarter down 69-63, the Lakers went on a 25-18 run in the fourth quarter to complete a comeback victory in front of their home crowd. Despite being out-rebounded 50-37 by the Pacers, the Lakers were able to force them into 16 turnovers, which may have been the difference in this one. Both teams struggled with their shooting percentages for the most part.Nick Young and Kobe Bryant did most of the damage for the Lakers. Young didn't have his best shooting night of the year, but finished with 22 points (4-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and three rebounds off the bench. He was able to go a perfect 12-of-12 from the free throw line, as he continually forced his way to the line. Bryant on the other hand went 7-for-14 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding six rebounds, six assists and three steals. He did a little bit of everything in this game, along with making the go-ahead jumper with just over 12 seconds left in the game. Carlos Boozer was also productive off the bench, scoring 12 points (5-9 FG, 2-2 FT) and grabbing four rebounds. Both Jeremy Lin and Ed Davis reached double-digits in points as well, with 10 and 11 points respectively.  The Pacers had all five starters reach double figures in points, but received their biggest contribution off the bench from CJ Miles. Miles went 7-for-18 from the field and 3-for-9 from the three-point line to score 19 points in 31 minutes. He's really stepped it up lately, averaging 22 points over his last three outings. Donald Slan started at guard and came just shy of a triple-double, finishing with 16 points (6-14 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 3-4 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. The nine assists were a season-high, as he's received a boost in playing time over his last few games. Roy Hibbert stayed effective and recorded 12 points (5-12 FG, 2-2 FT) and 11 rebounds.

												The Charlotte Hornets (11-24) had revenge on the mind after losing the previous two contests against the Orlando Magic (13-24). They used a 22-0 first-half run to propel them to a 98-90 victory and end a five-game losing streak. Channing Frye didn't play the second half due to a strained right elbow. The Hornets jumped out to a 52-29 halftime lead, limiting the Magic to nine points in the second quarter and their season low in points scored for a half. The Magic stayed competitive by not committing a turnover in the second half and outscoring the Hornets 50-34 in the paint. Kemba Walker contributed 30 points, seven rebounds, six assists, two steals, one block, and four three-pointers in 39 minutes without the services of Al Jefferson (groin) and Lance Stephenson (pelvis). Michael Kidd-Gilchrist recorded his fourth double-double of the season, 17 points and 12 rebounds in 36 minutes, as the only other Hornet to play more than 30 minutes. Jefferson's replacement, Bismack Biyombo, was held scoreless in 17 minutes.The Magic shot 38 percent from the field and are now mired in a three-game losing streak. Nikola Vucevic recorded his 18th double-double, tallying  20 points (8-16 FG, 4-4 FT), 10 rebounds, two assists, one steal, and two blocks in 35 minutes. Rookie Elfrid Payton was unable to follow his near triple-double from Friday with a similar performance, providing seven points, seven assists, three rebounds, and two steals in 35 minutes.The Magic rest for three days before starting a four-game road trip in Denver on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets (23-10) defeated the Miami Heat (14-20) 115-79 on Saturday.Houston got back on track with the big win after trudging through three losses over their previous four games. Josh Smith was in the starting lineup for their recent poor stretch, and coach Kevin McHale moved Smith back to a bench role Saturday, allowing the team to go back to the lineup they had success with before Smith was signed. Donatas Motiejunas reclaimed his starting spot at power forward and put up 12 points and three assists in 27 minutes. Smith finished with 12 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench. James Harden scored a game-high 28 points in just 28 minutes. Houston will begin a three-game road trip against the Chicago Bulls on Monday.Miami has lost four straight games, but it's difficult to see why the team is struggling.

The Heat gave up 22 points on 22 turnovers, were out-rebounded 46-33 and shot just 24 percent from beyond the arc, putting themselves out of contention Saturday. They'll return home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (25-8) beat the Portland Trail Blazers (26-8) on Saturday at the Moda Center by a score of 115-107.The Hawks led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter, but the Trail Blazers began chipping into Atlanta's lead later in the third, cutting the deficit to eight points. The Trail Blazers closed the margin to six points late in the fourth quarter, but Atlanta's lead proved insurmountable.Atlanta has become one of the hottest teams in the league, having won nine of its last ten games, including four straight. The Hawks shot well from the field, sporting a 51.2 field goal percentage. Atlanta also got solid contributions from its bench players, highlighted by Thabo Sefolosha's double-double. The Hawks will wrap up their Western Conference road trip on Monday when they play the Clippers. Portland had its four-game win streak snapped Saturday despite coming into the game on three days of rest. Big man Joel Freeland injured his right shoulder in the game and did not return. However, LaMarcus Aldridge had an excellent game with 30 points and 12 rebounds.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (23-11) beat the Philadelphia 76ers (4-28) on Saturday by a score of 127-91. The Clippers started to open up a sizable lead over the 76ers early in the game, but Philadelphia managed to cut Los Angeles' lead to four mid way through the third quarter. Los Angeles responded with a 20-8 run to put the game out of reach, however. Philadelphia has lost five games in a row, all of which have been by double digits. The 76ers were playing the second half of a back-to-back set which started Friday with a 112-96 loss at Phoenix. Guard Tony Wroten turned in another nice game, however, scoring 27 points and pulling down seven rebounds. Philadelphia will take the floor next when it hosts Cleveland on Monday.Los Angeles came into this game with two full days of rest and easily handled the 76ers. Five different bench players played at least 10 minutes and no starter logged more than 30 minutes on the floor. The Clippers are now 3-1 on their current home stand and will host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (19-14) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (10-24) 91-87 on Friday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.Both teams struggled with their shooting in this one. The Cavaliers went 38 percent from the floor and 27 percent from the three-point line, while the Hornets went only 37 percent from the floor and 21 percent from beyond the arc. Neither team could really get in a groove, as both failed to reach the 100-point mark. Cleveland was able to force Charlotte into 15 turnovers, which ultimately may have been the difference.With LeBron James out for the next couple of weeks, as expected Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving took over the majority of the offensive production. Love led all scorers, as he went 9-for-15 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to finish with 27 points. After struggling to only seven points on Tuesday, it was good to see him bounce back with an outstanding performance Friday. Irving didn't have his most efficient day, but ended up scoring 23 points (8-27 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 7-8 FT) in 41 minutes. Over his last five games he's averaged 27.4 points, so expect him to continue to get of plenty of shots as his confidence level is through the roof. Dion Waiters had a solid contribution off the bench, as he finished with 17 points and five rebounds. He had 17 of  the 24 total bench points for the Cavs. The only other player to reach double figures was Tristan Thompson. He recorded a double-double, as he had 14 points and 14 rebounds.The Hornets top scorer was Gerald Henderson. Henderson went 6-for-17 from the floor to score 14 points, while also adding eight rebounds and four assists. He's combined for 49 points over his last three games, as he's stepped up his scoring output during the past week. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was able to add a double-double of his own. He had 12 points and 10 rebounds, giving him his third double-double of the season. Kemba Walker seemed to struggle with his shot. He went only 4-for-16 from the field and 1-for-8 from the three-point line to score 10 points. Coming off the bench, both Gary Neal and Marvin Williams reach double-digit points with 11 and 10 points respectively. As a team though, the Hornets just didn't have enough offensive production to get them a victory.The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, while the Hornets will travel to Orlando to play the Magic on Saturday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (16-16) defeated the Orlando Magic (13-23) 100-98 on Friday at the Amway Center in Orlando.After a second and third quarter where the Nets combined to out-score the Magic 64-36, they entered the fourth riding a 25-point lead. The Magic weren't done though, and went on a huge fourth quarter comeback, pulling all the way back to within two points. Their comeback effort came up just short though, as they just didn't have enough time to complete it. The Nets used superior shooting in this one, as they went 57 percent from the field compared to the Magic who went just 42 percent from the floor.The Nets continued to bring both Brook Lopez and Deron Williams off the bench, as they they both came in on a minutes restriction. Williams seemed to get a much longer run Friday, as he played 29 minutes compared to playing closer to 20 minutes the last four games. He cashed in on the extra time, going 5-for-10 from the field and 3-for-3 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also handing out seven assists. Lopez on the other hand played just 17 minutes, but was very efficient with his time on the court and recorded 16 points (7-8 FG, 2-3 FT) and eight rebounds. He was placed in the starting lineup on Tuesday because of an injury to Kevin Garnett, but was reduced to a bench role again with his return. Mason Plumlee also had a strong game and continued to start at center. He went 9-for-10 from the field to score a team-high of 18 points, while also grabbing nine rebounds and adding two blocks.The Magic got help from all over the place, with seven players reaching double figures in points. Victor Oladipo led the team, going 7-for-13 from the field and 2-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 17 points. He's improved his scoring of late, and is now averaging 18.3 points per game over his last three outings. Rookie Elfrid Payton had one of his best games of his career thus far. He came just shy of his first ever triple-double, as he finished with 16 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. The nine rebounds matched a season-high, while it was his second double-double of the year. Ben Gordon also gave a solid contribution off the bench. He went 5-for-9 from the field and 1-for3 from the three-point line to score 14 points in 19 minutes. Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic had 12 and 10 points respectively.The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Miami Heat on Sunday, while the Magic will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (24-10) defeated the Boston Celtics (11-19) 119-101 on Friday at the TD Garden in Boston.The Mavericks had a strong first quarter where they out-scored the Celtics 31-17. With the strong start, they were able to use that momentum and coast through the rest of the game to finish with an 18-point victory. The Mavericks out-rebounded the Celtices 53-38, giving them a huge advantage in that category. That advantage may have given them just enough to steal the win on the road.The Mavericks were led by their backcourt of Rajon Rondo and Monta Ellis. Rondo had a very impressive game, going 12-for-19 from the field and 5-for-7 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 29 points. He also added six rebounds and five assists. It was far and away his best game so far with the Mavericks and it just so happened to be against his former team in Boston. Ellis on the other hand went 8-for-17 from the floor and 2-for-3 from beyond the arc to finish with 22 points. He's now averaging 20.7 points and 4.5 assists per game on the season. Dirk Nowitzki had a solid all-around game. He recorded 17 points (7-19 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT), seven rebounds and four assists in 30 minutes of action. After a poor shooting night on Tuesday against the Wizards, it was good to see him get back on track. Chandler Parsons also reached double figures with 13 points (4-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and seven rebounds.Avery Bradley did most of the damage for the Celtics. He went 9-for-20 from the floor and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 22 points. He's only averaging 12.3 points per game thus far in the season, so it was a nice surprise for the Celtics to receive this kind of scoring output from Bradley. Jeff Green also did his part on the offensive side of the ball. He went 7-for-15 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 18 points. After Rondo was sent to the Mavericks in a trade, Green has been one of the players relied upon to make up for his scoring production. Posting his third double-double of the season, Tyler Zeller recorded 17 points and 10 rebounds. It was an impressive line for him as he was in a very tough matchup with Tyson Chandler. Jared Sullinger was the only other Celtic in double figures, as he finished with 12 points in 34 minutes.  The Mavericks' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, while the Celtics will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Saturday.

												The Detroit Pistons (9-23) defeated the New York Knicks (5-30) 97-81 on Friday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Pistons had a strong first half, out-scoring the Knicks 57-38. With the strong start, they were able to coast through the second half and secure a 16-point victory. The Pistons shot well in this one, going 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line, while the Knicks went only 35 percent from the field and 42 percent from beyond the arc.Brandon Jennings had himself a game Friday. In only 24 minutes, Jennings went 11-for-17 from the floor and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 29 points. It was a nice bounce back game for him after scoring only five points against the Orlando Magic on Tuesday. Jodie Meeks provided a big contribution off the bench. He scored 15 points (6-13 FG, 3-7 3Pt) in 25 minutes. Meeks is coming off a 34-point outing on Tuesday, so he continued to ride his hot hand and had another good showing Friday. While he didn't have much of an offensive impact, Andre Drummond was a monster on the boards. He finished with 20 rebounds, marking the second game in a row and fifth time this season recording at least 20 rebounds. He's now averaging 13 rebounds per game on the season. Greg Monroe had 12 points and 10 rebounds of his own, giving him his tenth double-double of the season.Without Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire or Samuel Dalembert in the lineup, the Knicks were really thin. J.R. Smith was about the only bright spot for them, as he went 8-for-20 from the field and 5-for-9 from the three-point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes. He was in the starting lineup for only the fifth time this season, and he capitalized on his opportunity. The only other Knick to reach double figures was Cole Aldrich. He started at center and finished with 11 points and 14 rebounds. It marked his third double-double of the season. With all the injuries and only two players reaching double-digit points, the Knicks just didn't have the offensive fire power to stay within reach.  The Pistons' next game will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, while the Knicks will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (17-16) defeated the Houston Rockets (24-10) 111-83 on Friday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Pelicans really dominated all aspects of this game. To begin with, they were the superior shooters, going 53 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line compared to the Rockets who went 40 percent from the floor and only 21 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans also established a hefty rebounding advantage, finishing with 49 compared to the 38 recorded by the Rockets. The Pelicans also got to the free throw line nine more times, converting on 16-of-20 at the line.While hard to believe, Anthony Davis wasn't a huge factor in the Pelicans' victory. He finished with only seven points and eight rebounds. Instead, the Pelicans received most of their production from Tyreke Evans and Ryan Anderson. Evans had a very impressive night, going 10-for-15 from the field to score 21 points, while also adding five assists and four rebounds. Over his last four games, he's now averaging 21.5 points, as he's had the hot hand of late. Anderson on the other hand came off the bench to shoot 9-for-14 from the field and 3-for-6 from beyond the arc while scoring 22 points in 24 minutes. With that performance, Anderson continues to prove himself as one of the most consistent sixth men in the league. Also coming off the bench, both Dante Cunningham and Jimmer Fredette had 13 and 10 points respectively.For the Rockets, neither James Harden, nor Trevor Ariza had their usual output. Harden had only 11 points (5-13 FG, 1-6 3Pt) and three assists, marking his worst game offensively since mid-November. Considering he's averaging 27.2 points per game this year, it was a very dissapointing day for Rockets' fans. Ariza on the other hand shot only 1-for-5 from the field and 0-for-2 from the three-point line to finish with a meager two points. With both Harden and Ariza struggling, the Rockets just didn't have their usual offensive burst. Dwight Howard and Corey Brewer led the team in points with 12 points each. The only other Rocket to reach double figures was Donatas Motiejunas, who contributed 10 points and six rebounds.  The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Rockets will be at home against the Miami Heat on Saturday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (17-17) defeated the Washington Wizards (22-10) 109-102 on Friday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.Following the third quarter, this game was tied and anyones game for the taking. The Thunder took it upon themselves and were able to out-score the Wizards by seven in the final quarter to seal the victory in front of their home crowd. They shot 53 percent from the field, while the Wizards shot 46 percent from the field, which was just enough of an advantage to secure the victory.Boy do the Thunder enjoy having Kevin Durant back. Durant went 12-for-18 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score 34 points, while also adding eight rebounds. Durant has been scoring at an insane rate over his last three games, as he's averaging 36 points per game over that span. If Durant can keep this pace, he'll have the Thunder sitting pretty come playoffs. Russell Westbrook also did his part. Westbrook finished with 22 points and six assists, giving him new season averages of 27.3 points and 7.1 assists per game on the year. Although he's not posting the numbers he did when Durant was sidelined, he's still continuing to have a very high production on the offensive side of the ball. Serge Ibaka had a solid contribution. He went 6-for-10 from the field to score 13 points, while adding six rebounds in the process. Despite his scoring opportunities going down with both Durant and Westbrook healthy, he's also able to feed off the extra defensive attention given to those two. The only other Thunder player to reach double figures in points was Nick Collison, who came off the bench to score 10 points in 16 minutes.The Wizards received their biggest contribution from Bradley Beal. Beal went 7-for-15 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 21 points. He also came pretty close to a triple-double with 10 rebounds and six assists. the 10 rebounds were a season-high for Beal, as it was also his first double-double of the season. Wall had a pretty good game as well. He finished with 14 points (5-13 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and 12 assists, as he continues to find his teammates at a spectacular rate. Coming off the bench, Andre Miller had arguably his best game of the season with 15 points (5-9 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds. After averaging only 4.3 points per game up until this point, it was a nice surprise for the Wizards. Both Paul Pierce and Nene Hilario finished with 12 points each.  The Thunders' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Monday, while the Wizards will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Saturday.

												The Indiana Pacers (13-21) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (17-17) 94-91 on Friday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.Despite the Bucks finishing the third quarter up 68-66, the Pacers were able to out-score Milwaukee 28-23 in the final quarter to secure a close three-point victory in a tough conference road game. While both teams finished at 43 percent from the field, the Pacers were better from the three-point line, as they shot 40 percent from deep, while the Bucks shot just 29 percent.Roy Hibbert was a force in this one, as the Bucks didn't have much of an answer for him. Hibbert went 6-for-11 from the field and a perfect 6-for-6 from the free throw line to score 18 points, while also adding seven rebounds. Hibbert is only averaging 11 points so far this season, so it was good to see him heat up a little bit against a mostly inexperienced Bucks front line. The Pacers did receive a couple of big contributions off the bench. Leading all scorers, C.J. Miles went 8-for-14 from the field and 6-for-9 from the three-point line to score 22 points in 32 minutes. He's now combined for 47 points over the last two games, as he's taken it upon himself to give the Pacers another proven scorer. Luis Scola also had an efficient game off the bench. He had 14 points (7-9 FG, 0-2 FT) and five rebounds in only 17 minutes. The only other Pacer to reach double figures in points was Rodney Stuckey, who had 11 points.The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight, as he went 9-for-19 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding seven assists and four steals. Knight continues to be one of the more reliable offensive threats for the Bucks and has now combined for 46 points over his last two outings. He's averaging 18.1 points and 5.1 assists on the year. Zaza Puchilia did everything he could to combat Hibbert. Pachulia finished with a double-double, posting 12 points and 14 rebounds. It was only his third double-double of the year. Also with a double-double, John Henson came off the bench for 14 points and 10 rebounds. Henson was very efficient as he did this in only 23 minutes. It was arguably his best game of the year considering he set season-highs in both points and rebounds.The Pacers' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, while the Bucks will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Sunday. 											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Indiana,Pacers,Fiserv Forum,13,21,17,17,7.0,24.0,38.0,89.0,8.0,10.0,43.0,28.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Giannis Antetokounmpo,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,32,Solomon Hill,5.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,35,Johnny O'Bryant III,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,David West,8.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,30,Zaza Pachulia,14.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Roy Hibbert,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Khris Middleton,8.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,30,Rodney Stuckey,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,27,Brandon Knight,2.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,19.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,32,Donald Sloan,8.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,33,Jared Dudley,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,22,CJ Miles,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,22.0,8.0,14.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,32,John Henson,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,14.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Lavoy Allen,5.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,O.J.

												The Phoenix Suns (19-16) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (4-27) 112-96 on Friday the U.S. Airways Center in Phoenix.The Suns had a very strong second half on Friday, out-scoring the Sixers 55-37 over that span. They were able to use superior shooting all game, going 50 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line compared to the Sixers who shot 43 percent from the field and only 27 percent from beyond the arc. To add to that, the Suns also out-rebounded the Sixers 48-41 giving them even more of an advantage in securing a victory in front of their home crowd.The Suns were led by Markieff Morris and Gerald Green. Morris had a very strong game shooting the ball, going 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 21 points in 21 minutes. He's now combined for 46 points over his last two outings, continuing to show the hot hand. Green on the other hand came off the bench for 21 points (9-15 FG, 3-7 3Pt) of his own. He's been a consistent option for the Suns off the bench, as he's now averaging 13.9 points per game this year. Eric Bledsoe had a strong showing as well. He went 6-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while also recording eight assists. Over his last four games he's averaging 22.3 points and 6.8 assists per game, so he's played a big part in the Suns' success. Goran Dragic had a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.The Sixers' guards had a big day. Coming off the bench, Tony Wroten went off. He shot a ridiculous 10-for-19 from the field and 4-for-9 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 28 points. He's now averaging 16.9 points on the season. Michael Carter-Williams also had a solid all-around game. He finished with 17 points (8-20 FG, 1-4 3Pt), seven rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes. He had a very poor showing on Tuesday against the Golden State Warriors, where he had only four points in 38 minutes, so it was nice bounce back game for him. Henry Sims was another strong bench contributor. He went 6-for-7 from the field to score 16 points. He's combined for 35 points over his last two games despite averaging only 10 points on the season.The Suns' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday, while the Sixers will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Saturday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (24-8) defeated the Utah Jazz (11-22) 98-92 on Friday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.Notching their third victory in a row, the Hawks were able to hold off a fourth quarter comeback attempt from the Jazz. The Hawks were the superior shooters in this one, going 41 percent from the field compared to the Jazz who went just 37 percent. Free throws were also a factor, as Atlanta went 26-for-30 from the line, while Utah went 18-for-24 from the line. With the superior shooting and the free throw advantage, the Hawks were able to secure a cross-conference road victory.The Hawks were led by Jeff Teague in this one. Teague went 9-for-17 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to finish with 26 points and eight assists. Over his last three outings, he's now averaging 24.7 points and 8.7 assists per game as the unquestioned offensive leader of this team. Paul Millsap also had a productive game despite going only 2-for-11 from the field. He scored 15 points, but most of it came from the free throw line where he went a perfect 10-of-10 on the night. Along with the 15 points, he added 11 rebounds, giving him his eigth double-double of the year. The other two Hawks to reach double figures in points were Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll, as they finished with 13 and 10 points respectively.Gordon Hayward had the biggest day for the Jazz. He went 6-for-14 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to have a team-high of 18 points. It wasn't quite on par with his two previous games, where he recorded 26 and 22 points, but on a night where the team as a whole really struggled, it was the best that he could do. He's now averaging 19.2 points and 5.1 rebounds on the year. Rookie Dante Exum had one of his better offensive outings of the year. He had a career-high of 13 points (5-9 FG, 3-7 3Pt), while also chipping in two rebounds two assists and another career-high of three steals. He's only reached double figures in points four other times this season, so it was somewhat of a surprise performance. Enes Kanter and Rudy Gobert had 11 points each.  The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday, while the Jazz will travel to Minnesota to play the Timberwolves on Saturday.

												The Golden State Warriors (26-5) defeated the Toronto Raptors (24-9) 126-105 on Friday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.Coming into this game, this was a matchup between the leaders of each respective conference. The Warriors weren't phased though, and dominated the Raptors in all aspects of the game. The Warriors shot better, going 53 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line, while the Raptors went 47 percent from the floor and 40 percent from beyond the arc. The Warriors also out-rebounded them 45-37 and topped it off by forcing the Raptors into 17 turnovers.The Warriors backcourt was very effective in this one. Stephen Curry went 10-for-18 from the field and 5-for-11 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 32 points, while also adding 12 assists. It was his seventh double-double of the season and he's now averaging 22.8 points and 7.7 assists on the year. The other member of the backcourt, Klay Thompson, also did his part. He went 8-for-13 from the floor and 4-for-6 from beyond the arc to finish with 20 points. With both Curry and Thompson shooting so well, the Raptors just couldn't find anyone who could slow them down. In his second surprise performance in a row, Marreese Speights finished with 26 points (12-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds. He had 23 points on Tuesday as well, so considering he's averaging only 12.2 points on the year, they were both quite surprising finishes for the forward. Draymond Green had himself a day as well though, notching his first triple-double of the year. He finished with 16 points (6-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), 13 assists and 11 rebounds.While they couldn't figure out a defense that could keep the Warriors in check, the Raptors were able to score in bunches of their own, as they had three players reach the 20-point mark. Two of them surprisingly were off the bench in Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams, while the other not-so-surprisingly was Kyle Lowry, who's been most relied upon without DeMar DeRozan in the lineup. Vasquez had a team-high with 25 points (10-19 FG, 5-9 3Pt, 0-1 FT), while also adding seven assists and five rebounds. It was arguably his best game of the season, as both the points and assists were season-highs. Lowry had 22 points (8-17 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and eight assists of his own. He's averaging 27.2 points over his last five games, so it wasn't all too surprising that he continues to be one of the main offensive contributors for this team. Finally, Williams had 20 points, as he went 6-for-14 from the floor and 7-for-7 from the free throw line.The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday, while the Raptors will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Sunday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (24-8) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (10-23) 109-106 on Friday.Memphis extended their win streak to three games with the victory. Zach Randolph sat out a sixth straight game, giving Jon Leuer another spot start at power forward. The Grizzlies shot 49 percent from the field and 43 percent from beyond the arc with Mike Conley leading the way on offense with a team-high 19 points and nine assists in 32 minutes. Marc Gasol pitched in with a double-double of 18 points and 10 rebounds. Memphis currently sits at third place in the Western Conference standings and will continue their road trip against the Denver Nuggets on Saturday.Los Angeles has lost four of their last five games as they have struggled to find a proper balance on both sides of the court all season. Jeremy Lin led the way Friday, putting up 20 points and five assists in 28 minutes off the bench. Ed Davis pitched in 20 points and eight rebounds in 28 minutes as the starting power forward. Davis was playing through a broken nose that he suffered in their last game and was wearing a protective mask. The Lakers are in second to last place in the Western Conference and will stay home to host the Indiana Pacers on Sunday.

												The Bulls (23-10) held off the Denver Nuggets (13-20) on Thursday by a score of 106-101. The Nuggets saw a seemingly comfortable 12-point lead in the third quarter evaporate as the Bulls stormed back to take the lead just before the fourth quarter began. Denver's Aaron Afflalo cut Chicago's lead to five with just over two minutes remaining, but the Bulls responded with baskets from Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson to give them a solid lead. Chicago's Jimmy Butler shined again as he had a game-high 26 points in the Bulls' victory over the Nuggets. Denver had two of their big men banged up on Tuesday night as Kenneth Fareid and Wilson Chandler both were hampered by leg issues, but both managed to play Thursday. Fareid, who had ""dead legs"" Tuesday night didn't show any ill effects against the Bulls as he scored 18 points and pulled down 19 rebounds. Chandler led the Nuggets in scoring with 22 points in 34 minutes on the floor. Denver has now dropped three straight and five of its last six but will look to buck that trend it hosts Memphis on Saturday night. Kirk Hinrich returned to action for Chicago after missing five games with a hamstring injury. He was a perfect 4-for-4 from the floor, including 2-for-2 from beyond the arc as he scored 10 points in 27 minutes. Chicago has now won eight of its last nine games and will continue its five-game homestand on Saturday when the Bulls take on the Celtics.

												The Sacramento Kings (15-19) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-27) 110-107 on Thursday. Sacramento broke their two-game losing streak with the win. Derrick Williams moved into the starting lineup in place of Ryan Hollins, giving Kings fans the first significant change in the team's rotation since Ty Corbin was asked to take over the head coach position and start making changes over two weeks ago. Williams should be used with Rudy Gay at the forward positions to help Sacramento stretch the floor and play at a faster pace. He put up 17 points and five rebounds in 31 minutes. The Kings got what they wanted on offense, shooting 54 percent from the field and 42 percent from beyond the arc, but they let the Timberwolves keep it close by giving away 21 points on 20 turnovers.Minnesota has lost ten straight games, but No. 1 pick Andrew Wiggins has started to show some exciting improvements. He scored a game-high 27 points to go with nine rebounds and four steals in 40 minutes Thursday, and over his last five games, Wiggins has averaged 21.4 points and 4.4 rebounds on 51 percent shooting in 36 minutes per game. Gorgui Dieng helped keep the Timberwolves in the game Thurday, putting up 15 points and 10 rebounds in 30 minutes. The Kings will wrap up their road trip against the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, while the Timberwolves will stay home to host the Utah Jazz on Saturday.

												The Boston Celtics (11-18) defeated the Sacramento Kings (13-19) 106-84 on Wednesday in a matinee matchup.Boston snapped their four-game losing streak with the win. Despite tweaking his ankle near the end of their last game Saturday, Jared Sullinger led the way with 20 points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes. This game got out of reach for the Kings early enough that both teams used most of their benches for significant stretches. The Celtics gained their biggest advantage on defense, holding the Kings to 37 percent shooting from the field while also forcing them into giving up 22 points off 16 turnovers. Evan Turner started at point guard instead of Marcus Smart, who had started the last few games. Turner posted a double-double of 10 points and 11 assists, and Smart played well off the bench, putting up 11 points and six rebounds in 28 minutes. Boston will try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Dallas Mavericks and welcome back Rajon Rondo for his first game in TD Garden as a member of the Mavericks.Sacramento has lost four of their last five games, and their poor performance Wednesday feels like a new low for the mercurial franchise. Jason Thompson started every single game this season coming into Wednesday, but he was moved to the bench in favor of Ryan Hollins and never entered the game. It was believed Thompson might be one of the pieces to fall out of the rotation after the Kings made a coaching change a couple weeks back, but coach Ty Corbin has been slow to make changes, leaving the Kings players questioning what exactly the direction of the team is. They’ll continue their road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday, giving them a quick turnaround and a new opportunity to get moving in the right direction.

												Indiana made a big run in the second half to overcome a nine-point halftime deficit and defeat the Miami Heat by a score of 106-95 on Wednesday.The Heat seemed to be in control through the first two quarters but started to let the game slip away in the third. Indiana scored 15 unanswered points from late in the third until the early fourth, which put them ahead by 11 with 11 minutes to go. Chris Bosh hit a three-pointer to cut Indiana's lead to seven with 2:39 remaining, but Indiana answered with three-pointers from George Hill and C.J. Miles to solidify its lead and seal the game.   Miami (14-19) got 18 points in 38 minutes from Bosh, who was playing in his second game back after missing time with a calf injury. Danny Granger had 14 points in his first game against his former team as a member of the Heat. Miami plays the Rockets in Houston on Saturday. Six of Miami's next seven games are on the road. Indiana (12-21) was aided by big performances from Hill and Miles, who scored 20 and 25 points respectively.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (22-11) defeated the New York Knicks (5-29) 99-78 on Wednesday in a matinee game.Los Angeles has won two straight, and they were led by Blake Griffin, who put up 13 points, seven rebounds and 11 assists in 35 minutes. The Clippers dominated the glass, out-rebounding the Knicks 50-40. They also held New York to an anemic 38 percent shooting from the field and 24 percent from beyond arc. Los Angeles will have another relaxing matchup when they host the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday.New York has lost nine straight games, and this loss may have brought them to a new and unique low. Only one player scored in double digits for them, Carmelo Anthony, who scored 19 points in 29 minutes. Andrea Bargnani made his season debut after being sidelined since training camp with a hamstring injury. He put up nine points and four rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. A lot of the Knicks' troubles are due to their attempt to change the culture their this season, but they've also been hindered by all the injuries they've had to deal with. J.R. Smith (heel) returned to the court, playing 17 minutes off the bench, but they were still without Amar'e Stoudemire (knee), Samuel Dalembert (ankle) and Iman Shumpert (shoulder). New York will try to right the ship when they host the surging Detroit Pistions on Friday.

												The Houston Rockets (22-9) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (10-23) 102-83 on Wednesday.Houston snapped their two-game losing streak with the win. Josh Smith continues to struggle with his shot since moving into the starting lineup three games ago, but he had a productive night in other categories, finishing with a line of five points, four rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks in 28 minutes. The Rockets had a poor showing on offense Wednesday. It was their defense that got the win. They held the Hornets to 38 percent shooting from the field and 17 percent from beyond the arc. Houston will go on the road to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday.Charlotte has lost four straight, and with Al Jefferson (groin) expected to miss at least the next four weeks, it's getting hard to find reasons to think the Hornets could climb back into the playoff conversation this season. Lance Stephenson (pelvic) has started to do some work in practice but isn't considered too close to returning. Most of Charlotte's options in the frontcourt right now are underwhelming, but Michael Kidd-Gilchrist showed up well Wednesday with 16 points and eight rebounds in 28 minutes. They'll return home to host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (17-16) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (18-14) 96-80 on Wednesday.Milwaukee has won two straight games. They were paced by Brandon Knight, who scored a game-high 26 points in 34 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo also threw up an impressive all-around line of 14 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three blocks in 30 minutes. The Bucks protected the ball well (only 10 turnovers) and held the Cavs down on defense to secure the win. Ersan Ilyasova (concussion) and Larry Sanders (illness) did not play. They'll return home to host the Indiana Pacers on Friday.Cleveland has lost three straight games. LeBron James (knee) and Shawn Marion (ankle) have sat out their last two games, and Kevin Love (back spasms) wasn't able to play Wednesday. That doesn't even account for the fact that Anderson Varejao (Achilles) is out for the season. The Cavaliers have essentially been reduced to the team they were last season, relying on suspect defense from most of their players and Kyrie Irving's heroics on offense to try and get wins. Cleveland shot 34 percent from the field and 26 percent from beyond the arc Wednesday. That's not going to get them wins. They'll go on the road to the face the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (20-14) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (16-16) 95-93 in overtime on Wednesday.San Antonio has won two of their last three as they seem to be finally adapating to playing without Kawhi Leonard (hand) and Tony Parker (hamstring) who remain sidelined indefinitely. The return of Patty Mills from shoulder surgery three games ago has given them more help off the bench and more scoring. He put up just seven points in 29 minutes Wednesday, but he was in the starting lineup to begin overtime, showing how highly coach Gregg Popovich thinks of Mills. Manu Ginobili was the heart of the Spurs, finishing with a game-high 26 points that included the game-winning two-point field goal. San Antonio will stay home to host the Washington Wizards on Saturday.New Orleans has been trading wins and losses like coin flips over their last eight games, going 4-4 in that stretch. Both teams struggled from the field Wednesday, but the Pelicans failed with flair on offense, shooting just 38 percent from the field and 29 percent from beyond the arc while giving up 19 easy points off of 17 turnovers. Anthony Davis did his best to carry the team, finishing with 21 points, 12 rebounds and four steals, but it wasn't enough. The Pelicans will return home to host the Houston Rockets on Friday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (16-17) defeated the Phoenix Suns (18-16) 137-134 in overtime on Wednesday.Oklahoma City has won three of their last four games. Kevin Durant returned from a six-game absence due to an ankle sprain and put up a season-high 44 points in 40 minutes. Russell Westbrook was ejected in the second quarter after collecting two technical fouls. He put up 20 points and four assists in 17 minutes before his ejection. Reggie Jackson started the second half at point guard with Westbrook unavailable. In a somewhat surprising development, Serge Ibaka has taken his 41-percent shooting from beyond the arc this season and began upping his attempts. Over his last four games, he's converted at least three three-pointers in each contest. Oklahoma City will stay home to host the Washington Wizards on Friday.Phoenix has lost two straight close games to teams that are immediately trailing them in the Western Conference standings. Eric Bledsoe did his best to keep the Suns in the game, posting a team-high 29 points and eight assists in 42 minutes. Phoenix shot 51 percent from the field, 48 percent from beyond the arc and 83 percent from the charity stripe, but they committed 35 fouls on defense, giving the Thunder 49 trips to the free-throw line for 44 free points, which is likely the reason they lost the game.

												The Magic were routed at home by the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday by a score of 109-86.Detroit's Jodie Meeks stole the show by putting on a three-point clinic, shooting 9-of-11 from deep on his way to scoring a season-high 34 points. Meeks began taking over in the second quarter, where he scored 11 consecutive points for the Pistons to help them take a nine-point lead late in the first half. He received from help from starting center Andre Drummond. Drummond put up a double-double of 17 points and 22 rebounds in 31 minutes. The Pistons have now won their last three games by a combined 56 points, which is all the more impressive considering that they had lost four in a row prior to this current win streak. Detroit will look to extend its winning streak on Friday when they travel to Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks. The Magic were playing their second game in as many days, coming off a win over the Miami Heat on Monday. They entered the fourth quarter down by just ten points, but mustered only three points in the first four minutes of the period while Detroit extended its lead to 19 points. The Magic will play another back-to-back set this weekend when they host the Nets and Hornets on Friday and Saturday respectively.

												The Atlanta Hawks (23-8) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (18-13) 109-101 on Tuesday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.After the Hawks took a 51-41 lead into halftime, the Cavaliers out-scored the Hawks 32-27 in the third quarter to bring the game back to five points. Atlanta was able to close out strong though and finish with an eight-point victory behind their strong shooting, where they went 51 percent from the field compared to Cleveland who went just 44 percent from the field.The Hawks got most of their production from the trio of Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver. Millsap had a team-high of 26 points (10-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 6-6 FT), while also coming one rebond shy of a double-double with nine. He also matched a season-high with three blocks, as he did a little bit of everything in this game. Teague had a solid all-around game as well. He scored 23 points (8-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-10 FG) and handed out 11 assists. It was his third double-double of the season and he's now combined for 48 points and 18 assists over his last two outings. In 40 minutes of action, Korver went 7-for-11 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also grabbing eight rebounds. Coming off the bench, Mike Scott and Dennis Schroder had 12 and 11 points respectively.The Cavaliers came into this game without LeBron James, who sat out with a knee injury. With James out of the lineup, Kyrie Irving had most of the production, going 13-for-27 from the floor and 3-for-10 from beyond the arc to finish with 35 points. He had nine assists and six rebounds, but struggled with turnovers as he added eight of those. Tristan Thompson continued to start at center with Anderson Varejao out for the season. Thompson was very effective in this one, scoring 18 points and grabbing 13 rebounds before fouling out. It was his second consecutive double-double and also back-to-back nights with 18 points. The only other Cavalier to reach double figures in points was Joe Harris, who chipped in 13 (4-7 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) off the bench in 27 minutes.The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Friday, while the Cavaliers will be at home against the Milwuakee Bucks on Wednesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (15-16) defeated the Chicago Bulls (22-10) 96-82 on Tuesday at the United Center in Chicago.The Nets used strong second and third quarters where they combined to out-score the Bulls 60-38 to seal the victory on the road. They shot 43 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line compared to the Bulls who shot just 38 percent from the floor and 32 percent from beyond the arc. Free throws were also a big difference as the Nets converted on 18-of-21 while the Bulls only made 8-of-15.Despite questions on whether or not he would make his way back into the starting lineup, Brook Lopez eased those concerns in a big way, going 13-for-21 from the field to score a team-high of 29 points. It was a good sign for Lopez, as he's struggled to both get minutes and be productive ever since returning from injury. Joe Johnson was also a big factor. In 36 minutes he finished with 20 points (8-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and 11 rebounds. It was his first double-double of the year, setting a season-high for rebounds. Deron Williams continued to come off the bench. In 20 minutes he struggled to find his shot, going only 1-for-8 from the field and 0-for-1 from beyond the arc for six points. Jarrett Jack and Alan Anderson had 11 points each.For the first time in what feels like forever, Jimmy Butler seemingly struggled. He went only 3-for-12 from the field and 0-for-3 from the three-point line to score eight points. It was a season-low for Butler who's only failed to reach double figures in points one other time this season. Surprisingly, Mike Dunleavy was the Bulls highest score, as he finished with 23 points (9-15 FG, 5-9 3Pt) and five rebounds. He's averaging only 9.3 points on the year, so it was a nice surprise for the Bulls. Joakim Noah was able to record a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds, while Pau Gasol finished with 10 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Orlando Magic on Friday, while the Bulls will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Thursday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (23-8) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (19-14) 95-87 on Tuesday at Fed EX Forum Arena in Memphis.With the victory over the Spurs, the Grizzlies continue to make their case as one of the best teams in the Western Conference. Behind a strong first half, where Memphis out-scored San Antonio 52-38, the Grizzlies were able to coast to a victory in front of their home crowd. They also used a solid outing from the three-point line where they went 47 percent compared to the Spurs who went only 23 percent.Mike Conley was huge in this game and was the biggest reason the Grizzlies secured the victory. He went 10-for-13 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to finish with 30 points, while also adding seven rebounds and six assists. He's now combined for 54 points in his last two outings, as he's been dialed in with his shot. Marc Gasol also played well and came one rebound shy of a double-double. He finished with 17 points (6-12 FG, 5-7 FT), nine rebounds and five assists. While he didn't reach his season average of 20.1 points per game, it was still a very positive all-around effort. They only other player to reach double figures was Tayshaun Prince, who had 12 points (4-7 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) off the bench.The Spurs just didn't have their strongest offensive game in this one. With Tony Parker sitting out, Cory Joseph got the start at point guard and tied for a team-high of 18 points (9-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 0-1 FT). He's combined for 52 points over his last three outings, so he's done well lately. Marco Belinelli matched Joseph, going 7-for-13 from the field and 4-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in 35 minutes. It was one of his better games of the season, as he was averaging 9.8 points per game coming in. The only other player to reach double-figures was Patty Mills, who chipped in 10 points (3-10 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) off the bench.  The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers, while the Spurs will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday.

												The Pelicans improved to 16-15 on the season Tuesday night by knocking off the Suns by a score of 110-106. Anthony Davis was dominant yet again as he nearly posted a 20-20 performance. He ended up with 19 points on 7-of-15 shooting and added 18 rebounds to cement his fourth double-double in five games. The Suns (18-15) had their six-game winning streak snapped. They shot well from the floor with a 48 percent mark, but were out-rebounded by a count of 49-38. Phoenix has one more chance to end 2014 on a high note as they take on the Thunder in Oklahoma City on New Year's Eve. The Pelicans benefited from Davis' big night, but Tyreke Evans was key down the stretch for New Orleans. Evans had ten points in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory for the Pelicans. New Orleans also has a quick turnaround as they travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Wednesday night.

												The Mavericks (23-10) beat the Wizards (22-9) in blowout fashion Tuesday by a score of 114-87. In a game that featured one of the league's best offenses in the Mavericks pitted against one of the league's stingiest defenses in the Wizards, offense prevailed as Dallas led by 20 points for the majority of the second half. The Mavericks shot lights-out, hitting 52 percent from the floor and 53 percent from beyond the arc. Dallas had six players score in double figures, led by Monta Ellis with 20 points. Washington was coming off of a tight game Monday against the Rockets that came down to the final minute. That certainly didn't help their cause as the Wizards were out of contention for much of this game. Washington is an even 1-1 on their Western Conference road trip but will get two days off before taking the floor again Friday against the Thunder. Dallas has won three straight. They have the next two days off before starting a road trip that begins against the Boston Celtics on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (10-22) defeated the Denver Nuggets (13-19) 111-103 on Tuesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Behind a strong first half, where the Lakers out-scored the Nuggets 62-46, the Lakers were able to steal a victory on the road. They shot 53 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three-point line, while the Nuggets shot 45 percent from the floor and only 31 percent from beyond the arc. Despite turning the ball over 20 times, the Lakers' superior shooting kept them ahead.Kobe Bryant was the star Tuesday as usual, recording his first triple-double of the year with 23 points (6-11 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 8-11 FT), 11 rebounds and 11 assists. He nearly had the unconventional quadruple-double as well, considering he recorded nine turnovers. Bryant was basically able to do whatever he wanted against a poor Nuggets defense in this one. Coming off the bench, Carlos Boozer had a solid game. He scored 19 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 28 minutes. After recording only eight points on Sunday, it was a nice bounce back game for him. Starting at point guard, Ronnie Price had arguably his best game of the season. He went 6-for-10 from the field and 5-for-6 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 18 points. Considering he averages only five points a game, it was a nice boost for the Lakers. Wesley Johnson and Jordan Hill both reached double figures as well with 16 and 12 points respectively.As has been the case nearly all season, Ty Lawson did most of the damage offensively for the Nuggets. He went 5-for-11 from the floor and 5-for-9 from the free throw line to score 16 points, while also chipping in nine assists. It was about right on his season averages of 16.2 points and 10.3 assists per game. Coming off the bench Jusuf Nurkic had a surprising game, matching Lawson with 16 points (7-10 FG, 2-2 FT). He had only reached double figures in points twice this year, so the 16 points were a nice season-high for him. Despite having a poor showing from the three-point line, Nate Robinson was able to chip in 13 points (6-13 FG, 1-7 3Pt) off the bench. He played 22 minutes in this one, which was much more than usual, and was also able to capitalize with a season-high of six assists. Both Timofey Mozgov and Arron Afflalo had 11 points apiece.The Lakers' next game will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, while the Nuggets will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Thursday.

												Minnesota's woes continued Tueday when their losing streak was extended to nine games, falling to Utah by a score of 100-94. The Timberwolves let an eight-point lead with four minutes to go slip away as the Jazz scored 11 unanswered points to take control. In their Monday night loss to the Clippers, the Jazz's sub-par free throw shooting sunk them down the stretch, but they performed much better at the charity stripe Tuesday, burying 17 of their 22 free throws against the Timberwolves. Gordon Hayward had his third 20-point game in his last four contests. Against the Timberwolves, he led the Jazz with 26 points in 36 minutes. Despite losing their ninth straight game, Minnesota has to be encouraged by Shabazz Muhammad's night. Muhammad scored a season-high 30 points on 10-of-17 shooting from the floor, including five three-pointers. The Timberwolves are idle Wednesday before hosting the Kings on New Year's Day.The Jazz, coming off a tough loss Monday night at the Clippers, were able to rally in the fourth quarter against the Timberwolves. Utah has now won five of their last seven games, including wins at the Heat and at the Grizzlies. The Jazz will have the next two nights off before hosting the Hawks on Friday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Minnesota,Timberwolves,Vivint Smart Home Arena,5,25,11,21,7.0,19.0,38.0,79.0,17.0,22.0,43.0,16.0,13.0,8.0,17.0,38.0,82.0,10.0,14.0,34.0,26.0,10.0,Gordon Hayward,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,26.0,9.0,16.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,36,Shabazz Muhammad,7.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,30.0,10.0,17.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,38,Derrick Favors,8.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Thaddeus Young,4.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,31,Enes Kanter,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Gorgui Dieng,6.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,34,Rodney Hood,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,18,Andrew Wiggins,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,10.0,19.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,40,Trey Burke,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,10.0,21.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,36,Zach LaVine,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,25,Joe Ingles,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,24,Chase Budinger,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,16,Dante Exum,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,14,Anthony Bennett,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Rudy Gobert,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Mo Williams,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22,Patrick Christopher,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,12,Jeff Adrien,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Trevor Booker,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,23,Troy Daniels,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1

												The Portland Trail Blazers (26-7) defeated the Toronto Raptors (24-8) 102-97 on Tuesday at the Moda Center in Portland.At the end of the third quarter the Raptors had established a 70-63 lead, but the Blazers were able to come back and out-score the Raptors by seven, pushing the game to overtime. In overtime the Blazers were able to take control and finish off the victory in front of their home fans. Portland shot 33 percent from the three-point line, while Toronto shot only 18 percent, so that may have been the difference in this one.With LaMarcus Aldridge returning from an illness, he and Damian Lillard re-established their offensive duo. Lillard finished with 26 points (9-24 FG, 4-15 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and nine assists, nearly recording a double-double. Aldridge on the other hand shot really well, going 10-for-19 from the field to record 23 points, while also adding 13 rebounds. Despite missing games, he picked up right where he left off and scored at least 23 points for the sixth straight game. Wes Matthews continued to stay hot with his shot. He went 7-for-14 from the field and 5-for-10 from beyond the arc to score 19 points, while also adding six rebounds. Nicolas Batum and Chris Kaman were the other Blazers to reach double figures with 13 and 10 points respectively.With DeMar DeRozan sidelined, Kyle Lowry continued to pick up the slack. He finished the game with 25 points (10-26 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), seven rebounds and five assists, doing a little bit of everything for this team. Over his last three games, he's now averaging a ridiculous 28.5 points as the clear offensive leader. James Johnson, who's filling in for DeRozan, had a decent game as well. He scored an efficient 14 points (7-11 FG) and grabbed 11 rebounds, giving him his first double-double of the season. Greivis Vasquez was the biggest contributor off the bench.

												The Golden State Warriors (25-5) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (4-26) 126-86 on Tuesday.Golden State has won two straight, and Marreese Speights was the man to carry them Tuesday. He scored a game-high 23 points in just 24 minutes in the blowout as both teams extended their bench rotations once the game got out of hand. The Warriors shot 56 percent from the field and 43 percent from beyond the arc, decimating a Sixers defense that has found it's way of late and that shouldn't be looked at as an easy puzzle to crack. Golden State will have a couple days off before hosting the Toronto Raptors on Friday.Philadelphia has lost three straight as they wade through the middle of a seven-game road trip that started in Orlando on Dec. 21. The Sixers gave up a gut-wrenching 43 easy ponts off of 28 turnovers, and even when they did get a shot up, they weren't falling. Philadelphia shot 38 percent from the field and 30 percent from beyond the arc, with starting point guard Michael Carter-Williams shooting just 1-for-7 from the field and contributing little else despite playing 38 minutes. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute (calf) and Hollis Thompson (illness) sat out the game. Nerlens Noel was questionable coming into the contest with a sprained ankle, but he was able to give it a go and put up eight points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes. Philadelphia will travel to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Friday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (16-16) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (10-22) 104-94 on Monday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.After taking a big lead into halftime and then letting the Hornets make a comeback leading to this overtime thriller, the Bucks were able to save themselves in the extra period and out-scored the Hornets 21-11 to seal the victory on the road. The Bucks as a whole shot much better than the Hornets, going 47 percent from the field, while New Orleans went just 37 percent from the floor. This win puts the Bucks winning percentage back at .500 on the season. The Bucks had six players reach double figures, with three of them coming off the bench. Brandon Knight led all scorers for the Bucks, finishing with 18 points (8-19 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and four assists. Despite a solid showing offensively, he did record a season-high of eight turnovers, so it wasn't all good for the guard. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the other big contributor in the starting lineup. He was very efficient in this game, going 7-for-8 from the field and 2-for-3 from the free throw line to finish with 16 points, while also adding eight rebounds. He's struggled over the Bucks' last two games, combining for only 12 points, so it was good to see him get back on track. The biggest bench contributor was Jared Dudley, who came one rebound shy of a double-double. He posted 17 points (5-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and nine rebounds in the victory. Most of the production for the Hornets came from the duo of Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker. Walker had a game-high of 28 points (7-22 FG, 2-8 3Pt), while adding an uncharacteristic four blocked shots. A huge portion of his points came from the free throw line, where he made 12-of-13 attempts. Henderson on the other hand shot well, going 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 19 points. He's combined for only nine points over the last two games, so this marked a bounce back game for the shooting guard. The only other Hornet to reach double figures in points was Michael Kidd-Gilchrist who finished with 10 points (5-10 FG). With Al Jefferson having a tough night from the field (3-12 FG) and leaving the game in the fourth quarter with a groin strain, it figured to limit the Hornets overall success.    The Bucks' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, while the Hornets will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Wednesday.

All Chicago starters had a positive or neutral plus/minus, while all of their bench players had a negative plus/minus. The exact opposite was true for the Pacers, whose starters all had a negative plus/minus, and their bench players all finished with a positive plus/minus.Chicago was lead Jimmy Butler with 27 points (8-20 FG), nine rebounds and four steals in 44 minutes of play. Derrick Rose shot just 5-of-20 from the field, finishing with 17 points, six assists and two blocks.

												Despite big performances from DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay, the Kings were unable to overcome a rash of turnovers as they fell to the Brooklyn Nets by a score of 107-99 on Monday.The Nets benefitted from the Kings' turnover troubles, scoring 25 points off of 21 turnovers. Brooklyn scored 11 unanswered points to secure a 13-point lead at the half. The Kings cut the lead to six points late in the fourth, but were unable to close the gap down the stretch.Cousins posted the third double-double of his last four games. Gay scored a game-high 25 points, giving him back-to-back games with over 20 points. The Kings will travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday.The Nets enjoyed a big performance from Mason Plumlee, who scored a team-high 22 points in 33 minutes and added four rebounds. Brook Lopez and Deron Williams played 12 and 17 minutes off the bench respectively. Lopez finished with 11 points and six rebounds, a modest line that is signigicant only because he failed to score in double figures in his three previous games since returning from injury. The Nets will travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Tuesday. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Sacramento,Kings,Barclays Center,13,18,14,16,8.0,21.0,36.0,80.0,27.0,39.0,40.0,20.0,9.0,9.0,20.0,34.0,73.0,16.0,20.0,42.0,22.0,20.0,Joe Johnson,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,33,Rudy Gay,9.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,21.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,37,Kevin Garnett,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Jason Thompson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Mason Plumlee,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,22.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,DeMarcus Cousins,13.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,24.0,9.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,36,Sergey Karasev,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,30,Ben McLemore,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,31,Jarrett Jack,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,31,Darren Collison,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,30,Mirza Teletovic,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,29,Derrick Williams,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8,Alan Anderson,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,25,Ray McCallum,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,17,Deron Williams,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,16,Reggie Evans,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,7,Brook Lopez,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Nik Stauskas,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,16,Bojan Bogdanovic,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6,Omri Casspi,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20

												The Orlando Magic (13-21) defeated the Miami Heat (14-18) 102-101 on Monday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.Tied 77-77 going into the fourth quarter, this game was destined to be a close finish. In the final moments of the game, Victor Oladipo was fouled and hit 1-of-2 free throws to give the Magic the one-point lead. That ended up being the game winner, as Dwyane Wade couldn't connect on a last second heave with under a second left on the clock. The Heat have now lost two in a row and six of their last ten. The Magic's starters did most of the damage in this one. Leading all scorers, Nikola Vucevic converted on 12-of-17 shots from the field to finish with 26 points, while also adding nine rebounds. He's had a lot of success over his last two outings, averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds over those two games. He's now at 18.1 points and 11.6 rebounds per game this year. Victor Oladipo was also one of the main contributors, as he went 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 22 points. Considering he's averaging 14.1 points thus far on the season, it was a nice surprise for the Magic to get this kind of production. Staying extremely consistent so far this season, Tobias Harris didn't dissapoint. He finished with 18 points (8-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt), which was right on par with his season average of 18.6 points per game. The Heat were led by Dwyane Wade in this one. He scored 25 points (7-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and handed out six assists, while getting a good portion of his offensive output at the free throw line, where he went a perfect 11-for-11. In very impressive fashion, Wade is now averaging 28.9 points over his last seven outings. Chirs Bosh also had a solid game. He scored 20 points (8-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-7 FT) and grabbed eight rebounds in 32 minutes. He's now averaging 21.5 points and 8.2 rebounds on the year. Coming off the bench, Danny Granger had his second straight impressive game. In arguably his best performance of the season so far, Granger went 7-for-10 from the field and a ridiculous 6-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 21 points. The Heat signed him in the offseason hoping for this type of production, so they'll be hoping he can finally gain some consistency and keep it up.  The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, while the Magic will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday.

												The Washington Wizards (22-8) defeated the Houston Rockets (21-9) 104-103 on Monday at the Toyota Center in Houston.Despite out-scoring the Wizards 36-26, marked by a big late quarter run, the Rockets just ran out of time and weren't able to complete the comeback to get the victory in front of their home fans. Free throws may have been the difference in this one, with the Wizards converting on 26-of-28, while the Rockets only hit 14-of-23 from the line. The Wizards victory was largely the result of an outstanding performance from Bradley Beal. Beal went 9-for-17 from the field and 5-for-11 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 33 points. He was able to get to the line at will, converting on a perfect 10-of-10 on his free throws. It was a nice breakout performance for him, as he's averaged 14.9 points thus far this season. Another solid contributor was Paul Pierce who had an efficient 21 points, where he went 7-for-9 from the floor and 6-for-6 from the free throw line. He's bumped up his scoring the last few games, combining for 38 points over that span. John Wall didn't have his best shooting performance (4-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt), but he still finished with 13 points and was able to add 12 assists, giving him a double-double. The Wizards' bench had only 16 points in the win.Continuing to perform with MVP-like numbers, James Harden again had a strong showing. He matched a game-high with 33 points, while also contributing six rebounds and four assists. He's been unstoppable the past two weeks, as he's averaging an incredible 34.3 points per game over his last four outings. Providing Harden some help was Trevor Ariza, who scored 15 points (6-15 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and recorded five rebounds. After a poor showing on Sunday, it was good to see him turn things around. Also, in his second impressive performance in a row, Corey Brewer came off the bench for 15 points (5-13 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and two steals. Although he didn't reach the 25-point mark like he did Sunday, he continued to be a nice spark off the bench since being aquired a little over a week ago from the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, while the Rockets will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday.

												In a close contest, the Clippers held off the Utah Jazz 101-97. The Jazz had a chance to cut the Clippers' lead to one point late in the game, but Derrick Favors missed two free throws to keep the score at 99-96 with 31 seconds remaining in the fourth.Free throws played a huge role late in this game. The Jazz shot a paltry 59.1 percent from the line as a team and missed several free throws late in the game. Favors, who was shooting 69.5 percent from the line coming into the game, was 3-for-9 from the charity stripe Tuesday night. By comparison, the Clippers were 17-for-22 from the line in this matchup. Still, the Jazz kept the game very close, as they never trailed by more than five points in the fourth quarter.The Jazz (10-21) had won four out of five games coming into Tuesday night's matchup and gave the Clippers quite a scare at the Staples Center. Gordon Hayward led the Jazz in scoring with 22 points and added seven rebounds as well. The Jazz also got a solid performance off the bench by second-year big man Rudy Gobert, who posted a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds.The Jazz have a quick turnaround as they return home to play Minnesota on Tuesday night.The Clippers (21-11) were led by a big performance from Blake Griffin, who had 24 points, six rebounds, seven assists, and three blocks. Spencer Hawes played 13 minutes in his return after missing the previous nine games with a knee injury. The Clippers are now 2-1 in the first three games of their nine-game homestand. They are idle Tuesday before taking on the Knicks on New Year's Eve.

												The Pistons (7-23) knocked off the Cavaliers (18-12) 103-80 in Cleveland on Sunday.The Cavaliers jumped out to a 28-17 lead after the first quarter but went cold from the field and were outscored 33-19 in the second period. The Cavs’ struggles continued in the second half, as they were outscored by 13 in the third quarter and managed only 19 points in the fourth. LeBron James scored 17 points to go with 10 rebounds, but he shot just 5-of-19 from the field. Kevin Love added 20 points and 10 rebounds, while Tristan Thompson added 18 points and 11 rebounds. Matthew Dellavedova, starting in place of Kyrie Irving, finished with just three points in 26 minutes. The Cavaliers shot 38 percent as a team and converted just 5-of-29 three-point attempts.Detroit, meanwhile, shot 45 percent from the floor and knocked down 17 three-pointers. Brandon Jennings led the way with 25 points and six assists, and Andre Drummond added 16 points and 17 rebounds. Greg Monroe shot 4-of-18 from the field, finishing with 10 points and six rebounds.

												The San Antonio Spurs (19-13) defeated the Houston Rockets (21-8) 110-106 on Sunday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.Both teams put up nearly identical shooting numbers in this matchup. The Spurs went 47 percent from the field and 37 percent from the three-point line, while the Rockets shot 49 percent from the floor and 36 percent from beyond the arc. The difference in this game came down to turnovers, as the Spurs defense was able to force the Rockets into a season-high of 25. It gave them enough of an advantage to seal the victory.The Spurs were led by Danny Green, who had a team-high of 24 points (6-13 FG, 3-9 3Pt), while also recording five steals. He got to the free throw line 10 times, and converted on nine of those attempts. The five steals were a season-high, and the points were well above his season average of 12.5 points per game. With Tony Parker sitting out, Cory Joseph took his spot in the starting lineup as the point guard. He shot well, going 6-for-9 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 14 points in 34 minutes. He also had six rebounds and four assists. But without Parker, the Spurs also leaned on their other veterans with both Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili getting plenty of touches. Duncan finished with 16 points (6-12 FG, 4-5 FT) and eight rebounds, while Ginobili came off the bench to score 15 points (5-7 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and four assists. It was a nice win for the Spurs over a quality opponent.Despite taking the loss, the Rockets had a few players that played well. James Harden led the Rockets, going 10-for-18 from the floor and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 28 points. He also added five assists, but uncharacteristically turned the ball over nine times, which was the most he's had all season. He was a big reason for the team turnover difference that really hurt the Rockets. Coming off the bench, Corey Brewer came out firing. He went 8-for-11 from the field and 6-for-8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points. It was a season-high for Brewer, as he seemingly couldn't miss for the majority of the game. The other big contribution came from Dwight Howard who had a monster line of 24 points (11-13 FG, 2-7 FT) and 17 rebounds. After scoring only six points on Friday against the Grizzlies, it was nice bounce back game for Howard.  The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday, while the Rockets will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Monday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (22-10) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (15-17) 112-107 on Sunday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.Despite the loss, the Thunder shot much better than the Mavericks as they finished 50 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, while the Mavericks shot 44 percent from the floor and 32 percent from beyond the arc. The Thunder also severely out-rebounded the Mavericks 53-37, but it still wasn't enough to push them to the victory. What may have been the difference is free throws, as the Thunder made only 12-of-21 from the line.The Mavericks were led by the duo of Dirk Nowitzki and Chandler Parson. Nowitzki shot 8-for-13 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 30 points, while also adding five rebounds. He was able to get to the free throw line 12 times and converted on a perfect 12 of those attempts. With Tyson Chandler sitting out, Nowitzki started at center instead of power forward, but it only helped him in the end as the 30 points matched a season-high for him. Parsons on the other hand shot 10-for-16 from the field and 5-for-9 from beyond the arc to score 26 points. After not doing much offensively over his last three games, it was good to see Parsons get back on track. Both Rajon Rondo and Monta Ellis also played well. Rondo had 15 points (7-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and seven assists, while Ellis had 18 points (6-20 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and five assists.With Kevin Durant still sitting out, Russell Westbrook continued to take the bulk of the shots. Despite getting off so many shots, Westbrook shot only 6-for-23 from the field, but still scored 18 points, as he converted on 6-of-9 attempts from the free throw line. He nearly recorded a triple-double, as he finished with nine rebounds and nine assists, while even adding five steals. The player who had the biggest night though was Serge Ibaka, who has been somehwat quiet this season. He had an efficient 26 points (11-14 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 10 rebounds in 37 minutes. The double-double was his second in a row and seventh on the season. Leading the bench in scoring, Reggie Jackson finished with 21 points (10-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt), but turned the ball over six times, which may have taken away from an otherwise solid performance.The Mavericks' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (25-7) defeated the New York Knicks (5-28) 101-79 on Sunday.Portland has won three straight games. Wesley Matthews scored a game-high 28 points to pace the Trail Blazers. Not needed for much in the blowout, Damian Lillard scored 11 points and handed out six assists. LaMarcus Aldridge sat out a second straight game with an illness, but Chris Kaman, whom was away from the team for a personal reason for their last game, was able to return. Kaman put up 13 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. Third-year center Joel Freeland put up the first double-double of his career, posting 10 points and 10 rebounds in 25 minutes. The Trail Blazers will stay home to host the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday.New York has lost eight straight games. The Trail Blazers held them to 33 percent shooting from the field and 26 percent from beyond the arc. Carmelo Anthony played through his knee soreness, but with the game out of hand at the half, the Knicks opted to start Travis Wear in his place for the start of the third quarter and hold Anthony out. Amar'e Stoudemire (knee), Samuel Dalembert (ankle) and J.R. Smith missed the game with their assorted injuries, but despite all of the negative injuries the Knicks are dealing with, Cole Aldrich has used the opportunity to shine. He put up 12 points and 19 rebounds in 34 minutes Sunday for a double-double, and he has now strung together four consecutive nice performances in a row. While Aldrich's success is likely just the result of a mediocre player getting more minutes on a struggling team, pulling down 19 rebounds is impressive in any context. The Knicks will wrap up their road trip against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Toronto Raptors (24-7) defeated the Denver Nuggets (13-18) 116-102 on Sunday.Toronto has won two straight and eight of their last nine games. Louis Williams paced the team with a game-high 31 points in 34 minutes off the bench. The Nuggets' small lineups allowed the Raptors to go small as well, which resulted in starting center Jonas Valanciunas playing just 17 minutes. To back up Williams' big night, Kyle Lowry put up a double-double of 30 points and 11 assists in 38 minutes. The Raptors will continue their road trip against the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday.Denver has lost three of their last four games and have dropped to 12th place in the Western Conference standings, three games behind the Phoenix Suns for the final playoff spot. Ty Lawson led the way with a team-high 28 points and seven assists, while Wilson Chandler and Kenneth Faried posted impressive double-doubles. Chandler had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Faried posted 17 points and 19 rebounds. Returning from a five-game absence, Darrell Arthur posted two points and two rebounds in 11 minutes off the bench. The Nuggets will try to right the course when they host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.

												The Phoenix Suns (18-14) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (9-22) 116-107 on Sunday. Phoenix has won six straight and are determined to stay in competition for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. Goran Dragic scored a game-high 24 points, but Eric Bledsoe led the way with his all-around production of 22 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and four blocks in 32 minutes. The Suns shot 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the line, while also out-rebounding the Lakers 45-35. Phoenix will continue their road trip against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday.Turnovers were brutal on both sides of the court. The Suns gave up 18 points on 12 turnovers, while the Lakers gave up 25 points on 17 turnovers.Los Angeles has lost three straight, but the silver lining from Sunday's game was getting Kobe Bryant back in the lineup after he sat out the last three games to rest his sore body. Bryant put up a Rajon Rondo-esque line of 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in 32 minutes on 4-of-10 shooting from the floor. Despite their trouble rebounding and holding on to the ball, the Lakers performed well shooting the ball, converting 52 percent of their shots from the field and 60 percent of their shots from beyond the arc. Nick Young scored a team-high 21 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Los Angeles will go on the road to take on the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday.

												The Toronto Raptors (23-7) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (20-11) 110-98 on Saturday.Toronto has won seven of their last eight games. Kyle Lowry continues to carry the weight for the Raptors with DeMar DeRozan (adductor) still sidelined. Lowry posted a game-high 25 points to go with seven assists and three steals. Jonas Valanciunas helped him with 22 points of his own, for his second consecutive 20-point game. Landry Fields (concussion) missed his third straight game, but he appears close to returning, and DeRozan is travelling with the team on their road trip which could mean he is nearing a return.Los Angeles has lost three of their last four as they hit one of the tougher bumps in their schedule. DeAndre Jordan worked the glass for his third 20-plus rebound game in the last two weeks. The Clippers gave up 20 easy points on 14 turnovers, pointing to their greatest weakness Saturday and the primary reason for their loss. Spencer Hawes missed his ninth straight game with a bone bruise in his knee, and while some reports suggest he's close to returning, if George Hill's bone bruise in his knee was any clue, Hawes could miss considerably more time. Hill, of the Indiana Pacers, missed nearly two months with the injury after initially being projected to only miss about three weeks.

												The Orlando Magic (12-21) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (10-21) 102-94 on Saturday. Orlando has won two of their last three games as they continue to experiment with their latest starting lineup that includes Elfrid Payton at point guard and Kyle O'Quinn at power forward. O'Quinn had his second straight game playing reduced minutes. After foul trouble held him to just 16 minutes Friday, he played just 14 minutes Saturday, though it appears his limited minutes Saturday were simply due to the Magic's rotation and matchups against the Hornets. Payton approached a triple-double, putting up 11 points, seven rebounds and eight assists in 35 minutes. The Magic will wrap up their two-game road trip against the Miami Heat on Monday.Charlotte has dropped two straight as they try not to falter too much following their promising four-game win streak. Kemba Walker put the team on his back to try to get the win. He put up a career-high 42 points in 42 minutes, shooting 15-of-31 from the field. The rest of the roster wasn't much help. They shot 42 percent from the field and gave up 18 points off turnovers. Lance Stephenson remains out with a groin injury, but considering all the trade rumors going around about Stephenson, the Hornets probably aren't too worried about his absence. Charlotte will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday.

												The Washington Wizards (21-8) defeated the Boston Celtics (10-18) 101-88 on Saturday.Washington is on a two-game win streak. They jumped out to a 30-12 lead after the first quarter and held the Celtics at a distance the rest of the game. The Wizards shot 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from beyond the arc. Andre Miller finished with seven assists in 18 minutes off the bench, earning a few extra minutes of run with the game in hand. Washington will embark on a five-game Western Conference road trip that begins against the Houston Rockets on Monday. Boston has lost four straight games as their commitment to rebuilding following the trade of Rajon Rondo to the Dallas Mavericks has them on a downward spiral. Marcus Smart made a second straight start at point guard, but he played just 14 minutes. The Celtics were beat in several ways. They shot just 41 percent from the field, lost the rebound battle 48-36 and gave up 22 points on 18 turnovers. They will return home and have three days off before hosting the Sacramento Kings on Wendesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (22-8) defeated the Miami Heat (14-17) 103-95 on Saturday.Memphis ended their four-game losing streak with the win. Zach Randolph (knee) was still out, but the Grizzlies used their depth to get out to a comfortable lead early. Six players scored in double figures with Mike Conley scoring a team-high 24 points. Memphis won the game at the foul line, going to the charity stripe 37 times to convert 28 of their free points. The Grizzlies will return home to host the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday.Miami has lost four of their last six games as they struggle to overcome the absence of Chris Bosh. Bosh has missed the last eight games with a calf strain. He was targeting a return for this game but was not ready to go. Shawne Williams was limited by a foot injury but was able to tough out 17 minutes. Dwyane Wade paced the team with a game-high 25 points and seven assists, but his great play on offense hasn't been able to carry the Heat as much as it once did. Miami will host the Orlando Magic on Monday.

												The Chicago Bulls (21-9) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (15-15) 107-100 on Saturday.Chicago is on a six-game winning streak. Jimmy Butler led the way with a game-high 33 points Saturday, doing the dirty work to get to the free-throw line for 10 attempts to convert nine free points. The Bulls spread out the responsibilities, using a deep rotation that saw Taj Gibson collect a double-double of 12 points and 10 rebounds and Aaron Brooks post 13 points and four assists off the bench. Kirk Hinrich sat out a third straight game with a hamstring injury. Chicago will go on the road to play the Indiana Pacers on Monday.New Orleans has lost two of their last three games. Anthony Davis put up 29 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks playing in front of his hometown crowd Saturday, and Tyreke Evans pitched in 26 points, five rebound and five assists, but the Pelicans' good performances from Davis and Evans weren't enough to overcome the poor play from several of their role players. They gave up 23 points on 15 turnovers, essentially giving the game away. New Orleans will host the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

												The Indiana Pacers (11-20) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (13-16) 110-85 on Saturday. Indiana has won three of their last four games, and the return of George Hill to the active roster three games ago has given them reason to be optimistic. The Pacers brought Hill off the bench for his first two games but moved him into the starting lineup at point guard Saturday. He finished with 12 points, six rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes. Seven players scored in double figures for Indiana, with Rodney Stuckey scoring a team-high 20 points. The Pacers will try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Chicago Bulls on Monday.Brooklyn had their three-game win streak come to an end with the loss. Jarrett Jack started a second straight game with Deron Williams coming off the bench, and Brook Lopez came off the bench for a third straight game behind Mason Plumlee as coach Lionel Hollins continues to play the guys he thinks are getting the job done instead of just lining up his five most expensive contracts against other teams.

												The Atlanta Hawks (22-8) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (15-16) 90-85 on Saturday. Playing on the second night of a home-and-home back-to-back between these two teams, the Hawks came into Saturday's game looking for revenge after they took a beating at the hands of the Bucks 107-77 on Friday, and they got their revenge. Atlanta jumped out to a 21-10 lead after the first quarter. They gave up most of their lead in the second quarter but had enough to hang on for the win. Jeff Teague paced the team with a game-high 25 points in 37 minutes, indicating that he is probably over his hamstring injury. The Hawks shot a putrid 37 percent from the field but were able to secure the win by holding the Bucks to an unremarkable 39 percent shooting from the field and by getting 32 easy points on 19 turnovers by the Bucks.  Milwaukee was playing without Ersan Ilyasova (concussion) and Larry Sanders (illness), leaving them inadequately supplied to deal with the strength and skill of Al Horford and Paul Millsap. Khris Middleton found success off the bench, putting up a team-high 21 points in 37 minutes. The Bucks will continue their road trip against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday.

												The Utah Jazz (10-20) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (4-25) 88-71 on Saturday. Utah has won four of their last five games. They shot a horrible 36 percent from the field and 17 percent from beyond the arc but were able to overcome the Sixers by holding them to an even more deplorable 32 percent shooting from the field and 19 percent from beyond the arc. Derrick Favors led the way for the Jazz with 17 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks, doing his best Anthony Davis impression to help secure the win. Trevor Booker returned to the lineup after sitting out their last game. He put up 14 points and five rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. Utah will go on the road to play the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.Philadelphia has lost two straight, but they continue to play well defensively. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute sat out the game with a calf strain, giving Henry Sims an opportunity to crawl back into the starting lineup. Sims put up 10 points and eight rebounds in 32 minutes. JaKarr Sampson started the game at shooting guard in place of Hollis Thompson (illness), but Sampson was replaced in the starting lineup by Tony Wroten to begin the second half. Wroten finished with 20 points and six rebounds in 32 minutes. The Sixers will continue their road trip against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday.

												The Sacramento Kings (13-17) defeated the New York Knicks (5-27) 135-129 in overtime on Saturday. Sacramento stopped their two-game losing streak with the win. DeMarcus Cousins sat out their loss to the Phoenix Suns on Friday with flu symptoms, but he was able to return Saturday and led the team with a game-high 39 points to go with 11 rebounds and four assists in 32 minutes. Rudy Gay and Darren Collison got in on the fun as well. Gay finished with 29 points, while Collison posted a double-double of 27 points and 10 assists. The Kings couldn't be stopped on offense, shooting 55 percent from the field, 50 percent from beyond the arc and 88 percent from the foul line. Sacramento will try to keep the good times rolling when they embark on a four-game road trip that begins against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday.New York has lost seven straight games, and the immediate future looks bleak for them. Carmelo Anthony continues to play through knee soreness, putting up 36 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in 46 minutes, playing like a man in his prime. Amar'e Stoudemire sat out, resting for the third time in their last four games. Cole Aldrich and Jason Smith were the soup du jour in the frontcourt for the Knicks. Both performed adequately. New York has two more games on their Western Conference road trip. They'll take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.

												The Golden State Warriors (24-5) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-24) 110-97 on Saturday.Golden State stopped their two-game skid with the win. Stephen Curry led the way with a game-high 25 points, and Klay Thompson splashed 21 points into the pool as well. Marreese Speights stayed in the starting lineup at center with Festus Ezeli (ankle) and Andrew Bogut (knee) out indefinitely. Speights finished with 10 points and six rebounds in 19 minutes. The Warriors will host the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday for what will likely be a second straight win.Minnesota has lost eight straight games. They're committed to their youth movement, as they continue to start Zach LaVine at point guard, giving him every opportunity to develop early in his rookie season. He showed up well Saturday, putting up a double-double of 12 points and 14 assists in 31 minutes. Thaddeus Young led the Timberwolves with a team-high 17 points, but the team's struggles shooting the ball (44 percent) and the fact that they gave up 36 easy points on 24 turnovers points to the two most obvious reasons why they couldn't keep up with the Warriors. Minnesota will wrap up their road trip against the Utah Jazz on Tuesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (13-15) defeated the Boston Celtics (10-17) 109-107 on Friday.Brooklyn extended their win streak to three games with Friday’s win, their longest streak of the season. Deron Williams returned from a two-game absence with a calf injury to come off the bench and score eight points with four assists in 21 minutes. Jarrett Jack, who started in Williams' place, carried this game to make an argument for bigger minutes going forward, finishing with 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 34 minutes. The win further separated the eighth place Nets from ninth place Celtics as the Nets continue to position themselves for the playoffs as the team gets healthy. Brooklyn will return to the court Saturday to play the Pacers at home.Boston is heading in the opposite direction from the Nets as Friday’s loss made it three in a row for the Celtics. Despite starting off the third quarter strong, Boston was unable to stop a second half push by Brooklyn to get back in the game. Compared to the previous two losses, the Celtics got solid all-around production from their starters.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (15-16) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (10-20) 98-75 on Friday.Oklahoma City has won two straight but just three of their last six games. Kevin Durant missed his fifth straight game, but he did participate in portions of Friday's shootaround, meaning he could be nearing a return from his sprained ankle. Russell Westbrook continues to step up in Durant's absence. Westbrook put up 29 points and five assists in just 25 minutes Friday. Steven Adams has been doing great work on the boards of late. He pulled down nine Friday, and in the four games leading into the contest, he had recorded double-digit rebounds in each game. The Thunder will go on the road to face the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday.Charlotte saw their four-game win streak come to an end with the loss. Lance Stephenson sat out a fifth straight game. The Hornets shot a woeful 29 percent from the field and 21 percent from beyond the arc. They lost the first three quarters of the game, thoroughly taking their drubbing from the Thunder. Kemba Walker had been on a tear of late, but he finished with just nine six points and two assists in 30 minutes as the Hornets turned to their bench players for much of the second half with the game out of reach. Charlotte will return home to host the Orlando Magic on Saturday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (18-11) defeated the Orlando Magic (11-21) 98-89 on Friday at the Amway Center in Orlando.Despite suffering the nine-point loss, the Magic took the upper hand in shooting percentages. The Magic shot 49 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line, while the Cavaliers went 41 percent from the field and only 27 percent from the three-point line. Although they finished with the superior shooting percentage, the Magic were forced into 17 turnovers, which ultimately may have been the difference in this one.The Cavaliers were led by LeBron James, who despite going 0-for-5 from the three-point line, was able to convert 10-for-20 from the field to score 29 points, while also contributing eight assists. In his last two outings, he's combined for 59 points and 16 assists, as he's been the Cavaliers' offensive focal point. Kevin Love also played a big part in this victory. He finished with 22 points (7-17 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and seven rebounds. He's now averaging 16.8 points and 10.3 rebounds on the year and was needed for scoring with Kyrie Irving sitting out. The only other player to reach double figures in points was Dion Waiters. Coming off the bench, he was able to score 17 points (6-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-5 FT). It was a nice bounce back game for him offensively, after scoring only eight points in 28 minutes on Thursday against the Miami Heat.The Magic on the other hand were led by the duo of Tobias Harris and Evan Fournier. Harris went 7-for-16 from the floor and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while Fournier went 5-for-10 from the field and 2-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 15 points off the bench. It was a nice turn around game for Fournier, who shot only 22.2 percent (2-9 FG) against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday. Victor Oladipo also had a solid contribution. He finished with 13 points (5-14 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT), four rebounds and eight assists in 36 minutes. Like Fournier, Oladipo really struggled against the Celtics on Tuesday, shooting 13 percent (2-15 FG) from the floor, so it was again good to see a bounce back game from him. Ben Gordon had 10 points off the bench as well.The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, while the Magic will travel to Charlotte to play the HOrnets on Saturday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (15-15) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (21-8) 107-77 on Friday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.The Bucks shot very well in this one, going 51 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line. They were able to use a strong defensive presence in the second half to hold the Hawks to only 16 in the third quarter and 19 in the fourth. The Bucks were also able to force the Hawks into 23 turnovers, even furthering their advantage in a 30-point blow out win.The Bucks' bench played a key role in this one, with Jared Dudley ending as the star of the game. Dudley came off the bench and went a perfect 10-for-10 from the field and 4-for-4 from beyond the arc to score 24 points. Averaging only 6.1 points per game so far this season, it was a nice surprise for the Bucks, as the Hawks couldn't find anyone who could slow him down from on the defensive side of the ball. Brandon Knight also continued with his strong play. He finished the game with 16 points (5-11 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and five rebounds. Knight is now averaging 25 points in his last two outings, as he's really found his shooting stroke lately. Getting the start at center with Larry Sanders sitting out, Zaza Puchulia posted an efficient 14 points (6-9 FG, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds in 26 minutes. The 14 points matched a season-high for him.Despite not playing the toughest defense, the Hawks also struggled offensively. After contributuing solid numbers all year, DeMarre Carroll and Kyle Korver really struggled in this one. They went a combined 1-for-14 from the field and 1-for-10 from the three-point line to score three points. Paul Millsap had the most success out of anyone. He finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds, marking his seventh double-double of the year. The only other Hawks to reach double figures in points were Al Horford and Jeff Teague, who scored 13 and 12 points respectively.The Bucks and Hawks will square off again on Saturday in their second of back-to-back games.

												The Detroit Pistons (6-23) defeated the Indiana Pacers (10-20) 119-109 on Friday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.Collectively as a team, the Pistons shot extremely well tonight, going 55 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line. They were able to put in a big third quarter, where they out-scored the Pacers 36-29, which set them up to secure a 10-point victory in front of their home fans. The Pistons also forced the Pacers into 18 turnovers, while having only 11 of their own.The Pistons had a total team-effort victory Friday, as seven players reached double-figures in points. Andre Drummond led all scorers, posting an effecient 20 points (9-12 FG, 2-8 FT) and six rebounds. It was the first time in seven games that he failed to reach double-digit rebounds, but took care of business on the offensive side of the ball to be a big factor in the victory. Greg Monroe also was effecient, going 7-for-11 from the field and 5-for-8 from the free throw line to score 19 points. He was able to pull in 15 rebounds, marking his ninth double-double of the season. He's now averaging 14.8 points and 9.1 rebounds on the year. Brandon Jennings posted a double-double of his own with 14 points (6-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt) and 10 assists. It was his third double-double of the year. The bench was very productive as well, with DJ Augustin and Jodie Meeks scoring 14 and 13 points respectively.For the Pacers, most of the offensive damage was done by Roy Hibbert who scored 19 points and grabbed five rebounds before fouling out after playing in 22 minutes. He was able to get to the free throw line at will, converting on 9-of-10 free throw attempts. CJ Watson was another bright spot for the Pacers. He shot 6-for-8 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 14 points, while also handing out six assists. He's now averaging 11.1 points and 4.4 assists on the season. The other starter to reach double figures in points was Solomon Hill, who scored 14 points (4-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-5 FT) in 37 minutes.

												The Houston Rockets (21-7) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (21-8) 117-111 on Friday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.In a meeting of Southwest Division foes, the Rockets were able to push past the Grizzlies in a tough overtime victory and move to the top of their division standings. Despite turning the ball over 14 times, the Rockets used a 54-44 rebounding advantage to secure the victory on the road. They also shot well from the floor, going 45 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line.Continuing to build on a potential MVP season, James Harden again looked the part Friday. He went 10-for-17 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 32 points, while also nearing a triple-double with eight rebounds and 10 assists as well. Without anyone who could stop him, Harden was able to get to the free throw line over and over again, finishing the game 10-for-11 from the line. Harden has gone on a tear the last two games, combining for 76 points, 11 rebounds and 17 assists over that span. In his first game with the Rockets after signing only a day before, Josh Smith had a very successful debut, scoring 21 points (9-21 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and grabbing eight rebounds. Although joining a crowded frontcourt, he still got off plenty of shots. Trevor Ariza also played well and recorded his second double-double of the season with 15 points and 10 rebounds.Despite the loss, Marc Gasol continued to have a fantastic season. He was able to shoot over 50 percent, going 12-for-21 from the floor and 1-for-1 from beyond the arc to score 29 points, while also grabbing eight rebounds. He's now recorded at least 23 points in five of his last six games, as he's one of the hottest centers offensively in the league at this moment. Coming off the bench, Beno Udrih also did everything he could to keep the Grizzlies in the game. In only 20 minutes he went 7-for-12 from the field to score 17 points. The 17 points were a season-high for him, as he's only averaged 7.2 points per game up until this point. Also coming off the bench were Quincy Pondexter and Vince Carter who scored 14 and 10 points respectively.The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday, while the Grizzlies will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Saturday. 											",New Orleans,Pelicans,San Antonio,Spurs,Smoothie King Center,18,13,15,14,6.0,17.0,35.0,84.0,21.0,24.0,43.0,25.0,8.0,6.0,14.0,37.0,74.0,10.0,14.0,39.0,25.0,17.0,Luke Babbitt,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Kyle Anderson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,Anthony Davis,12.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,22.0,8.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,37,Tim Duncan,11.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,20.0,8.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,34,Omer Asik,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Tiago Splitter,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Tyreke Evans,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,30,Danny Green,6.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,36,Jrue Holiday,5.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,34,Cory Joseph,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,8.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,38,Austin Rivers,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,29,Marco Belinelli,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,32,Ryan Anderson,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,15.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,32,Manu Ginobili,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,26,Dante Cunningham,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Boris Diaw,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Alexis Ajinca,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Aron Baynes,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,John Salmons,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,18,Matt Bonner,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7

												The New Orleans Pelicans (15-14) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (18-13) 97-90 on Friday.New Orleans has won four of their last six. While they are currently fighting for one of the last playoff spots in the Western Conference, the Pelicans are still finding out how to win every night. They have the talent to beat the best teams in the West, but the Pelicans lack the experience and chemistry to play as consistently from game to game as the top eight teams in the conference. Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson both put up a game-high 22 points. Davis also posted 12 rebounds and five blocks in 38 minutes, while Anderson also posted seven rebounds and two three-pointers in 33 minutes off the bench. New Orleans will have another tough matchup Saturday when they travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls.San Antonio has been trying to navigate one of the more treacherous parts of their schedule while resting players nightly to try and make sure they're healthy when the real games begin in the playoffs. As a result, they've lost six of their last seven games. Tony Parker returned for the last two games but did not play Friday, and it's unlcear whether he was simply being rested on the second game of a back-to-back set or if he aggravated his hamstring injury. Cory Joseph earned the start in his place. Kawhi Leonard (hand) continues to sit out indefinitely, giving Kyle Anderson another spot start at small forward. After sitting out Thursday's game with an illness, Boris Diaw was available to play Friday. He put up 10 points and six rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench. The Spurs gave up 20 easy points off of 17 turnovers, pointing to their greatest weakness Friday and the likely reason why they lost the game. San Antonio will host the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (21-10) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (9-21) 102-98 on Friday.Dallas stopped their two-game losing streak with the win. Rajon Rondo led the way with a game-high 21 points to go with eight rebounds and seven assists in 35 minutes. Six players scored in double figures for Mavericks, including Charlie Villanueva who scored 13 points in 21 minutes off the bench. Dallas is slowly but surely learning how to play with a guard like Rondo, and it's intriguing watching the pass-first point guard score more in the Mavs' system. They'll try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.Los Angeles played their third straight game without Kobe Bryant. Bryant continues to sit out due to general soreness as a result of his 36-year-old body having a lot of NBA miles on it. In two of the games Bryant missed, the Lakers have been competitive while sharing the ball, causing some to question how much Bryant has helped or hurt the team this season by his singular style of play. The Lakers shot just 36 percent from the floor and gave up 19 easy points off turnovers to give away Friday's game. Los Angeles has lost five of their last six games, and they'll try to stop the bleeding when they host the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.

												The Denver Nuggets (13-17) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-23) 106-102 on Friday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.In the victory in front of their home crowd, Denver shot 41 percent from the field, but only 16 percent from the three-point line. The Nuggets were forced into 18 turnovers, but made up for it by out-rebounding the Timberwolves a whopping 62-44. With so many rebounds, the Nuggets gave themselves many second-chance opportunities, which gave them just enough of an edge to secure the win.The Nuggets bench didn't provide much help in this game, combining to score only 19 of the 106 total points. Luckily, the starters were all on their game, with each scoring in double figures. Kenneth Faried had an absolutely monster day, going 11-for-15 from the field and scored 26 points, while also grabbing 25 rebounds. The points and rebounds were both season-highs for the forward and a good sight for the Nuggets, as Faried hasn't lived up to his expectations so far this season. Wilson Chandler also surpassed the 20-point mark, as he went off for 21 points (7-21 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and four rebounds. He's averaging 14.3 points and six rebounds on the season. Ty Lawson provided his sixteenth double-double of the season already. He finished the game with 16 points (6-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 11 assists. Aaron Afflalo and Timofey Mozgov recorded 13 and 11 points respectively.For the Timberwolves, Thaddeus Young and Andrew Wiggins led the way. Young went 10-for-21 from the field and 0-for-1 from the three-point line to score 23 points, while also adding six rebounds. As one of the more veteran players on the team, it was good seeing him get into a rhythm to help lead the younger guys. First overall pick Andrew Wiggins contributed 22 points (8-18 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-8 FT) and five rebounds. He's had a very successful streak of two games, combining for 49 points and seven rebounds over that span of time. Gorgui Dieng added another double-double to his resume, finishing with 14 points and 13 rebounds.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (24-7) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (4-24) 114-93 on Friday at the Moda Center in Portland.The Sixers just didn't have the offensive fire power to keep up with the Trail Blazers in this one. As a team, the Trail Blazers got off a ridiculous amount of three-point shots and converted on 18-of-43. The Sixers on the other hand went 3-for-14 from deep, putting them at a severe disadvantage. The Sixers were also out-rebounded 48-42.With LaMarcus Aldridge sitting out, both Damian Lillard and Wes Matthews took control of the game. Lillard went 9-for-17 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score 28 points, while also chipping in with nine assists. He has been unstoppable in his last two games, averaging 34 points, 10 assists and 5.5 rebounds over that span. Matthews went 9-for-18 from the floor and 7-for-14 from beyond the arc to finish with 25 points. He's now had consecutive games of 22 and 25 points, as he keeps increasing his season points average that is now at 16.4 points per game. The only other Blazer to reach double figures in points was Nicolas Batum who finished with 14 points (5-8 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-3 FT). Also, Joel Freeland had a season-high of 17 rebounds, as he was pushed into the starting lineup.The Sixers had a strong push from the bench in this one, with Tony Wroten and KJ McDaniels reaching double figures. Wroten went 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 22 points, while also adding four assists and a pair of steals. After shooting only 27 percent (3-11 FG) against the Magic last Sunday, it was good to see him with a bounce back game. McDaniels finished with 12 points and four rebounds. The rookie continues to be a pleasant surprise for the Sixers, as he has been very productive all year. The only starter to reach double-digit points was Michael Carter-Williams. He had 17 points (8-20 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-4 FT), six rebounds and five assists, as he's the Sixers best offensive option.   The Trail Blazers' next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Sunday, while the Sixers will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Saturday.

												The Phoenix Suns (17-14) defeated the Sacramento Kings (12-17) 115-106 on Friday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.Phoenix ended the third quarter riding a close 94-90 lead, but were able to out-score the Kings 21-16 in the final quarter to secure the nine-point win on the road. The Suns were the superior shooting team in this one, going 49 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three-point line, while the Kings went 44 percent from the floor and 35 percent from beyond the arc.The Suns were led by the Morris twins, who combined for 37 points. Marcus Morris came off the bench, going 7-for-12 from the field and 6-for-7 from the three-point line to score a team-leading 20 points, while also recording a near double-double with nine rebounds. The nine rebounds matched a season-high for Marcus, as he notched one of his most well-rounded games of the year. Markieff Morris on the other hand was just as efficient, shooting 8-for-11 from the field and 1-1 from beyond the arc. He finished the game with 17 points in 30 minutes of action. Eric Bledsoe stuffed the stat sheet again, scoring 18 points (7-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-5 FT), while also contributing five rebounds and six assists. He's now averaging 15.9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 5.8 assists on the year. Both Goran Dragic and Isaiah Thomas scored 16 and 17 points respectively.With DeMarcus Cousins sitting out, Rudy Gay and Darren Collison continued to be the most effective playmakers for the Kings. Collison had a team-high of 19 points (5-12 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 5-6 FT), while Gay finished with 16 (7-15 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT). Starting at center and receiving more minutes than he's accustomed to, Reggie Evans notched a surprise performance. He recorded 11 points and 16 rebounds, giving him his second double-double of the year. The Kings also received a lot of production of the bench with Derrick Williams, Omri Casspi and Carl Landry all reaching double figures in points. They scored 16, 11 and 12 points respectively. While the Kings offensive output wasn't something to hang thier heads about, they just didn't have enough of a defensive presence to slow the Suns down.  The Suns' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, while the Kings will be at home against the New York Knicks on Saturday.

Steven Adams had a big game as well against the defending champs, finishing with 16 points and a career-high 15 rebounds in 31 minutes for his own double-double. Five players scored in double figures for the Thunder, who broke a two-game losing streak to improve to 2-2 while Durant has been out with an ankle injury. Oklahoma City will return home to play the Charlotte Hornets on Friday. San Antonio has lost five of their last six games after Thursday's defeat. Kawhi Leonard missed his fifth game in a row with a hand injury. The Spurs are 3-5 without Leonard in the lineup. Boris Diaw also sat out of Thursday's game, most likely to get some rest since he wasn't on the injury report.

												The Miami Heat (14-16) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (17-11) 101-91 on Thursday.Miami came into the game losing three of their last four games, and with news that Chris Bosh would sit out his seventh straight game on Thursday. Despite this, Miami took control of the game early on, and remained in the lead before Cleveland made a run to take a two point lead in the fourth quarter. However, Miami responded by going on a 12-3 run to take the lead and ultimately get the win. Dwyane Wade led his team to the victory with 31 points, five assists and five rebounds in 37 minutes. Miami will play Memphis in the sixth game of their home stand on Saturday.Cleveland had won four of their last five games coming into their matchup with Miami. This was also the first game the team played since receiving news that starting center Anderson Varejao would miss the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles. The Cavaliers' big three combined to score 69 of the team’s 91 points; however, they were left with little production from the rest of the team. LeBron James finished with 30 points, eight assists, and four rebounds in his homecoming, but ultimately it wasn’t enough to get the win. Cleveland will travel to Orlando for the second half of a back-to-back road trip that concludes against the Magic.

												The Chicago Bulls (20-9) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (9-20) 113-93 on Thursday.Chicago was able to win their fifth consecutive game on Thursday with a nearly-healthy lineup against the Lakers. Kirk Hinrich sat out a second straight game with a hamstring issue. Chicago had control of this game since the beginning and never let Los Angeles take the lead in the game, despite giving up a 13-4 run to begin the third quarter. Five Bulls players scored in double figures, while three players scored over 20 points. Pau Gasol had a big game against his former team, finishing with 23 points and 13 rebounds for a double-double in 33 minutes. Chicago takes the court again on Saturday against New Orleans.Los Angeles found out earlier in the day that they would be without All-Star guard Kobe Bryant, who cited “old age” as the reason for his absence. Without Bryant, Los Angeles was able to beat conference leader Golden State on Tuesday, but they were unable to get a win in Chicago. Wesley Johnson was the Lakers’ scoring leader on Thursday with 19, while Ed Davis finished with 13 points and 14 rebounds for a his first career double-double as a member of the Lakers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (20-10) defeated the Golden State Warriors (23-5) 100-86 on Thursday.Los Angeles stopped their two-game losing streak with the win. Jamal Crawford paced the team with a game-high 24 points, while the Clippers shot just 39 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc as a team. They won the game at the foul line, going to the charity stripe 31 times compared to the Warriors' 22 trips to the free-throw line. Blake Griffin continued to rebound well, posting 18 points, 15 rebounds and six assists in 39 minutes. The Clippers will remain home to host the Toronto Raptors on Saturday.Golden State has lost their last two games, tying their longest losing streak of the season. As a team, they shot just 43 percent from the field and 21 percent from beyond the arc. Marreese Speights moved into the starting lineup with both Andrew Bogut (knee) and Festus Ezeli (ankle) out Thursday. Bogut is expected to start doing some on-court work in the next few days, but he likely remains at least a couple weeks away from returning.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (17-10) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-22) 125-104 on Tuesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.The Cavaliers used a dominant second half, out-scoring the Timberwovles 61-48, to coast to an easy 21-point victory at home in front of their home fans. Cleveland finished the game shooting 52 percent from the field and an impressive 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwovles shot 44 percent from the field and only 31 percent from beyond the arc. Kyrie Irving led the team, going 12-for-19 from the floor and 2-for-4 from deep to score a game-high of 29 points. While he was able to have success with his shot, he did turn the ball over a season-high of six times, so it wasn't all good for the point guard. LeBron James also had a big impact. He finished with 24 points, (8-16 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 4-5 FT) four rebounds and three blocks. He's now averaging 25.2 points, 7.8 assists and 5.2 rebounds on the year. Kevin Love was able to record a double-double, as he finished with 20 points (5-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and 10 rebounds. He got most of his offensive production from the free throw line, as he finished 9-of-11 from the line. Also, coming off the bench, Dion Waiters finished with 19 points and four assists. The Timberwolves received most of their production from their starters, as the bench wasn't much of an impact in this one. Andrew Wiggins had arguably his best offensive outing of the year, going 9-for-16 from the field and 3-for-3 from the three-point line to score 27 points. He was able to get to the free throw line eight times as well, converting on six of those attempts. Starting center Gorgui Dieng gave Wiggins the most help, as he recorded 20 points (6-10 FG, 8-8 FT) and 11 rebounds. It was his fifth double-double of the season. Shabazz Muhammad continued  to play well, as he finished with 18 points (7-17 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and six rebounds, while Thaddeus Young scored 13 points (6-18 FG, 1-2 FT) and had six rebounds of his own.   The Cavaliers' next game will on the road against the Miami Heat on Thursday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver to play the Nuggets on Friday.

												The Indiana Pacers (10-19) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (14-14) 96-84 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.While the Pacers took only a four-point lead into halftime, they came out strong in the third quarter and ended up out-scoring the Pelicans 52-44 in the second half to secure the victory at home. The Pacers were able to shoot 50 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, while the Pelicans shot only 40 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the arc. Roy Hibbert had a big night, finishing with 14 points (5-10 FG, 4-6 FT)  and four rebounds. His biggest impact came on the defensive side of the ball where he matched a season-high with seven blocks. It was the first time he's done that since the regular season opener. David West also continued to play well. He finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists, as he did a little bit of everything Tuesday. The Pacers did receive some solid contribution from the bench. In his first game of the season after sitting out with an injury, George Hill started the season hot, going 5-for-8 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 15 points in 21 minutes. It was a welcome sight for the Pacers seeing him back. CJ Miles also had 11 points off the bench.Anthony Davis had the most success for the Pelicans. Davis went 8-for-18 from the field and 5-for-6 from the free throw line to score 21 points, while also recording nine rebounds. It wasn't a monster game for him like he's had so many times in the last few weeks, but he still was the main focus for the Pelicans. Tyreke Evans was able to contribute 14 points and 11 rebounds. It was his fifth double-double of the season. Jrue Holiday had 16 points of his own while starting at point guard, despite going 0-for-5 from behind the three-point line. The starters just didn't get enough help from the bench in this one, as even the highly consistent Ryan Anderson finished with only four points (1-8 FG, 0-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 28 minutes. The Pacers' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Friday, while the Pelicans will be at home against the San Antonio Spurs on Friday.

												The Orlando Magic (11-20) defeated the Boston Celtics (10-16) 100-95 on Tuesday. Orlando put a stop to their four-game losing streak with the win. Tobias Harris scored a team-high 19 points, and both Kyle O'Quinn and Nikola Vucevic finished with double-doubles in the frontcourt. O'Quinn put up 18 points, 13 rebounds, two steals and one block. Vucevic posted 18 points, 12 rebounds and three assists. In his second game as the new starter at point guard, Elfrid Payton put up 12 points, seven assists and two steals in 29 minutes. The Magic plan to get a good look at this starting lineup that features O'Quinn and Payton for the foreseeable future, though the presence of Channing Frye and impending return of Aaron Gordon does put O'Quinn at risk of being marginalized again later this season. Orlando will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.Boston lost a second straight game and are now 1-2 in their three games since Rajon Rondo was traded to the Dallas Mavericks last Thursday. Jameer Nelson, who was acquired from the Mavs, started at point guard, pushing Marcus Smart back to a bench role. Nelson put up nine points, 11 assists and four steals in 30 minutes. Jared Sullinger played just nine minutes, and his role appears to be getting reduced as the Celtics' other big men continue to excel. Boston will host the Brooklyn Nets on Friday.

												The Chicago Bulls (19-9) defeated the Washington Wizards (19-8) 99-91 on Tuesday. Chicago has won four straight and seven of their last eight. Everything is looking good for the Bulls right now. They're winning, and they were finally able to play back-to-back games with a fully healthy roster after struggling to have everyone available on the same night most of this season. Derrick Rose returned to action Monday against the Raptors, and in his two games back, he's put up 29 points and 25 points. The early-season rust seems to be breaking off, and if Rose can stay healthy, a great performance on Christmas Day could be on tap for Thursday's game against the Lakers.Washington has lost back-to-back games for just the second time this season. John Wall had his hands full with Rose all night but still finished with 18 points and nine assists. Marcin Gortat pulled down a double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds, showing up well against the Bulls' army of big men. The competition will get a little easier for the Wizards when they take on the New York Knicks on Christmas Day.

												The Atlanta Hawks (21-7) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (19-10) 107-104 on Tuesday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.At the end of the third quarter, the Clippers were holding on to a 83-81 point lead over the Hawks, but Atlanta was able to out-score Los Angeles 26-21 in the fourth quarter to secure the victory at home. Despite being out-rebounded 51-41 by the Clippers, the Hawks were the superior shooters in this one, as they finished at 45 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three-point line, while the Clippers shot 40 percent from the field and only 38 percent from deep. The Hawks starters had a big night in this one. DeMarre Carroll went 9-for-12 from the field and 5-for-6 from the beyond the arc to score 25 points, while also grabbing 10 rebounds and notching his second double-double of the year. It was a season-high in points for Carroll and arguably his best game of the season thus far. Al Horford was also a force, finishing with 20 points (7-18 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and five rebounds. Considering he's averaging 14.5 points, it was good to seem him have a better offensive game than what we've come accustomed to. Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver both reached double figures in points as well. Millsap finished with 17 points (4-12 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-9 FT) and nine rebounds, while Korver had 14 points (4-9 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four assists. Chris Paul continued his strong play, as he went 7-for-18 from the field and 3-for-7 from deep to score 19 points. He also contributed seven assists, six rebounds and five steals, doing a little bit of everything for the Clippers. Blake Griffin finished with 21 points (9-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT), 11 assists and eight rebounds, coming just shy of a triple-double. The 11 assists were a season-high for him. DeAndre Jordan had a monster night on the boards, as he was a big reason the Clippers secured the rebounding advantage. Jordan finished with 15 points and 22 rebounds and has now had at least 10 rebounds in fourteen out of his last fifteen games. Coming off the bench, Jamal Crawford shot 5-for-19 from the field and 3-for-7 from deep to score 18 points, while recording seven rebounds.  The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday, while the Clippers will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Thursday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Los Angeles,Clippers,State Farm Arena,19,10,21,7,12.0,23.0,34.0,76.0,27.0,35.0,43.0,28.0,14.0,11.0,29.0,37.0,92.0,19.0,28.0,51.0,26.0,10.0,DeMarre Carroll,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,36,Matt Barnes,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,20,Paul Millsap,9.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,33,Blake Griffin,8.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,17.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,36,Al Horford,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,34,DeAndre Jordan,22.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,15.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,38,Kyle Korver,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,37,JJ Redick,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,34,Dennis Schroder,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,23,Chris Paul,6.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,18.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,38,Elton Brand,6.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Glen Davis,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Thabo Sefolosha,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,18,Jamal Crawford,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,19.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,29,Jeff Teague,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,23,Reggie Bullock,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11,Mike Scott,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Hedo Turkoglu,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Kent Bazemore,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Jordan Farmar,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,11

												The Brooklyn Nets (12-15) defeated the Denver Nuggets (12-17) 102-96 on Tuesday. Brooklyn has won two straight in what's been a topsy-turvy season for the veteran-laden team. Deron Williams sat out a second straight game with a calf issue, but Brook Lopez (back) was able to return to action after sitting out the last eight games. He played just eight minutes off the bench, and Lopez might stay in a reserve role due to how well the team has played with Mason Plumlee starting at center. Joe Johnson scored a team-high 27 points in 33 minutes. The Nets will go on the road to face the Boston Celtics on Friday.Denver has lost two straight games. They shot just 44 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, while also giving up 24 easy points on 18 turnovers Tuesday, essentially giving away the game. Ty Lawson finished with a game-high 29 points, and Kenneth Faried put up his best game of the season, finishing with 20 points and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes. The Nuggets will host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (4-23) defeated the Miami Heat (13-16) 91-87 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami. While Miami dominated the first half, getting out to a 57-42 lead, the Sixers had a huge second half, out-scoring the Heat 49-30 to steal a surprising victory on the road in Miami. After losing 23 of their first 25 games, the Sixers have now won two straight games, and will look to build on their momentum going forward. The Sixers received most of their production from Michael Carter-Williams and Luc Mbah A Moute. Williams finished 9-for-18 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also recording five assists and six steals. The six steals were a season-high for him, and he's now recorded 41 points over his last two games, as he continues to stay hot from the field. Mbah A Moute on the other hand went 8-for-16 from the floor and 0-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 19 points, along with six rebounds. It was a season-high in points for him, and a nice surprise for the Sixers after averaging only 8.9 points per game up until this point in the season. There was also some solid contributions off the bench from KJ McDaniels and Jerami Grant. McDaniels recorded 13 points (4-8 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and three rebounds, while Grant had 11 points (3-7 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-7 FT) and seven rebounds.The Heat were led by Dwyane Wade. He went 9-for-21 from the field, but 0-for-3 from the three-point line to finish with 23 points and six assists. He's been hot from the field lately, as he's averaging 30.2 points over his last four games. Shawne Williams also had a successful shooting performance, going 6-for-9 from the field and 3-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 17 points in 26 minutes. It was his second highest scoring output of the season, but wasn't enough to push the Heat to a victory. The only other Heat player to reach double figures in points was Mario Chalmers, who finished with 11 points (4-8 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and five rebounds.   The Sixers' next game will be on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, while the Heat will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday.  											",Miami,Heat,Philadelphia,76ers,AmericanAirlines Arena,4,23,13,16,8.0,26.0,33.0,80.0,13.0,18.0,39.0,13.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,Luol Deng,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,32,Robert Covington,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,35,Shawne Williams,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,26,Luc Mbah a Moute,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,38,Chris Andersen,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Nerlens Noel,10.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Dwyane Wade,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,21.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,33,JaKarr Sampson,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,20,Mario Chalmers,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,38,Michael Carter-Williams,3.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,20.0,9.0,18.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,44,Udonis Haslem,8.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,KJ McDaniels,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,31,Norris Cole,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,20,Henry Sims,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,15,Danny Granger,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,23,Jerami Grant,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,11.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,25,James Ennis III,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,15,Furkan Aldemir,,,,,,,,,,,,Hassan Whiteside,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5,Malcolm Thomas,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Charlotte Hornets (10-19) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (14-15) 108-101 on Tuesday.Charlotte has won four straight games, and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule (Sixers, Jazz, Nuggets, Bucks), the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance Stephenson (groin) sitting out as the reason for the Hornets' success. Stephenson has missed the last four games, coinciding with the Hornets' resurgence, and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late, putting all the blame on one player is misleading. Kemba Walker led with the way Tuesday, putting up a team-high 27 points in 36 minutes. Charlotte will go on the road to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.Milwaukee has dropped two straight and three of their last four games as they struggle to try and fill the hole of Jabari Parker (knee) being out for the rest of the season.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (23-7) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (13-16) 115-111 on Tuesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.In a game of runs, the Trail Blazers and Thunder found themselves locked up following the fourth quarter, but in overtime the Trail Blazers were able to use a team-effort to outlast the Thunder and steal the four-point victory on the road. The Blazers used an outstanding three-point outing, going 55 percent from beyond the arc, while the Thunder shot only 32 percent from deep. LaMarcus Aldridge, Wesley Matthews and Damian Lillard provided 87 of the teams total of 115 points. Lillard was unstoppable, going 11-for-21 from the field and a ridiculous 8-for-12 from the three-point line to score 40 points. He also converted on 10-of-11 attempts from the free throw line and chipped in with 11 assists. It was his third double-double of the season and he's now averaging 21.3 points and 6.1 assists on the year. Aldridge was a force as well, scoring 25 points (9-28 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and adding nine rebounds. He's now averaged 28 points per game over his last three outings. Matthews wasn't far behind either, going 8-for-15 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score 22 points, with a few clutch buckets in overtime. Not to be outdone by Lillard, Russell Westbrook posted a 40-point (16-34 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 7-9 FT), 10-rebound game of his own. He's been a scoring machine thus far this season, averaging 27.4 points over his first 15 games of the season. Serge Ibaka also played well despite the loss. He finished with 16 points (7-14 FG, 2-3 3Pt), seven rebounds and four blocked shots before fouling out. It was a nice bounce back game for him after scoring only six points on Sunday. Coming off the bench, Reggie Jackson did his part, scoring 21 points (8-17 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and grabbing nine rebounds. Despite many players with positive contributions, the Thunder couldn't get it done with Kevin Durant sitting out with an ankle injury.     The Trail Blazers' next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday, while the Thunder will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Thursday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Portland,Trail Blazers,Chesapeake Energy Arena,23,7,13,16,6.0,19.0,46.0,101.0,13.0,15.0,53.0,20.0,11.0,17.0,31.0,38.0,91.0,22.0,24.0,46.0,22.0,14.0,Perry Jones III,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,25,Allen Crabbe,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,24,Serge Ibaka,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,16.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,33,LaMarcus Aldridge,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,25.0,9.0,28.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,44,Steven Adams,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Joel Freeland,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Andre Roberson,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,20,Wesley Matthews,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,15.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,42,Russell Westbrook,10.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,40.0,16.0,34.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,38,Damian Lillard,6.0,11.0,2.0,0.0,40.0,11.0,21.0,8.0,12.0,2.0,45,Reggie Jackson,9.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,17.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,36,Chris Kaman,9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,21,Kendrick Perkins,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Steve Blake,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,34,Anthony Morrow,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,29,CJ McCollum,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,11,Nick Collison,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Thomas Robinson,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Ish Smith,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Dorell Wright,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

												The Phoenix Suns (16-14) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (20-10) 124-115 on Tuesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.Despite a 41-point fourth quarter, the Mavericks weren't able to buckle down defensively Tuesday and let the Suns score 124 points, giving them the nine-point victory. Despite shooting better from the field and out-rebounding the Suns 49-44, the Mavericks committed 20 turnovers, giving the Suns enough of an advantage to secure the victory at home. The Suns found production from all over the court. Goran Dragic led all scorers, going 10-for-17 from the floor and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 25 points. He's now averaging 16 points per game on the season. Despite struggling with his shot, Eric Bledsoe had a huge game, scoring 16 points (6-19 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT), while recording 11 assists and 10 rebounds, giving him his second triple-double of the season. He was getting everything he wanted in this one, and was a big reason for the Suns' victory. Alex Len also was big as he finished with 17 points (6-9 FG, 5-7 FT) and seven rebounds before fouling out. The bench had a strong showing from Gerald Green and Isaiah Thomas. Green totaled 22 points, while Thomas finished with 12.The Mavericks were led by the duo of Tyson Chandler and Dirk Nowitzki. Chandler was a force, scoring 22 points (6-8 FG, 10-12 FT) and grabbing 14 rebounds. It was his thirteenth double-double of the season and third straight game with at least 14 rebounds. Nowitzki shot 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from deep to score 22 points, while also grabbing five rebounds. It was the most points he's had in the last four games. In Rondo's third game with the team, he finished with 13 points (6-14 FG, 1-1 3Pt), six rebounds and eight assists, as he did a little bit of everything Tuesday. Also, coming off the bench, Charlie Villanueva had a strong showing, going 7-for-13 from the field and 4-for-9 from beyond the arc to score 18 points.  The Suns' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Friday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (9-19) defeated the Golden State Warriors (23-4) 115-105 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Despite out-scoring the Lakers 32-20 in the final quarter, the Lakers were able to hold off the late comeback, and secure a victory in front of their home fans. The Lakers were able to shoot 52 percent from the field and 46 percent from the three-point line, while the Warriors shot 46 percent from the floor and 46 percent from beyond the arc. Even with Kobe Bryant sitting out on a day of rest, the Lakers were still able to pull off the victory, as they had seven players reach double figures in points. Carlos Boozer went 8-for-11 from the field to score 18 points, while also grabbing nine rebounds in the process. It was a nice outing for him, as he's averaged only 12.8 points thus far this season. Nick Young also had a solid contribution off the bench, scoring 15 points (5-13 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and pulling down five rebounds. While it was surprising he didn't get off a ridiculous amount of shots without Bryant in the game, he still was able to match his season average in points. Ronnie Price, Wesley Johnson and Ed Davis also were fundamental in the victory. They scored 17, 14 and 14 respectively, with Davis going a perfect 7-for-7 from the field. The Warriors were led by their superstar backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Curry went 10-for-14 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 22 points, while adding six assists. After an off game on Monday, this was a solid bounce back outing for Curry, although the seven turnovers he recorded wasn't acceptable. Thompson on the other hand went 6-for-15 from the field and 4-for-8 from beyond the arc to score 18 points. While the two guards played well, they didn't receive much help from the rest of the team. David Lee had the most production of everyone else, scoring 12 points and pulling in seven rebounds. Starters Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes struggled to get anything going, scoring two and five points respectively.  The Lakers' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, while the Warriors will stay in Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Thursday. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Golden State,Warriors,Staples Center,23,4,9,19,12.0,26.0,46.0,89.0,11.0,17.0,42.0,28.0,16.0,10.0,22.0,35.0,77.0,14.0,15.0,32.0,16.0,18.0,Wesley Johnson,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,25,Harrison Barnes,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,27,Ed Davis,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Draymond Green,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Jordan Hill,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Festus Ezeli,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Wayne Ellington,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,25,Klay Thompson,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,6.0,15.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,30,Ronnie Price,4.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,30,Stephen Curry,2.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,22.0,10.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,29,Carlos Boozer,9.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,26,Marreese Speights,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,20,Jeremy Lin,1.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,24,Andre Iguodala,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,15,Nick Young,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,30,David Lee,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Robert Sacre,2.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Shaun Livingston,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Jordan Clarkson,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Justin Holiday,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,18

												The Charlotte Hornets (9-19) defeated the Denver Nuggets (12-16) 110-82 on Monday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.The Hornets came out firing in this game early, out-scoring the Nuggets 58-40 in the first half. They were able to play stellar defense all night, holding the Nuggets under 20 points in both the first and third quarters. They were also able to keep the Nuggets shooting percentage to only 38 percent from the field and 11 percent from the three-point line, while shooting 54 percent from the field and 42 percent from beyond the arc themselves. The Hornets were led by Al Jefferson, who shot 10-for-13 from the field to score 22 points, while also bringing in seven rebounds. He continues to be the team's most consistent player, as he's averaging 19.2 points and 8.3 rebounds on the year. Kemba Walker also had a solid all-around game. He came one assist shy of a double-double, as he recorded 18 points (5-12 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and nine assists. He's averaging 23.8 points over the last five games, as his offensive output has really increased recently. The Hornets also got plenty of production off the bench. Gary Neal shot 5-for-8 from the floor and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 13 points, while PJ Hairston recorded his first double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Nuggets had a tough night offensively Monday. Ty Lawson was one of the lone bright spots, as he went 8-for-15 from the floor and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 18 points. Despite averaging 10.4 assists on the season, he only had four in this one, and ended his five game streak of recording 10 or more assists. Alonzo Gee was the only other Nugget to reach double figures in points, as he finished with a surprising 15-point performance off the bench. It was a season-high for Gee, who's only scored more than 10 points in two other games this season. Arron Afflalo didn't have his best night from the field, as he went only 4-for-12 from the field and 0-for-3 from the three-point line to finish with nine points.  The Hornets' next game will be on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Tuesday.

												The Chicago Bulls (18-9) defeated the Toronto Raptors (22-7) 129-120 on Monday at the United Center in Chicago. In a high scoring game marked with a poor showing of defense between the two teams, the Bulls were able to show off superior shooting, going 54 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line. They went absolutely insane in the fourth quarter, scoring 49 points, compared to 37 from the Raptors. The Raptors finished at 44 percent from the field and 30 percent from beyond the arc.The Bulls were led by the duo of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler. Rose shot outstanding in this one, going 12-for-19 from the field, although 0-for-3 from the three-point line. He finished with 29 points, giving him his second highest scoring output of the season thus far. He's now averaging 16.8 points on the season. Butler on the other hand nearly matched Rose with 27 points (7-16 FG, 2-3 3Pt) of his own. He was able to get to the line 11 times, converting on a perfect 11-of-11. He also had 11 rebounds and five blocks, marking his second game in a row with a double-double. Pau Gasol nearly had a double-double of his own, as he finished with 14 points (2-7 FG, 10-10 FT) and nine rebounds. The Bulls did receive a big boost from their bench, as Aaron Brooks and Nikola Mirotic scored 17 and 12 points respectively. Kyle Lowry did everything he could to keep up with the Bulls outstanding shooting performance. Lowry shot 12-for-22 from the field and 4-for-8 from the three-point line to score 34 points, while also adding six rebounds and three assists. He's now combined for 56 points over the last two games, as he continues to stay hot on the offensive side of the ball. Jonas Valanciunas also had a big game, scoring 20 points (8-18 FG, 4-6 FT) and grabbing nine rebounds. Like Lowry, his offensive game has improved over the last week, as Valanciunas is averaging 15.8 points over his last four games. Terrence Ross showed off his stroke as well, going 6-for-16 from the field and 5-for-11 from beyond the arc. He scored 17 points, before fouling out late in the fourth quarter. Louis Williams and Patrick Patterson had solid outings off the bench, with each adding 12 points respectively.    The Bulls' next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday, while the Raptors will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Saturday.

												The Houston Rockets (20-7) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (22-7) 110-95 on Monday.Houston put a stop to their two-game losing streak with the win. James Harden wasn't going to let the Rockets lose a third straight game. He put up a game-high 44 points and seven assists in 32 minutes. Corey Brewer and Alexey Shved, acquired in a three-team trade on Friday, made their debuts with the team. Brewer put up 12 points, four rebounds, four assists and five steals in 23 minutes off the bench, while Shved put up three points in 11 minutes off the bench. The Rockets will go on the road Friday to take on the Grizzlies in Memphis.Portland saw their five-game winning streak come to an end with the loss. LaMarcus Aldridge sat out the game with an illness, thrusting Meyers Leonard into the starting lineup at power forward. Robin Lopez (hand) will remain out for about seven more weeks, so the Trail Blazers were running out their backup frontcourt of Leonard and Joel Freeland. Leonard finished with 13 points and four rebounds in 32 minutes. He even converted three three-pointers, showing off the new skill he developed in the offseason. With the game out of reach for most of the second half, coach Terry Stotts gave extra minutes to his bench. C.J. McCollum put on a show with 17 points and three steals in 27 minutes. Portland is on a back-to-back set, they'll play the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.

												The Utah Jazz (9-20) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (21-7) 97-91 on Monday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis. The Jazz secured a surprising victory over one of the best teams in the Western Conference on Monday. Despite turning the ball over eight more times than the Grizzlies, the Jazz were able to out-rebound them 49-34, which gave them just enough of an advantage to steal the victory on the road. The Jazz had four starters reach double figures in points in this one. Alec Burks led the team with 23 points (7-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 7-8 FT) and four assists. After struggling offensively with his shot in the past two outings, Burks was able to turn it around against the Grizzlies, and give them a a big boost in the win. Gordon Hayward was also a solid contributor, as he shot 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while also adding four rebounds and four assists. He's now averaging 18.9 points and 5.3 rebounds on the year. Coming one rebound short of a double-double, Enes Kanter finished with 13 points and nine rebounds. He only had four points on Saturday, so it was good to see him get back on track. Also, coming off the bench, Rudy Gobert had a monster day on the boards, recording 16 rebounds despite scoring only two points. He was a big reason the Jazz took home the rebounding advantage.The Grizzlies got most of their production from Mike Conley and Marc Gasol, as both were able to get off 22 shots of their own. Gasol went 10-for-22 from the field to score 24 points, while also grabbing 12 rebounds. Continuing to show himself as one of the best centers in the league, it was Gasol's third straight double-double. Conley on the other  hand went 12-for-22 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 28 points. It was good enough for his second highest scoring output of the season. The only other starter to have any sort of production was Courtney Lee, who despite going 0-for-7 from the three-point line, scored 13 points in 37 minutes. Vince Carter led the bench with 12 points (4-7 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in 21 minutes.The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday, while the Grizzlies will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Friday. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Utah,Jazz,FedExForum,9,20,21,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tayshaun Prince,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,23,Gordon Hayward,4.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,36,Kosta Koufos,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Derrick Favors,7.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,35,Marc Gasol,12.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,22.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,36,Enes Kanter,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,30,Courtney Lee,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,37,Alec Burks,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,34,Mike Conley,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,28.0,12.0,22.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,31,Trey Burke,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,26,Beno Udrih,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,19,Rudy Gobert,16.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Vince Carter,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,21,Dante Exum,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,21,Jon Leuer,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,26,Rodney Hood,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,21,Jordan Adams,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10,Joe Ingles,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Nick Calathes,,,,,,,,,,,,Patrick Christopher,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Atlanta Hawks (20-7) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (20-9) 105-102 on Monday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.Following the end of the third quarter, the Hawks had out-scored the Mavericks 82-63, but the Mavericks came out in the fourth on fire and were able to out-score the Hawks 39-23. Despite a huge late game effort, the Mavericks just didn't have enough left in the tank to finish the comeback and suffered a tough three-point loss in front of their home fans. The Hawks received a huge effort from their starting five in this one, with all reaching double-digits in points. Dennis Schroder led the team with 22 points and six assists, going 9-for-15 from the field and 4-for-8 from the free throw line. It was a season-high in points for him, as he's only averaging 8.6 points per game on the year. Kyle Korver also found success with his shot, going 4-for-8 from the field and 3-for-6 from beyond the arc to score 18 points. He was able to get to the free throw line eight times, and converted on seven of those eight attempts. Recording his sixth double-double of the season, Paul Millsap recorded 13 points and 12 rebounds. He's now averaging 16.3 points and 7.8 rebounds on the year. DeMarre Carroll and Al Horford contributed 15 and 17 points respectively, helping edge the Hawks to a victory. The Mavericks were led by Monta Ellis, who shot 8-for-22 from the field, but only 1-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 18 points. Coming off a 38-point performance on Saturday, Ellis didn't shoot quite as well, but he still continues to get off nearly 20 shots every game. Dirk Nowitzki had 16 points (6-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-4 FT) of his own, while also chipping in with six rebounds. He's now averaging 18.6 points and 5.8 rebounds on the season. In only his second game of the season with the Mavericks, Rajon Rondo notched his first double-double with his new team, recording 13 points and 11 assists. He should get plenty of opportunities for assists with so many more offensive weapons along side of him.

												The San Antonio Spurs (18-11) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (19-9) 125-118 on Monday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.The Spurs seemingly could not miss in this game, as they finished at 64 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three-point line. The Clippers shot decent at 50 percent from the field and 43 percent from beyond the arc, but it wasn't enough to keep up with the electric Spurs team.The Spurs were led by Tony Parker, who shot 11-for-18 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 26 points, while also adding four assists. It was Parker's first game in over week after dealing with a hamstring injury, and he came back firing with a huge night on the offensive side of the ball. Tim Duncan also had a strong showing, scoring 21 points and recording 12 rebounds. It was his third double-double in a row, as he's averaged 25.3 points and 12.7 rebounds over those three games. The Spurs also had a lot of help off the bench from both Manu Ginobili and Boris Diaw. Ginobili finished with 19 points (7-11 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and 10 assists, while Diaw recorded 23 points (9-11 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 3-8 FT) and six rebounds. With that kind of production, the Spurs may be impossible to beat. Despite a ridiculous shooting performance from the Spurs, the Clippers kept it close with Blake Griffin, JJ Redick and Chris Paul all scoring over 20 points. Paul led the way with 25 points (8-17 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 6-7 FT) and nine assists. Over the last two games he's combined for 52 points and 18 rebounds, as he's stayed hot on the offensive side of the ball. Griffin finished with 22 points (10-20 FG, 2-4 FT), six rebounds and six assists. Griffin did a little bit of everything in this one, pushing his season averages to 23.1 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game. Redick shot 6-for-13 from the field and 5-for-8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points. It was his second game in a row scoring over 20 points, despite averaging only 14.8 points on the year. Jamal Crawford also played well, scoring 18 points (6-15 FG, 0-5 3Pt, 6-6 FT) off the bench. The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, while the Clippers will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Tuesday. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Los Angeles,Clippers,AT&T Center,19,9,18,11,13.0,22.0,48.0,75.0,14.0,22.0,31.0,37.0,11.0,10.0,24.0,43.0,86.0,22.0,29.0,36.0,23.0,10.0,Kyle Anderson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,9,Matt Barnes,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,23,Tim Duncan,12.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,9.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Blake Griffin,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,10.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,37,Tiago Splitter,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,DeAndre Jordan,11.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Danny Green,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,29,JJ Redick,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,34,Tony Parker,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,26.0,11.0,18.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,33,Chris Paul,4.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,25.0,8.0,17.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,33,Marco Belinelli,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,28,Jamal Crawford,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,27,Manu Ginobili,2.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,27,Jordan Farmar,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,14,Boris Diaw,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,25,Glen Davis,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Cory Joseph,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17,Reggie Bullock,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10,Aron Baynes,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9,Hedo Turkoglu,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10

												The Golden State Warriors (23-3) defeated the Sacramento Kings (12-16) 128-108 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors got up quickly in this one, out-scoring the Kings 36-20 in the first quarter and 64-50 by the end of the second quarter. The Warriors finished the game shooting 54 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line, as the Kings didn't have enough of a defensive presence to keep them in check. The Warriors also out-rebounded the Kings 45-39, giving them even more of an edge.Stephen Curry wasn't his usual self on the offensive side of the ball, scoring only 12 points, but was still able to hand out 11 assists, getting his team involved despite his struggles. It was his lowest scoring output in the last fourteen games. Klay Thompson on the other hand picked up the slack, shooting 10-for-16 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 25 points. He's averaged 24 points per game over his last five outings. In only 17 minutes, Festus Ezeli was extremely efficient and scored 15 points (7-11 FG, 1-2 FT), while grabbing six rebounds. It was a season-high for Ezeli, who hadn't reached double figures yet this year. Also, in a surprise performance off the bench, Justin Holiday went 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 18 points. He's scored a total of only 11 points in 11 games so far this season, so this performance came out of nowhere. As usual, the Kings were led by DeMarcus Cousins who scored 22 points (9-19 FG, 4-6 FT), while also adding eight rebounds and six assists. He's been an absolute force lately, averaging 26.8 points over his last four games. Darren Collison also had a solid all-around game. He went 7-for-14 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 17 points, while recording five assists. He's now averaging 15.7 points per game, and has gotten hot offensively over his last three games. Coming off the bench, Omri Casspi shot well, going 7-for-10 from the field and 2-for-4 from the free throw line to record 16 points and eight rebounds.  Averaging only 8.2 points this season, it was a nice surprise for the Kings. Rudy Gay finished with 13 points and nine rebounds. The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Kings will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Friday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Sacramento,Kings,Chase Center,12,16,23,3,9.0,25.0,46.0,87.0,19.0,22.0,44.0,34.0,12.0,7.0,15.0,41.0,84.0,14.0,21.0,38.0,24.0,13.0,Harrison Barnes,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,26,Rudy Gay,9.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,36,Draymond Green,8.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,25,Jason Thompson,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Festus Ezeli,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,DeMarcus Cousins,8.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,9.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Klay Thompson,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,10.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,27,Ben McLemore,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,32,Stephen Curry,2.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,26,Darren Collison,2.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,14.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,32,Andre Iguodala,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,23,Derrick Williams,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,Marreese Speights,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Omri Casspi,8.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Shaun Livingston,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Ramon Sessions,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6,David Lee,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Carl Landry,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Justin Holiday,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,20,Nik Stauskas,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,9

												The Raptors (22-6) got 22 points and nine assists from Kyle Lowry en route to a 118-108 win over the Knicks (5-25) on Sunday.Toronto jumped out to an eight-point first quarter lead and never looked back, maintaining a seven-point advantage at the half. The Raptors turned it on in the third quarter, beginning the period on a 17-7 run and extending the lead to 16 points entering the fourth. Lowry’s 22 led the way for Toronto, and the point guard was serenaded with “MVP” chants from fans while at the free throw line in the fourth quarter. Jonas Valanciunas added 10 points, and Terrence Ross finished with 18, including four three-pointers. Lou Williams contributed 22 points off the bench, and Greivis Vasquez had 21 to go with five assists. The Raptors shot nearly 49 percent from the floor and knocked down 14 three-pointers as a team.The Knicks were led by 28 points (12-26 FG) and five rebounds from Carmelo Anthony. Jose Calderon added 15, and Cole Aldrich, who started at center with Amare Stoudemire resting, finished with 11 points and seven rebounds. Jason Smith was the high man off the bench with 16 points in 21 minutes.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (15-10) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (21-5) 105-91 on Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.The Cleveland Cavaliers used their superior shooting and a 28-21 fourth quarter advantage in points to get the win. The team shot 61 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, while the Grizzlies shot only 45 percent from the field and a meager six percent from beyond the arc. Despite turning the ball over more than the Grizzlies and being out-rebounded, the Cavaliers held on and secured their second straight win in front of their home fans.  LeBron James led all scorers, as he went 9-for-15 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 25 points, while also chipping in 11 assists. This was his tenth double-double on the year, as he's now averaging 25.3 points, 7.7 assists and 5.4 rebounds on the season. Dion Waiters also had a solid outing and finished with 21 points, marking the second time in the last three games that he's finished with that number. He'll look to stay consistent off the bench in his next few games. Both Kyrie Irving and Anderson Varejao also reached double figures in scoring. Irving went 8-for-13 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line, while Varejao finished 9-for-12 from the field for 18 points. Despite playing 35 minutes, Kevin Love didn't have much of an impact, as he finished with only eight points. This was his second straight game struggling to score, so he'll look to get things turned around as soon as possible. The Grizzlies were led by Marc Gasol, who went 10-for-17 from the field and 3-for-4 from the free throw line to score 23 points. He also added 11 rebounds, giving him his second double-double in a row. He's now averaging 19.7 points and eight rebounds on the season. Jon Leuer was also a big contributor in the loss. He made his first start of the season and finished with 16 points and seven rebounds in 30 minutes on the court. Mike Conley and Vince Carter were the only other two Grizzlies to reach double figures with 11 and 12 points respectively. With the team shooting only 1-for-16 from the three-point line, it was tough for them to keep up offensively with the Cavaliers who found their stroke early and often in this one. The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday, while the Grizzlies will play the Utah Jazz on Monday.

												The Sacramento Kings (12-15) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (8-19) 108-101 on Sunday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.The Kings were able to use a strong second half, where they out-scored the Lakers 56-41 to coast to a seven-point victory at home in front of their home crowd. The Kings were able to shoot 48 percent from the field, while the Lakers shot only 38 percent, as that was enough to give the Kings the advatage.The group consisting of Rudy Gay, DeMarcus Cousins, Ben McLemore and Darren Collison combined to score all but 13 points in this matchup against the Lakers. Cousins led all scorers with 29 points and 14 rebounds. He was able to get to the free throw line 15 times and converted on 11 of those attempts. Gay on the other hand shot 8-for-15 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 24 points, while also chipping in six assists. He's now averaging 21.2 points and 6.3 rebounds on the season. McLemore contributed 23 points (10-18 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and eight rebounds. He's now surpassed the 20-point mark for the second straight game, despite averaging only 12.4 points on the year. Shooting 7-for-13 from the field and 2-for-4 from beyond the arc, Darren Collison scored 19 points in 40 minutes.The Lakers received most of their scoring from both Nick Young and Kobe Bryant. Bryant got off a ridiculous 30 shots, and was able to convert on only eight of them. He also went 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score 25 points in 37 minutes. He was pretty careless with the ball though, as he added a wopping nine turnovers in the loss. Young came off the bench to hit 7-of-14 shots from the field and 4-of-9 shots from beyond the arc to score 26 points. He went a perfect 8-for-8 from the line as well. The only other Laker to reach double figures in points was Ed Davis, who scored 10 points to go along with five rebounds.   The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Monday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday. 											",Sacramento,Kings,Los Angeles,Lakers,Golden 1 Center,8,19,12,15,7.0,22.0,36.0,74.0,24.0,35.0,42.0,14.0,14.0,10.0,26.0,33.0,87.0,25.0,30.0,47.0,14.0,16.0,Rudy Gay,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,24.0,8.0,15.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,38,Wesley Johnson,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,21,Jason Thompson,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Ed Davis,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,DeMarcus Cousins,14.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,29.0,9.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,37,Jordan Hill,9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Ben McLemore,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,10.0,18.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,37,Kobe Bryant,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,25.0,8.0,30.0,3.0,8.0,9.0,37,Darren Collison,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,40,Ronnie Price,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,27,Carl Landry,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Nick Young,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,26.0,7.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,30,Reggie Evans,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7,Carlos Boozer,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Ryan Hollins,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Jeremy Lin,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,20,Ray McCallum,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,11,Robert Sacre,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Nik Stauskas,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5,Wayne Ellington,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10

												The Nets (11-15) handed the Pistons (5-23) their fourth straight loss, holding on for a 110-105 victory Sunday evening.Brooklyn jumped out to a 10-point first quarter lead, but the Pistons responded with a run in the second quarter that trimmed the deficit to just two at halftime. The teams traded baskets for most of the third quarter, and the Nets were able to create some distance mid-way through the fourth, as a Mason Plumlee lay-in gave Brooklyn a 12-point advantage with 4:24 to play. Detroit would battle back, however, with back-to-back baskets from Andre Drummond cutting Brooklyn’s lead to just two points with 40 seconds to play. Trailing 104-102 with less than 30 seconds to play, Detroit had a chance to take the lead, but a Jodie Meeks three-pointer rimmed out with 15 seconds remaining. From there, the Nets were able to salt the game away at the line, as Joe Johnson knocked down four straight free throws. The win snapped a three-game skid.Brooklyn, which scorched the nets to the tune of 52.6 percent shooting, got 21 points and 12 rebounds from Plumlee and 16 points from Johnson. Starting in place of the injured Deron Williams, Jarrett Jack finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Mirza Teletovic chipped in 13 points off the bench. Bojan Bogdanovic added 14 points with three three-pointers.Detroit placed six players in double-figures, led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s 20 points. Andre Drummond added 18 points and 20 rebounds (13 offensive), and Josh Smith contributed 13 points, six assists and five boards. It was a rough night for Brandon Jennings, who had just eight points on 3-of-12 shooting. He did finish with eight assists, however.

												The Miami Heat (13-15) defeated the Boston Celtics (10-15) 100-84 on Sunday at the American Airlines Arena in Miami Florida. The Heat did most of their damage in the first half, out-scoring the Celitcs 52-42. They were able to finish the game shooting 47 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three-point line, while the Celtics shot 40 percent from the floor and 26 percent from beyond the arc. The Heat were able to force the Celitcs into 15 turnovers, giving them an even greater advantage to take home the victory. The Heat had six players reach double figures in points in this one. Luol Deng led all scorers with 23 points, after shooting 9-for-15 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line. He also went a perfect 4-of-4 from the free throw line. With Dwyane Wade sitting out, Mario Chalmers got pushed into the starting lineup, where he took advantage of the extra playing time and recorded his fourth double-double of the season with 11 points (5-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 1-4 FT) and 10 assists. Although it wasn't his best day shooting from the floor, he still made up for it with the opportunities he gave to his teammates. Norris Cole also benefitted from some extra playing time and scored 15 points in 37 minutes. The fifteen points were the most he's had since scoring 23 points in the season opener and the minutes played was near a season-high. James Ennis also provided a big boost off the bench with 16 points (4-8 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and eight rebounds. It was a season-high in points for him as he has only reached double figures in points once before. The Celtics struggled to find any consistent offense in their young lineup. Tyler Zeller did most of the damage for them as he went 10-for-15 from the floor and 2-for-3 from the free throw line to score 22 points, while also grabbing eight rebounds. It was only the second time Zeller has broken the 20-point mark this season. Both Jeff Green and Kelly Olynyk chipped in 13 points of there own, but without much contribution from the bench, the Celtics came up a quite a bit short.    The Heat's next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday, while the Celitcs will travel to Orlando to play the magic on Tuesday. 											",Miami,Heat,Boston,Celtics,AmericanAirlines Arena,10,15,13,15,,,,,,,,,,6.0,22.0,33.0,81.0,12.0,15.0,40.0,21.0,15.0,Luol Deng,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,36,Jeff Green,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,33,Shawne Williams,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,30,Jared Sullinger,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,20,Chris Andersen,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24,Tyler Zeller,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22.0,10.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Norris Cole,4.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,37,Avery Bradley,7.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,32,Mario Chalmers,2.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,35,Marcus Smart,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,28,Udonis Haslem,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Evan Turner,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,26,James Ennis III,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,26,Brandon Bass,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Justin Hamilton,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Kelly Olynyk,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,28,Danny Granger,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,17,Jameer Nelson,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,20,Andre Dawkins,,,,,,,,,,,,Brandan Wright,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13

												The Philadelphia 76ers (3-23) defeated the Orlando Magic (10-20) 96-88 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando.Despite being down 42-37 at half, the Sixers came out strong in the third quarter and out-scored the Magic 59-46 to finish the second half and steal the victory on the road. The Sixers were able to out-rebound the Magic 52-43, giving them just enough of an advantage to coast to the victory. The Sixers were led by Michael Carter-Williams, who went 7-for-12 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 21 points in 36 minutes, while also handing out six assists. He was also able to convert on 6-of-8 free throws.He's now averaging 15.7 points, 7.7 assists and seven rebounds on the season. Nerlens Noel was able to notch his fourth double-double of the season, as he finished with 13 points (5-13 FG, 3-3 FT) and 12 rebounds. He's combined for 29 rebounds in the last three games, as he's now averaging 6.8 rebounds on the year. Robert Covington had a double-double of his own with 11 points and 10 rebounds. It was the first double-double he's recorded all year. Both Henry Sims and Tony Wroten produced the most points off the bench as they combined for 22 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists. The Magic saw the majority of their production come from Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic. Oladipo went 10-for-16 from the field and 1-for-5 from the three-point line to score 23 points. After playing poorly in a few of his previous games, it was nice to see Oladipo have a bounce back effort and get back to playing well. Vucevic on the other hand was a force on the boards, as he collected 17 rebounds to go along with the 19 points he scored.

They shot 41 percent from the field and 21 percent from beyond the arc. Though Washington only committed 11 turnovers, they allowed 20 easy points off the giveaways, putting the game out of reach given their lack of efficiency on offense.

												The Indiana Pacers (9-19) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-21) 100-96 on Sunday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.Despite a fierce comeback by the Timberwolves, who out-scored the Pacers 58-48 in the second half, the Pacers were able to hold them off and steal the victory on the road. The Timberwolves secured the rebounding advantage in this game, as they out-rebounded the Pacers 43-36, but the Pacers were able to use their superior shooting and pull out the victory. CJ Miles made the biggest impact for the Pacers. He came off the bench to shoot 10-for-18 from the field and 4-for-11 from the three-point line to score 28 points, while also chipping in six rebounds. It was two points off a season high for Miles, who pushed his season average to 11.3 points on the year. Roy Hibbert finished with 15 points (6-11 FG, 3-4 FT) and eight rebounds. After failing to score on Saturday, Hibbert had somewhat of a bounce back game and scored at least 15 points for the first time in three weeks.

Williams went 10-for-16 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 24 points, while also handing out 10 assists. It was his fifth double-double of the season. Muhammad has now combined to score 96 points in his last four games, as he's become a central piece to the Timberwolves offense with all of the injuries. He's now averaging 13.2 points and 3.7 rebounds on the season. Chase Budinger had a solid day off the bench, as he shot 6-for-10 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 13 points. The only other Timberwolve to reach double figures in points was Gorgui Dieng, who scored 10 points and grabbed seven rebounds. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the New orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Tuesday. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Indiana,Pacers,Target Center,9,19,5,21,5.0,11.0,36.0,76.0,19.0,24.0,42.0,23.0,16.0,6.0,19.0,42.0,84.0,10.0,14.0,36.0,25.0,13.0,Shabazz Muhammad,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,37,Solomon Hill,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,32,Thaddeus Young,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,David West,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,14.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Gorgui Dieng,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,32,Roy Hibbert,8.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,15.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,Andrew Wiggins,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Rodney Stuckey,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Zach LaVine,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16,C.J.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (22-6) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (13-13) 114-88 on Saturday. Portland extended their win streak to five games with the victory. Nicolas Batum (wrist/knee) returned to the starting lineup after sitting out the team's last game. He played a team-high 30 minutes, illustrating that he appears to be healthy enough to continue playing going forward. Portland shot 53 percent from the field and held the Pelicans to 35 percent shooting from the field. The Trail Blazers will continue their road trip in Houston against the Rockets on Monday.New Orleans saw their two-game win streak come to an end with the loss. Nearly all of the Pelicans' key players struggled to finish on offense. MVP candidate Anthony Davis shot just 3-of-14 from the field to post seven points. While the production came in garbage time, Austin Rivers took advantage of his extra minutes and attacked the wrack, earning 12 trips to the foul line and converting 11 of them to help him finish with 21 points in 33 minutes off the bench. Tyreke Evans (knee) returned from a one-game absence but was largely ineffective in 23 minutes. The Pelicans will go on the road for the second game of a back-to-back set on Sunday, facing the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Charlotte Hornets (8-19) defeated the Utah Jazz (8-20) 104-86 on Saturday.Charlotte has won two straight, overcoming the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday and now the Jazz on the second night of a back-to-back set. While some will point to Lance Stephenson's (groin) absence in the games and argue that the Hornets play better without him, the level of the Hornets' opponent cannot be overlooked. The Sixers and Jazz are young teams. With or without Stephenson, the Hornets should have had this weekend's games circled as projected wins. Kemba Walker scored a game-high 20 points Saturday, and Al Jefferson pitched in a double-double of 19 points and 10 rebounds. However, near the end of the game, Jefferson suffered a mild groin strain, leaving him somewhat questionable going into the Hornets' next game Monday when they host the Denver Nuggets.Utah couldn't get their shots to fall, converting just 39 percent of their field goal attempts and 26 percent of their shots from beyond the arc. With the game turning into a blowout, the Jazz opted to spread the minutes out more amongst the bench players. Rudy Gobert finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. Saturday's loss broke the first two-game win streak the Jazz have been able to put together this season. They'll have another tough game Monday when they finish up their six-game road trip in Memphis against the Grizzlies.

												The Atlanta Hawks (19-7) defeated the Houston Rockets (19-7) 104-97 on Saturday.Atlanta extended their win streak to three games. Kyle Korver led the way on offense with a game-high 22 points in 38 minutes. Dennis Schroder got a second straight spot start at point guard with Jeff Teague (hamstring) out again. Schroder put up eight points, six rebounds and six assists in 30 minutes. The Hawks shot 51 percent from the field while holding the Rockets to 40 percent shooting from the field. Atlanta will finish up their road trip on Monday against the Dallas Mavericks.Houston has dropped two straight as they work to find a balance following Dwight Howard's return to action. Howard has been playing great, but after the Rockets found great success during his absence, there can be an adjustment period when working a high-usage player like Howard back into the groove. Harden scored 18 points to go with a career-high 14 assists in 39 minutes. The Rockets will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (20-8) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (17-11) 99-93 on Saturday.Dallas welcomed Rajon Rondo to the team with a victory. Rondo was acquired by the Mavericks in a five-player trade with the Boston Celtics on Thursday. He moved directly into the starting lineup, putting up six points, seven rebounds, nine assists and two steals in 34 minutes. Monta Ellis capitalized on Rondo's passing to score a game-high 38 points. The Mavericks have won three straight games and will try to extend their streak when they host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday.San Antonio has lost four straight games during a stretch of their schedule that's seen them face off against the Western Conference's elite teams (Trail Blazers twice, Grizzlies and Mavericks). Coming into Saturday's game, the Spurs played two triple-overtime games in a row that saw some of their veteran players, like Tim Duncan, play over 40 minutes in each game. So, even without Tony Parker (hamstring) and Kawhi Leonard (hand) available to play, the Spurs decided to rest Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Danny Green, putting them behind the eight ball trying to win Saturday. San Antonio will try to stop the bleeding when they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.

Ty Lawson led the way with 15 points and 10 assists for a double-double. Danilo Gallinari got in on the fun off the bench, scoring a team-high 19 points in 28 minutes. Both teams struggled to put the ball in the basket. Denver shot just 37 percent from the field, but they gained an advantage by holding the Pacers to an even worse 31 percent shooting. Indiana has lost two straight and ten of their last 11 games. They had just three players score in double figures Saturday, with David West scoring a team-high 19 points to go along with ten rebounds and five assists. Starting center Roy Hibbert continues to struggle in his return from a sprained ankle. He got into foul trouble Saturday that limited him to zero points and five rebounds in 24 minutes. The Pacers will finish their road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (19-8) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (14-14) 106-102 on Saturday.Los Angeles has won three of their last four games. Chris Paul paced the team with a game-high 27 points and nine assists. DeAndre Jordan continued his impressive work on the boards, pulling down 16 rebounds, and Blake Griffin and J.J. Redick joined Paul in scoring over 20 points. The Clippers have a tough stretch of their schedule coming up with the Spurs, Hawks, Warriors and Raptors all on this week's docket.Even with the loss, Milwaukee finished their four-game Western Conference road trip 2-2, a job well done by the developing squad. In the three games since Jabari Parker went down with a season-ending ACL injury, coach Jason Kidd has cut the umbilical cord they had on Giannis Antetokounmpo. He played over 37 minutes for the second straight game Saturday, which is ten more minutes than his season average of 27 minutes per game. Larry Sanders returned to the starting lineup after sitting out Thursday's game on a league mandated one-game suspension.

												The Utah Jazz (8-19) defeated the Orlando Magic (10-19) 101-94 on Friday.Utah is on a two-game win streak, the first time they've won back-to-back games this season. Derrick Favors appears to be back to full health following the ankle injury that sidelined him for two games earlier this week. He put up a team-high 23 points and 10 rebounds in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward got into the action with 20 points and six assists in 36 minutes. Orlando has lost three straight and five of their last six games. They shot decent from the field, converting 45 percent of their shots, but the Magic committed a lot of fouls, putting the Jazz at the charity stripe for 19 free points on 24 attempts. Tobias Harris finished with a game-high 24 points, and Evan Fournier backed his play with 21 points. The Jazz will continue their road trip in Charlotte on Saturday against the Hornets. Orlando will stay home to host the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (7-19) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (2-23) 109-91 on Friday.Charlotte ended their four-game losing streak with the win. Kemba Walker led the way with a game-high 30 points in 38 minutes. Al Jefferson put up a double-double of 20 points and 12 rebounds. The Hornets were playing without starting shooting guard Lance Stephenson. He is dealing with a pelvic injury that will keep him out of Saturday's game against the Utah Jazz as well.Philadelphia has lost five straight games. On the bright side of things, the Sixers shot 45 percent from the field, 46 percent from beyond the arc and 88 percent from the free-throw line. However, as has been the case all season for the Sixers, they coughed up too many turnovers, giving up 34 easy points off of 24 turnovers. Coach Brett Brown opted to use a 10-man rotation that gave every player on Philadelphia at least 11 minutes of action. Alexey Shved was traded to the Houston Rockets on Friday as part of a three-team trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Sixers received back a second-round pick and Ronny Turiaf's contract. Philadelphia will start a seven-game road trip on Sunday against the Orlando Magic.

												The Toronto Raptors (21-6) defeated the Detroit Pistons (5-22) 110-100 on Friday. Toronto has won five straight games, knocking down most of the Eastern Conference's lottery contingent over the last week. Six players scored in double figures for the Raptors. Jonas Valanciunas scored a team-high 17 points and pulled down seven rebounds. They continue to win even without DeMar DeRozan (adductor) in the lineup, maintaining their seat atop the Eastern Conference standings, but a scary injury happened to Landry Fields in Friday's game. Fields took a bad fall and had his head hit the court, causing him to suffer a cut in his head that required eight stitches. Considering the serious potential of the situation, Fields came out OK, even passing a concussion test. The Raptors will play the New York Knicks on Sunday. Detroit has lost their last three games, as they were navigating a murder's row of the Clippers, Mavericks and Raptors.

With Robin Lopez out for the next 1-2 months with a broken right hand, the Trail Blazers appear as though they'll use a match-up based approach to determing who they start in Lopez's absence from game to game. They started Thomas Robinson in Wednesday's 104-97 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, but Joel Freeland was moved into the starting lineup Friday. Freeland put up eight points and six rebounds in 21 minutes. Thomas Robinson played 27 minutes off the bench but only provided two points and six rebounds.

Tim Duncan scored a team-high 32 points and pulled down 10 rebounds in 43 minutes. Danny Green pitched in a double-double of 27 points and 10 rebounds in 44 minutes.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (13-14) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (8-18) 104-103 on Friday.Oklahoma City made their way quickly back into the win column after losing 114-109 to the Golden State Warriors on Thursday. Kevin Durant sat out the game as a precautionary measure. He sprained his ankle in Thursday's game, and while Durant wanted to play, the Thunder don't want him trying to compensate for his sprained ankle, putting himself at risk of reinjuring his surgically repaired foot. Russell Westbrook and Reggie Jackson carried the weight for the Thunder. Westbrook scored a game-high 31 points, and Jackson had 25 points off the bench. Oklahoma City will return home to host the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday.Los Angeles has dropped two straight. Though Kobe Bryant scored just nine points in 35 minutes, the Lakers matched up well with the Thunder in nearly every relevant statistical category. Where the Thunder gained an advantage was at the free-throw line. Los Angeles sent the Thunder to the charity stripe 29 times, with the Thunder converting 22 of their attempts.

												The Bulls (16-9) held on to defeat the Knicks (5-23) at the United Center on Thursday.Chicago jumped out to a 10-point first quarter lead but let the Knicks crawl back into the game in the third quarter. The lead was whittled to just one with one minute remaining, but a Pau Gasol layup put Chicago up three, and the Knicks were unable to get any closer, while Chicago salted the game away at the line.The Bulls got 35 points, five rebounds, seven assists and four steals from Jimmy Butler, who played 45 minutes. Playing without Derrick Rose, Chicago turned to Kirk Hinrich, who added eight points. Pau Gasol added 20 points, and Nikola Mirotic contributed 13 off the bench. Aaron Brooks had 18 points, including a trio of three-pointers. Chicago shot 45.3 percent from the field and knocked down 12 threes. New York, which was without Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith, got contributions from a number of starters, including 16 points, six rebounds and four blocks from Amar’e Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway, Jr. led the team with 23 points, while Cole Aldrich and Jose Calderon added 13 points and 12 points, respectively. Aldrich also had 10 rebounds 26 minutes. The Knicks shot 46.3 percent from the field and attempted only nine three-ponters, hitting six. They out-rebounded Chicago 41-32 but committed 16 turnovers, compared to the Bulls’ 11.Up next, the Bulls travel to Memphis to take on the red-hot Grizzlies on Friday. New York returns home to host the Suns on Saturday.

												The Pelicans (13-12) got 30 points and 14 rebounds from Anthony Davis and knocked off the Rockets (19-6) 99-90 in Houston on Thursday.Davis shot 10-of-17 from the field and 10-of-12 from the line and added blocks to go with only one turnover in 41 minutes. Jrue Holiday added 16 points for New Orleans, while Austin Rivers, starting in place of Tyreke Evans, finished with 10 points and six assists. Ryan Anderson added 15 points off the bench, and Dante Cunningham contributed 11 (6-10 FG).The Pelicans trailed entering the fourth quarter but outscored Houston 34-22 in the final period.The Rockets were led by 17 points and 13 rebounds from Dwight Howard in his second game back from a knee injury. James Harden added 21 points but shot a miserable 8-of-23 from the field. He did add five assists and seven rebounds, however. Trevor Ariza finished with 10 points (4-12 FG) and Patrick Beverley and Donatas Motiejunas each contributed nine. The Rockets shot a paltry 38.4 percent from the floor and just 6-of-25 from beyond the arc. They outscored New Orleans 48-38 in the paint but were out-rebounded by a two-board margin, an unusual statistic from one of the league’s better rebounding teams.Up next, the Rockets host the Hawks on Saturday. New Orleans returns home to play host to Portland, also on Saturday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (14-13) defeated the Sacramento Kings (11-15) 108-107 on Thursday.Milwaukee played a wild card, starting rookie Johnny O'Bryant at power forward in just the second game of his career. O'Bryant earned the start with Larry Sanders sitting out with a one-game suspension, and with Jabari Parker (knee) recently ruled out for the season following a the suffering of a torn ACL in Monday's win over the Phoenix Suns. O'Bryant scored six points in 17 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo was questionable to play after he suffered a sprained ankle in Wednesday's loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, but his ankle appears to be no issue as he played 37 minutes, which far exceeds the 27 minutes per game he's averaged this season. Jared Dudley moved back to a bench role but still put up 19 points in 33 minutes.Sacramento got DeMarcus Cousins back from a ten-game absence due to a bout with viral meningitis. While it was expected that Cousins' minutes may be limited, the Kings let him play his usual compliment of 30-plus minutes, in which time Cousins put up a game-high 27 points to go with 11 rebounds and five assists. Though the team installed Ty Corbin as their new head coach this week, they have not made any significant changes to their rotation through Corbin's first two games. Milwaukee will wrap up their four-game road trip Saturday in Los Angeles against the Clippers. Sacramento has dropped five straight games, but they'll have a good chance at breaking that streak when they host the Lakers on Sunday.

												The Golden State Warriors (22-3) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (12-14) 114-109 on Thursday. Golden State had their 16-game win streak end in Tuesday's 105-98 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, but they quickly got back in the win column. Stephen Curry scored a game-high 34 points and also had nine assists and four steals in 42 minutes. The Warriors shot 51 percent from the field and recorded 32 assists, compared to the Thunder's 17 assists. Golden state has the weekend off before they host the Sacramento Kings on Monday. Oklahoma City had their seven-game win streak snapped, and they lost Kevin Durant to a sprained ankle after the MVP rolled his ankle coming down on Maurice Speights' foot. Durant underwent X-rays that came back negative, and the sprain was graded as being mild, but he was held out of the second half as a precaution. Even in just 19 minutes of action Thursday, Durant scored 30 points on 10-of-13 shooting from the field. Russell Westbrook finished with a team-high 33 points and eight assists in 40 minutes. It's possible the Thunder could continue to take the cautious route Friday and hold Durant out of their game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Phoenix Suns (13-14) got the job done on the road against the Charlotte Hornets (6-19) 111-106 on Wednesday.Phoenix came into this one looking to grab a much-needed win, and they did just that. It wasn't easy, but thanks to some solid guard play, they left Charlotte with a win. Goran Dragic (back) returned from a two-game absence, leading the way with 20 points (8-17 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 3-3 FT), eight assists, three rebounds and one steal in 37 minutes. Isaiah Thomas once again excelled in his role off the bench, scoring 23 points (7-13 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 6-10 FT) to go with three assists and three rebounds. In total, the Suns had six players score in double figures, with Gerald Green posting 16 off the bench, and Eric Bledsoe scoring 15 points in 39 minutes. The Suns outscored the Hornets 28-19 in the fourth quarter, which ended up being the difference.The Hornets are searching for answers right now, and with trade rumors flying about Lance Stephenson, he put up another mediocre game. Stephenson scored just seven points (3-8 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-1 FT) to go with four rebounds and two assists in only 25 minutes. It was the combo of Al Jefferson (28 points and 10 rebounds) and Kemba Walker (27 points and seven assists) that led the way, but they still fell short.

												The Atlanta Hawks (18-7) went on the road and made a statement, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers (14-10) 127-98 on Wednesday.Atlanta came into this game as one of the hottest teams in the NBA, and it showed on Wednesday, as they put on a show while dominating LeBron James and the Cavaliers. What made this even more impressive is that the team was without Jeff Teague (hamstring), so Dennis Schroder earned the start. Schroder did a nice job running the offense, and in just 22 minutes, he had 10 points (4-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT), with 10 assists. The most surprising showing though, had to be from Shelvin Mack off the bench, who racked up 23 minutes and scored an impressive 24 points (7-8 FG, 6-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT), with three assists and two rebounds. Atlanta showed up across the board, with eight players scoring at least nine points in an impressive win.For the Cavaliers, it was just a struggle. James scored well, with 21 points (8-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 5-7 FT), but had only three rebounds, two assists and two steals. It was a pretty quiet game for the superstar. Dion Waiters had a nice night off the bench, scoring 21 points (9-18 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) to go with four assists and three rebounds in 27 minutes. Kevin Love was slowed by an illness, but played through it to get a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds. No other Cavaliers player topped 10 points.

												The Orlando Magic (10-18) dropped a tough one against the Boston Celtics (9-14) 109-92 on Wednesday.Despite getting double-digit scoring from five players on Wednesday, the Magic were outdone by the Celtics in the second half, and went on to lose by 17. Nikola Vucevic was the leading man for the Magic, as he scored 18 points (9-19 FG) and tacked on 13 rebounds as well. Evan Fournier and Channing Frye each chipped in 13 points, and Tobias Harris scored 17, but the team's struggles from the outside were too much to overcome. They shot just 5-19 from three-point land.For the Celtics, Rajon Rondo led the way with a strong performance, scoring 13 points (6-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt) to go with 15 assists and seven rebounds. While he didn't lead the team in scoring, he's the man who fuels the entire offense. Brandon Bass had a very nice game off the bench, scoring 18 points (6-10 FG, 6-6 FT), while both Jared Sullinger and Jeff Green chipped in 16 points each. The Celtics have some impressive young talent, but they've lacked consistency from game to game.

												The Dallas Mavericks (19-8) went on the road and knocked off the Detroit Pistons (5-21) 117-106 on Wednesday. The Mavericks have a knack for defeating the teams who they're supposed to defeat, and that showed once again on Wednesday, with another double-digit victory. The ""big four"" for the Mavericks all chipped in by doing their part, as Chandler Parsons had a huge game, scoring 32 points (10-17 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 8-9 FT) to go with seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Monta Ellis was at it again, scoring 25 points (11-20 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT), with eight assists, while Dirk Nowitzki posted a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Tyson Chandler fell just short of his own double-double, posting 16 points and nine rebounds.The Pistons gave the game away at the foul line, putting the Mavericks at the charity stripe for 27 easy points on 35 free throw attempts. The only starter who played over 28 minutes was Andre Drummond (41). The bench saw four players go over 20 minutes, showing that the Pistons are trying to find any lineup that can produce consistently. Drummond put up a stellar line, scoring 19 points (9-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-6 FT) to go with 24 rebounds, four steals, three blocks and an assist. Aside from that though, no one lit up the box score, and both Brandon Jennings and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope struggled shooting the ball on Wednesday.

												The Utah Jazz (7-19) took down the Miami Heat (12-14) 105-87 on Wednesday.The Jazz saw multiple players step up in this game to help get the win, including Gordon Hayward putting up 29 points (9-13 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 7-7 FT), seven assists and six rebound. While Hayward was huge, Enes Kanter (18 points), Alec Burks (12 points) and Derrick Favors (11 points) all chipped in nicely to help out as well. Dante Exum is another name to watch, as he's getting some minutes off the bench, and the rookie turned 24 minutes into 10 points (4-5 FG, 2-3 3Pt), three assists and two rebounds. He stepped up when his number was called, and coach Quin Snyder has said he wants the rookie to be more aggressive.It was an interesting night for the Heat, as they not only were without Chris Bosh (calf) and Josh McRoberts (knee), but they inserted Chris Andersen into the starting lineup for the first time since he joined the Heat in the 2012-13 season. What made it even more interesting was that two of their starters, Norris Cole and Justin Hamilton, played only 17 and 12 minutes, as coach Erik Spoelstra opted to use his bench the majority of the game. When all was said and done, it was basically the Dwyane Wade show, as he scored an incredible 42 points (12-19 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 16-21 FT) to go with four rebounds and three assists. Wade and Mario Chalmers (13 points on 3-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) were the only Heat players to score double figures.

												The Toronto Raptors (20-6) knocked off the Brooklyn Nets (10-14) 105-89 on Wednesday.The Nets were once again without Brook Lopez (back), giving Mason Plumlee another start at center. Lopez is expected to be out until at least Sunday. Kevin Garnett was also held out to rest his foot injury on the second night of a back-to-back, which sent Mirza Teletovic into the starting lineup. Both Plumlee and Teletovic got plenty of work, and both produced nicely. Plumlee played 37 minutes, scoring 23 points (9-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-11 FT) to go with eight rebounds, two assists and two blocks, while Teletovic scored 14 points (5-10 FG, 4-8 3Pt) to go with three rebounds and two assists in 21 minutes. Joe Johnson had a solid night as well, scoring 17 points (8-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 0-3 FT) to go with eight rebounds, three assists and one steal in 38 minutes.The Raptors rallied in the fourth, outscoring the Nets 29-16 to run away with the game. They were led by a big night from Kyle Lowry, who had 20 points (7-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) to go with 12 assists, three rebounds and two steals in 32 minutes. Jonas Valanciunas also posted a double-double, posting 16 points (6-7 FG, 4-4 FT) and 10 rebounds in 28 minutes. It was a well-rounded effort for the Raptors, as six players scored in double figures, with three of those players coming off the bench (Patrick Patterson, Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams). The win streak is now up to four in a row for Toronto, and they'll look to keep it going against the Detroit Pistons on Friday night.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (21-4) grabbed an impressive road victory 117-116 in triple-overtime against the San Antonio Spurs (17-9) on Wednesday.Memphis battled through three overtimes on the road without defensive stopper Tony Allen (eye). It was a great team effort, as six players scored in double figures, including Vince Carter, who scored 18 points in 41 minutes off the bench, and Kosta Koufos, who posted 16 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph and Mike Conley led the charge. Gasol posted 26 points with nine rebounds and hit a game-tying three-pointer as time expired at the end of regulation. Randolph had an incredible double-double of 21 points and 21 reobounds, while Conley fell just short of a triple-double with 14 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. The Grizzlies won't get much rest, as they'll take on the Chicago Bulls on Friday.The Spurs were without both Kawhi Leonard (hand) and Tony Parker (hamstring) on Wednesday. They asked for big minutes out of the likes of Danny Green (52 minutes), Tim Duncan (48 minutes), Marco Belinelli (43 minutes), Manu Ginobili (41 minutes), Boris Diaw (39 minutes) and Cory Joseph (38 minutes). Green led the team in scoring with 25 points (9-17 FG, 7-13 3Pt) to go with seven rebounds, five blocks, three assists and two steals. Duncan and Diaw both posted impressive double-doubles, as Duncan scored 23 points (9-22 FG, 5-15 FT) with 16 rebounds, and Diaw had 17 points (5-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 4-4 Ft) with 13 rebounds. Ginobili found himself just short of a triple-double, scoring 21 points (7-20 FG, 4-9 3Pt, 3-7 FT), with eight assists and eight rebounds. The Spurs struggled from the free-throw line, hitting just 48 percent of their shots there.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (20-6) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (13-13) 104-97 on Wednesday. Portland is on a three-game win streak, but Wednesday's win came with a special meaning for the Blazers as it was the first game they've played this season without Robin Lopez. Lopez is expected to miss up to two months with a broken right hand. LaMarcus Aldridge shifted over to center so that Thomas Robinson could step into the starting lineup at power forward. Robinson put up 15 points and 16 rebounds in 29 minutes. Aldridge put up a 23-point, 15-rebound double-double, and Damian Lillard scored a game-high 29 points.Milwaukee saw their two-game win streak snapped, and they too were playing without one of their key starters due to injury. Jabari Parker suffered torn ACL in his left knee in Monday's 96-94 win over the Phoenix Suns and will miss the rest of the season. To make matters worse, Giannis Antetokounmpo sprained his left ankle after 18 minutes of action and was not able to continue. The severity of the injury was not available after the game. Jared Dudley moved into the starting lineup with Parker out, and Brandon Knight finished with a team-high 24 points in 33 minutes.Portland will embark on a four-game road trip that begins in San Antonio on Friday against the Spurs. Milwaukee will continue their road trip in Sacramento on Thursday against the Kings.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (14-9) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (6-18) 97-88 on Monday.Cleveland ended their two-game losing streak with the win. LeBron James led the way for the Cavs with a double-double of a game-high 27 points and 13 assists. Kevin Love chipped in a double-double of his own, putting up 22 points and 18 rebounds. Mike Miller sat out a sixth straight game with concussion symptoms. Dion Waiters (abdomen) and Matthew Delladova (illness) were able to play after dealing with ailments over the weekend. Charlotte got off to a horrible start in the first quarter, beginning the game on an 0-21 stretch in which the Hornets allowed 21 points to the Cavaliers, while scoring none of their own. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist reclaimed his spot as the starting small forward, pushing Gerald Henderson back to a bench role and Lance Stephenson back to shooting guard. Kemba Walker led the fight back for the Hornets, finishing with a team-high 24 points, but it was the play of Charlotte's bench that allowed them to end the game respectably.The Cavaliers will host the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, while the Hornets will also play Wednesday, hosting the Phoenix Suns.

												The Indiana Pacers (8-17) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (8-17) 110-91 on Monday. Indiana broke their eight-game losing streak with the win. They were wading through one of the more difficult stretches of their schedule, so the prolonged losing streak wasn't entirely surprising, and neither was the fact that they were able to snap their losing streak against the Lakers. Indiana's defense is nothing to write home about, but the Lakers shot just 33 percent from the field and were out-rebounded 53-38, putting the game out their reach in more than one telling category. C.J. Miles (knee) returned to action and scored 20 points off the bench, while Rodney Stuckey had one of his Blue Moon great performances, approaching a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.Los Angeles' recent success and three-game winning streak came to a brutal end. After passing Michael Jordan for third on the all-time scoring list in Sunday's game, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers were coming down from an emotional milestone game which put them at risk of coming into Monday's back-to-back without the energy to put up a proper fight. Bryant chucked his way to 21 points, shooting 8-of-26 from the field to take the wind out of the Lakers' sails.Indiana will embark on a three-game road trip that starts Wednesday in Los Angeles against the Clippers. The Lakers will have three days off before hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.

												The Boston Celtics (8-14) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (2-22) 105-87 on Monday.Boston snapped their three-game losing streak with the win. Starting center Tyler Zeller picked up two early fouls, limiting his action, but backup Kelly Olynyk filled in exceedingly well off the bench, putting up a game-high 30 points to go with nine rebounds and two blocks. Rajon Rondo played just 24 minutes, as coach Brad Stevens has turned away from Rondo at times in recent games, an interesting development when taken in the context of the Celtics' roster on a given night, as it appears Stevens simply doesn't see Rondo as capable of leading the team to a win against certain matchups.Philadelphia has dropped four straight games. They couldn't get much to work offensively Monday. As a team, the Sixers shot 36 percent from the field and 14 percent from beyond the arc. Furkan Aldemir signed a four-year deal with the team Sunday and made his debut Monday, putting up two points and two rebounds in 10 minutes off the bench. Tony Wroten led the Sixers in minutes played with 30 off the bench but did not score and recorded just four rebounds and one assist.Boston will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. The Sixers have three days off before they'll host the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (17-7) defeated the Chicago Bulls (15-9) 93-86 on Monday.Atlanta got back in the win column as quickly as possible after dropping their last game to the Orlando Magic 100-99 on Saturday, the only game they've lost in their last 11 contests. Al Horford continues to break through the rust coming off of missing most of last season following suregery to repair a torn pectoral, and he showed off his passing skills Monday, putting up 21 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Atlanta shot just 44 percent from the field, but to overcome that, they limited the Bulls to an even worse 38 percent shooting from the field.Chicago was on a three-game winning streak before the loss. Joakim Noah sat out a fourth straight game while he lets his sprained ankle heal completely. His fill-in Taj Gibson recorded a double-double, scoring 15 points and pulling down 17 rebounds.

												The Toronto Raptors (19-6) defeated the Orlando Magic (10-17) 95-82 on Monday.Toronto is on a three-game win streak. Louis Williams led the way for them Monday, putting up a game-high 18 points off the bench. All 10 players that the Raptors used in their rotation received 20 or more minutes, and Kyle Lowry was the only player to receive over 30 minutes of run. Lowry finished with 17 points and eight assists. Orlando has lost three of their last four games, as they were playing through a stretch that saw them facing off against the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Realistically, coming out with one win while facing the Hawks (twice), Wizards and Raptors over a four-game stretch, should be considered an accomplishment. Nikola Vucevic played 35 minutes in his second game back from a lower back injury. Tobias Harris paced the team with 18 points.Toronto will host the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (13-12) defeated the Phoenix Suns (12-14) 96-94 on Monday. Milwaukee has won two straight over Western Conference teams whom are expected to fight for playoff spots this season. The Bucks lost Jabari Parker to a sprained left knee during the contest. Parker will undergo examination to determine the severity of the injury, but when reviewing the tape, it appears Parker may be forced to sit out for at least a few games. Milwaukee used their deep bench to gain an advantage on the thin Suns, with four of the Bucks' bench players finishing in double digits. Starting point guard Brandon Knight scored a team-high 20 points to lead the way. Phoenix is careening downhill with a six-game losing streak. They moved Alex Len into the starting center spot with Miles Plumlee moving to a bench role. Len fouled out, but put up six points, six rebounds and three blocks in 19 minutes. Goran Dragic missed a second straight game with a lower back injury, giving Gerald Green another spot start at shooting guard. Green finished with 12 points and eight rebounds in 40 minutes but shot just 3-of-18 from the field.Milwaukee has three games left on their road trip. They'll take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday. Phoenix's schedule relaxes over their next couple games, starting with Wednesday's game in Charlotte against the Hornets.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (19-6) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (17-8) 108-95 on Monday. Portland has won two straight games, taking Monday's win on the back of LaMarcus Aldridge's double-double of 23 points and 14 rebounds. Damian Lillard also recorded a double-double of 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Starting center Robin Lopez suffered a broken hand in the game and is expected to be sidelined for a considerable amount of time. San Antonio has lost three of their last five, and surprisingly, the team continues to rest several of their key players despite losing games. Tim Duncan, Tiago Splitter and Manu Ginobili all sat out for rest, while Tony Parker missed the game with his lingering hamstring injury. Kawhi Leonard scored a team-high 21 points, and six total players finished in double figures for the Spurs. Portland will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (17-7) defeated the Detroit Pistons (5-20) 113-91 on Monday.Los Angeles stopped their two-game losing streak with the win. The Clippers used every available player they had in the blowout, and six of their players finished in double digits. DeAndre Jordan had an impressive double-double of 16 points and 15 rebounds, while the Clippers shot 54 percent from the field and 50 percent from beyond the arc as a team. Jordan Farmar led the bench with 15 points and five assists. His shot was dropping from everywhere Monday.Detroit saw their two-game win streak come to an end with the loss. Jodie Meeks tried his best to keep the Pistons in the game, scoring a game-high 20 points off the bench in just his third game of the season. Detroit shot 42 percent from the floor and 30 percent from beyond the arc, but their biggest issue against the Clippers was allowing 27 easy points on 17 turnovers. Los Angeles will host another struggling Eastern Conference team on Wednesday when the Indiana Pacers come into town. Detroit will return home to host the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (21-2) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (11-12) 128-122 in overtime on Sunday.Golden State has won 16 straight games, and they continue to win despite playing the last three games without starting center Andrew Bogut, whom remains questionable going into this week's games with knee tendinitis and an illness. Stephen Curry carried the Warriors with 34 point Sunday, while three of their bench players finished in double figures to help make up for some of the lack of scoring out of the team's starters. Golden State shot 51 percent from the field and 46 percent from beyond the arc to seal the win. The Warriors will wrap up their three-game road trip in a battle of titans on Tuesday when they visit Memphis to take on the Grizzlies. New Orleans lost Anthony Davis to a chest injury in Friday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers but were still able to come away with a 119-114 win on the back of Tyreke Evans' 31 points. With Davis out again Sunday, Evans once again stepped up, putting up 34 points and eight rebounds in 41 minutes. Jrue Holiday also scored 30 points and was a pest on defense with five steals. Ryan Anderson filled in as the starting power forward and finished with 15 points. The Pelicans have won three of their last five games, and more importantly, they've been more competitive over the last week against elite teams thanks to the addition of Dante Cunningham as a defensive player off their bench at small forward. Their next game is at home Tuesday against the Utah Jazz.

												The Chicago Bulls (15-8) defeated the Miami Heat (11-13) 93-75 on Sunday.Chicago has won four of their last five games. Mike Dunleavy took a rare lead on offense Sunday, finishing with a game-high 22 points on an efficient 8-of-11 shooting from the field. Joakim Noah sat out a third straight game to rest his sprained ankle, giving Taj Gibson another spot start. Gibson finished with 15 points and nine rebounds in 38 minutes. The Bulls will continue their two-game road trip in Atlanta on Monday against the Hawks.Miami has lost six of their last eight games, and Sunday they were without both Chris Bosh (calf) and Josh McRoberts (knee), putting them behind the eight ball trying to fight for a win without their starting frontcourt. With Bosh out, the Heat struggled to get anything working on offense and shot a woeful 35 percent from the field and 18 percent from beyond the arc. Miami will go on the road Tuesday to face the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Washington Wizards (17-6) defeated the Utah Jazz (6-18) 93-84 on Sunday.Washington has taken advantage of a relatively easy part of their schedule to win four straight and eight of their last nine. Bradley Beal has started to break through his early-season rust and scored the game-high in points for the second straight game, finishing with 22 points Sunday. The Wizards help the Jazz to 39 percent shooting while converting 49 percent of their own shots from the field to secure the win.Utah has lost 11 of their last 12 games. They were without Derrick Favors (ankle) on Sunday, but Favors is travelling with the team on their six-game road trip, indicating that he could return sooner than later. Sophomore center Rudy Gobert earned the first start of his career in Favors' absence. Gobert put up seven points, nine rebounds and three blocks in 31 minutes. At 7-1, he has the tools to be one of the best shot blockers in the league if given the minutes. The Jazz continue their road trip in New Orleans on Tuesday against the Pelicans.

												The San Antonio Spurs (17-7) defeated the Denver Nuggets (10-14) 99-91 on Sunday. San Antonio has lost two of their last four games, with both recent losses coming against non-playoff teams, the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers. Sunday's win over the Nuggets was accomplished with Tony Parker sitting out with a lingering hamstring issue that has caused him to miss four of the last five games. Kawhi Leonard (hand) returned from a two-game absence to record a team-high 18 points in 37 minutes. The Spurs forced the Nuggets into 21 turnovers that resulted in 30 easy points for the Spurs, using the Nuggets' inability to protect the ball to gain an advantage. San Antonio will conclude their two-game road trip against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.Denver has lost six of their last seven games. While they are traversing a rather difficult part of their schedule, the Nuggets' regression over the last two weeks seems more of a regression to the mean than merely a poor stretch. Kenneth Faried sat out the game with an ankle injury, and the team continues to ride the hot hand from game to game, showing little faith in most of their players to account for a poor start and make adjustments. Coach Brian Shaw tends to yank anyone he deems to be underperforming in favor of throwing his bench players into the fray in wild attempts to find an elixir for their problems within a given game. Arron Afflalo scored a game-high 31 points to keep them in Sunday's game, but Afflalo also committed six of the turnovers that proved to be their undoing. The Nuggets will host the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (8-16) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-18) 100-94 on Sunday. Los Angeles has strung together three straight wins with their new starting lineup. Ironically enough, most of their success can be pointed to the improved play of their bench since Jeremy Lin and Carlos Boozer were moved into reserve roles. Taking Boozer and Lin out of the starting lineup allows Kobe Bryant to operate unecumbered as the loan dominant offensive player in the starting lineup while giving Lin and Boozer possessions off the bench that don't require Bryant to force his touches. Boozer led the Lakers on Sunday with a bygone double-double of 22 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes. The Lakers will look to continue their recent success when they take on the woeful Indiana Pacers on Monday.Bryant's 26 points vaulted him over Michael Jordan in career points to land at third all-time for the NBA scoring record.Minnesota has lost two straight games, but wins and losses are no longer the focus of the Timberwolves' season as president Flip Saunders told the media this week that the team's focus is now on rebuilding for the future, a path Saunders did not plan to walk down this season. However, with Ricky Rubio (ankle), Kevin Martin (wrist) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) all expected to miss as much as another month of action, Minnesota's hopes of competing for a playoff spot this season were dashed. They'll embark on a two-game road trip Tuesday in Washington against the Wizards.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (11-13) defeated the Phoenix Suns (12-13) 112-88 on Sunday.Oklahoma City has won six straight games, making a defining run following the return of their stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to the lineup two weeks ago. Their win over the Suns was a drubbing that allowed the Thunder to play their starters limited minutes. Oklahoma City shot 48 percent from the field, but where they truly dominated the game was on the glass, collecting 63 rebounds compared to the Suns' 40 rebounds. The Suns also couldn't keep the Thunder off the free-throw line, allowing them to put up 30 free points at the charity stripe. Oklahoma City will start a three-game road trip in Sacramento on Tuesday against the Kings. Phoenix has dropped five straight games and appear to be in a tailspin, but that could correct itself as they embark on an Eastern Conference road trip this week that could allow them to get back in the win column. While the Suns had Isaiah Thomas return to action Friday in their 105-103 loss to the Detroit Pistons, the team also played without Goran Dragic on Sunday, as he was forced to sit out with a lower-back strain. Gerald Green earned the spot start in Dragic's absence and finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes. Phoenix will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday.

												The Toronto Raptors (18-6) defeated the New York Knicks (5-21) 95-90 in overtime on Sunday.Toronto is on a two-game win streak and have taken three of their last four games, showing up spectacularly well despite being without DeMar DeRozan (adductor) for what is expected to be at least another couple weeks. Landry Fields has started the last three games in DeRozan's absence, but it's been the increased workloads of Kyle Lowry and Louis Williams that has carried the Raptors. Terrence Ross even got in on the fun Sunday, putting up a team-high 22 points. The Raptors shot 46 percent from the field and 38 percent from beyond the arc to secure the win. They'll host the Orlando Magic on Monday.New York has lost 11 of their last 12 games, and the bleakness will be hard for them to overcome anytime soon as they're currently trudging through a difficult part of their schedule. Playing without Iman Shumpert (shoulder) and J.R. Smith (plantar fascitis) on Sunday, the Knicks struggled, shooting just 37 percent from the field and 31 percent from beyond the arc. Carmelo Anthony scored a game-high 34 points. The Knicks will host the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday.

												The Golden Warriors (20-2) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (17-8) 105-98 on Saturday.Golden State has won 15 straight games, and in their last two games, they've done it without starting center Andrew Bogut who has been sidelined with tendinitis in his knee. David Lee (hamstring) is nearing a return but has yet to be cleared to return to action, and even when Lee does return, there doesn't seem to be more than a marginal role off off the bench available to him. Stephen Curry led the way with a game-high 29 points Saturday, and he was helped by Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, who both also finished with 20-plus points. Golden State is playing a back-to-back set. They'll continue their road trip Sunday in New Orleans against the Pelicans. Bogut had fluid drained from his knee and will sit out Sunday.Dallas is playing through a relatively tough part of their schedule at the moment, and while they've been able to successfully dispatch middling teams, the Mavericks haven't been able to overcome most of the other title-contending teams they've faced, recently dropping games to the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies. As a result they're just 2-3 over their last five games. Chandler Parsons suffered a back injury Tuesday but then played through the injury Wednesday. Even with two days off, he was rested Saturday, and Richard Jefferson was given the spot start at small forward in Parsons' absence. Jameer Nelson returned after a one-game absence with a shoulder injury. Nelson returned to the starting lineup and played 28 minutes. Dallas has two days off before going on the road to face the New York Knicks.

												The Brooklyn Nets (10-12) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (6-17) 114-87 on Saturday.Brooklyn has won two straight, and they earned Saturday's win without several of their frontcourt players. Brook Lopez remains out indefinitely with a lower back injury, while Kevin Garnett sat out to rest his foot on the second night of a back-to-back, and Mirza Teletovic missed a third straight game with a hip pointer. Mason Plumlee played well as the starting center, recording his second straight double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds. Cory Jefferson earned the first start of his career and put 11 points and five rebounds in 23 minutes. Charlotte has lost two straight, and despite the Nets rolling out their third-string frontcourt, Charlotte was unable to capitalize on the opportunity. Brooklyn shot an absurd 58 percent from the field and 70 percent from beyond the arc to decimate the Hornets' defense, while Charlotte shot just 39 percent from the field and 63 percent from the free-throw line. The Nets have two days off before they'll host the Miami Heat on Monday. Charlotte will go on the road to play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (18-6) defeated the Indiana Pacers (7-17) 95-85 on Saturday.Portland stopped the bleeding from their two-game losing streak with the win. Five players finished in double figures with LaMarcus Aldridge scoring a team-high 19 points. C.J. McCollum remains sidelined with a broken finger, but the Trail Blazers are otherwise healthy. This was the final game of their five-game road trip. Portland will return home to host the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.Indiana has lost eight straight games. Though they are traversing one of the rougher parts of their schedule, the depths to which the Pacers have struggled is surprising. Other than Paul George (leg) and George Hill (knee) being out, the team is healthy, but they haven't found their groove yet this season. Roy Hibbert recorded a double-double of 10 points and 10 rebounds, his first double-double in six games. The Pacers shot a woeful 39 percent from the field in Saturday's loss. They'll host the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday, giving them a realistic opportunity to get a new number in the win column.

												The Orlando Magic (10-16) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (16-7) 100-99 on Saturday.The Magic and Hawks were playing a home-and-home set Friday and Saturday. Atlanta took Friday's game 87-81, but Orlando was reinforced by the return of starting center Nikola Vucevic on Saturday to give them a more stout lineup. Vucevic missed six games with a lower back injury, but in his return, he posted 18 points and 11 rebounds in 35 minutes to show that he's back to full health. Orlando snapped a two-game losing streak with the win and have won three of their last five. The Magic will embark on a two-game road trip that begins on Monday against the Toronto Raptors. Atlanta had their nine-game win streak snapped with Saturday's loss. They had trouble getting their shots to fall, finishing shooting just 42 percent from the field and 30 percent from beyond the arc.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (12-12) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (16-7) 111-106 on Saturday.Milwaukee capped their two-game losing streak with the win. The Bucks shot 57 percent from the field and 64 percent from beyond the arc, dissecting the Clippers' defense quite masterfully. Brandon Knight scored a team-high 22 points, and the Bucks had six players finish in double figures. The Bucks have been wading through a tough stretch of their schedule that will continue as they embark on a four-game Western Conference road trip Monday against the Phoenix Suns. Los Angeles has dropped two straight games. Prior to their most recent losses, the Clippers went on a nine-game win streak in what will probably prove to be the easiest stretch of their schedule this season. Confronted with more top-level teams, the Clippers have buckled, and with Spencer Hawes (knee) sitting out Saturday, they lacked depth in the frontcourt, putting an even greater onus on their starting lineup. Chris Douglas-Roberts returned from a 17-game absence with an Achilles injury to play six minutes off the bench. Matt Barnes scored a game-high 26 points, and Chris Paul turned the ball over six times in what was an all-around obtuse game for the Clippers. They'll look to end the protraction of their losing streak when they host the Detroit Pistons on Monday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (19-4) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (2-21) 120-115 in overtime on Saturday.Memphis was trailing the first three quarters, and coach Dave Joerger started extending his rotation to try and find a lineup willing to fight against the 76ers' attack. The Grizzlies waited until the fourth quarter to take the Sixers seriously, but in the fourth, Memphis went on a run to win the quarter 41-29 to tie the game and force overtime. The Grizzlies then continued their takeover in the extra period, winning overtime 11-6 to complete the win. In addition to hitting the game-tying three-pointer to send it to overtime, Mike Conley finished with 36 points in 42 minutes. They have two days off to rest before hosting the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday.Philadelphia has dropped three straight games, but the way the young team played against one of the league's best defenses showed the promise of several of their prospects. Michael Carter-Williams attacked all night, never shying away from playing his game against an opponent that all-but assured the Sixers would take home a loss, collecting his second triple-double of the season (16 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists). Robert Covington attacked the basket off the dribble, challenging the Grizzlies' defense to finish with 24 points, and Hollis Thompson was deadeye from beyond the arc, finishing 5-of-5 on his three-point attempts. The Sixers gave the game away with their turnovers, allowing the Grizzlies to score 29 easy points off of 17 Sixers turnovers. Philadelphia will host the Boston Celtics on Monday.

												The Houston Rockets (18-5) defeated the Denver Nuggets (10-13) 108-96 on Saturday. Houston has won two straight games and six of their last seven. Dwight Howard returned to action Saturday after missing the Rockets' last 11 games with a knee injury. He was supposed to be limited to 24 minutes in the game, but Howard persevered to play 30 minutes and put up a monstrous double-double of 26 points and 13 rebounds. Joining Howard in on the fun was James Harden with a triple-double of 24 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 38 minutes. The Rockets' formidable defense held the Nuggets to just 38 percent shooting from the field. Houston will face the Nuggets again in their next game, going on the road to Denver for their game on Wednesday.Denver has lost four of their last five games as they struggle to find footing during a tough part of their schedule. Kenneth Faried came off the bench for a second straight game, with J.J. Hickson staying in the starting lineup at power forward. Denver matched up well with the Rockets on Saturday, but they simply couldn't hit their shots. Even at the free-throw line, the Nuggets shot just 65 percent. Denver will begin a four-game homestead hosting the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday.

												The Detroit Pistons (5-19) defeated the Sacramento Kings (11-13) 95-90 on Saturday.Detroit has won back-to-back games, both coming on the road. Jodie Meeks made his season debut in Friday's 105-103 win over the Phoenix Suns. Coach Stan Van Gundy has opted to bring Meeks off the bench for his first two games, playing him just over 20 minutes in both contests. Josh Smith led the way for the Pistons on Saturday, putting up 21 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks in 38 minutes. Greg Monroe scored a game-high 24 points off the bench. Sacramento has dropped three straight games, continuing to struggle with DeMarcus Cousins (viral meningitis) out of the lineup. They couldn't get their shots to fall Saturday, shooting just 36 percent from the field and 69 percent from the free-throw line. Carl Landry collected a double-double in 24 minutes off the bench, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Pistons. The Pistons will end their road trip in Los Angeles on Monday against the Clippers. Sacramento will stay home to host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.

												The Bulls (14-8) extended their winning streak to two games, knocking off the Blazers (17-6) in Chicago on Friday.The Bulls withstood a huge first quarter from LaMarcus Aldridge, who scored 21 points on 10-of-12 shooting. Chicago was able to keep him under control the rest of the night, however, as Aldridge finished with 35 points and nine rebounds. Damian Lillard added 35 points of his own, and Wes Matthews had 10 points and four rebounds. Nic Batum struggled, scoring seven points on just 3-of-12 shooting. The Blazers shot 49 percent from the field and 50 percent from three but were out-rebounded 47-37.Derrick Rose paced Chicago with 31 points (14-24 FG) to go with five assists and three rebounds.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (18-4) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (6-16) 113-107 in double overtime Friday.Memphis has a three-game winning streak going. They held the Hornets to just 42 percent shooting from the field Friday, but the Grizzlies also turned the ball over 20 times, giving up 22 easy points off those turnovers, which allowed the Hornets to stay in the game and push the contest to two extra periods. Zach Randolph scored a team-high 20 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for a double-double. Memphis should have an easier night Saturday when they take on the experience-challenged Philadelphia 76ers on the road.Charlotte had their two-game win streak snapped with the loss Friday, but the fact that they've started to compete on a nightly basis is a positive for the Hornets after their prolonged struggle to start the season. Kemba Walker scored a game-high 28 points and was aided by Gary Neal's 25 points off the bench. Al Jefferson nearly recorded a double-double, putting up 16 points and nine rebounds. The Hornets will have a lighter opponent Saturday when they host the Brooklyn Nets, but it'll be interesting to see if they'll have their legs after playing the extra minutes Friday.

												The Toronto Raptors (17-6) defeated the Indiana Pacers (7-16) 106-94 on Friday.Toronto has won four of their last six games as they continue to find ways to win without DeMar DeRozan (adductor) in the lineup. Landry Fields started at small forward for the second straight game, putting up eight points in 21 minutes. Louis Williams scored a game-high 26 points off the bench, continuing to show up with big offensive production most games. DrRozan is expected to miss at least another few weeks. The Raptors will go on the road to face the New York Knicks on Sunday.  Indiana is almost back to full health, excluding Paul George who is out for the season, but since getting David West back eight games ago, they've only won a single game. George Hill returned to practice in a limited capacity Thursday, but he's no savior. He won't turn the tide for the Pacers. If they can't compete with their current lineups, they won't improve much with Hill back. C.J. Miles turned a couple good shooting performances off the bench into a move into the starting lineup Friday, but after just 13 minutes of action, Miles suffered a bruised knee and was removed from the game. Roy Hibbert started off the season performing well on both sides of the court, but since returning from an ankle injury six games ago, Hibbert has been foul prone and generally inept on both sides of the court. It's possible his ankle injury is still hindering his mobility and effectiveness. The Pacers will have a chance to redeem themselves Saturday when they host the Portland Trail Blazers. 											",Memphis,Grizzlies,Charlotte,Hornets,FedExForum,6,16,18,4,5.0,10.0,36.0,78.0,29.0,38.0,47.0,21.0,20.0,6.0,17.0,41.0,98.0,19.0,27.0,49.0,16.0,14.0,Tony Allen,10.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,46,Gerald Henderson,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,36,Zach Randolph,11.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,42,Cody Zeller,6.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,34,Marc Gasol,3.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,19.0,8.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,36,Al Jefferson,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,16.0,7.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,45,Courtney Lee,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,29,Lance Stephenson,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,28,Mike Conley,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,41,Kemba Walker,4.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,28.0,11.0,21.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,48,Kosta Koufos,7.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Tayshaun Prince,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14,Gary Neal,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,25.0,8.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,32,Beno Udrih,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,16,Marvin Williams,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,24,Vince Carter,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,7,Bismack Biyombo,7.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,12,Jon Leuer,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,18,Brian Roberts,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (10-13) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5-17) 111-92 on Friday.Oklahoma City has rattled off five wins in a row, and any concerns about the Thunder being at risk of missing the playoffs due to their slow start to the season have been erased. Kevin Durant remains on a minutes limit, but in the minutes he is playing, Durant has been his typical dominant and aggressive self. Russell Westbrook paced the team Friday, finishing with a game-high 34 points. Steven Adams had his best game of the season, putting up a double-double of 16 points and 11 rebounds in 29 minutes. The Thunder will try to extend their winning streak when they host the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.Minnesota has lost seven of their last eight games. They shocked the world Wednesday when they were able to steal a win from the Portland Trail Blazers 90-82. The Timberwolves continue to try and navigate the season with an injury-depleted roster that is missing three of their starters. Ricky Rubio (ankle), Kevin Martin (wrist) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) are all expected to be out about another month, and Mo Williams hasn't made much progress in his bid to return from back spasms. Andrew Wiggins has scored 18 or more points in three straight games, and he'll have to continue producing if the team wants to have a prayer at collecting wins. They'll get a bit of a reprieve Sunday when they host the beatable Los Angeles Lakers.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (11-11) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (13-9) 119-114 on Friday. New Orleans has won three of their last four games, but there was a bitter taste with Friday's win as Anthony Davis suffered a chest injury that limited him to just seven minutes of action. The extent of the injury was not known immediately following the game. Ryan Anderson earned 41 minutes of run in Davis' absence and tied his career-high with eight made three-pointers to finish with 30 points. Tyreke Evans took on a lot of the load as well, putting up a team-high 31 points to go with 10 assists. The Pelicans will have another tough test Sunday when they host the Golden State Warriors.Cleveland has dropped two straight games after having won their previous eight. LeBron James returned to the lineup after sitting out Thursday's loss to rest his knee. James tried to force the win Friday, scoring a game-high 41 points, but the Cavaliers simply couldn't stop the Pelicans on offense allowing them to shoot 56 percent from the field. Dion Waiters left the game with abdominal pain and was taken to the Ochsner Medical Center for evaluation. The Cavaliers will host the Charlotte Hornets on Monday.

												The Detroit Pistons (4-19) went on the road and knocked off the Phoenix Suns (12-12) 105-103 on Friday night at the US Airways Center.Detroit finally got over the hump, snapping their 13-game losing streak against the Suns on Friday. They were led by a well-rounded team effort in which six players scored in double figures. Andre Drummond was the leader of the pack though, as he scored 23 points (10-14 FG, 3-4 FT) to go with 14 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 30 minutes of action. Josh Smith posted a double-double of his own, scoring 12 points (5-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-4 FT) to go with 11 rebounds. The Pistons saw eight players play 21 minutes or more in this game, and welcomed back shooting guard Jodie Meeks (back), who made his season debut, scoring 12 points (4-10 FG, 4-4 FT) to go with one rebound, one assist and one steal in 22 minutes. The Pistons continue their road trip Saturday in Sacramento against the Kings.The Suns also saw production from all over the roster, with seven players scoring in double figures. The leader was Goran Dragic, putting up 18 points (8-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) to go with five assists, five rebounds and two steals. P.J. Tucker had possibly the most impressive game, though, as he filled up the stat sheet, scoring 16 points (5-11 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-5 FT) to go with nine rebounds, three assists and three steals in 33 minutes. The Suns also welcomed back Isaiah Thomas from his ankle injury, and he played 28 minutes off the bench, scoring 10 points (3-11 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 3-4 FT). Phoenix has now lost four games in a row, and they'll look to turn it around on Sunday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Miami Heat (11-12) took down the Utah Jazz (6-17) 100-95 on Friday at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City.The Heat had lost five of their last six before grabbing this road win. Miami got the job done against the Jazz, largely due to an impressive night from Dwyane Wade, who scored 29 points (10-16 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 8-12 FG) to go with seven assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block in 35 minutes. Chris Bosh and Luol Deng were the only other players to hit double figures, with Bosh scoring 22 points (9-16 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) Deng scoring 14 points (5-7 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT). The Heat will look to keep it going against the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night.The Jazz were only able to get 10 minutes from Derrick Favors in this one, as he left the game with a sprained ankle. Losing the big man obviously hurt them, and it forced Rudy Gobert into extended action. Gobert scored nine points (2-2 FG, 5-6 FT) to go with 11 rebounds, five blocks, four assists and one steal in 26 minutes. Enes Kanter had a nice night for the Jazz as well, putting up 25 points (10-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) to go with eight rebounds.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (7-16) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (16-7) 112-110 in overtime on Friday. Los Angeles has won two straight games and four of their last seven. Nick Young paced all scorers with a season-high 29 points off the bench. Kobe Bryant followed close behind with 22 points and also dealt out nine assists. The recently benched Jeremy Lin and Carlos Boozer had productive games off the bench as they work to earn their starting spots back or at least assure themselves lots of minutes off the bench. Lin had 14 points and eight assists in 30 minutes, and Boozer finished with a double-double of 14 points and 13 rebounds in 31 minutes. The Lakers will have a chance to extend their win streak on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. San Antonio has dropped two of their last three games. Kawhi Leonard's (hand) absence meant a drop-off in defense for the Spurs on Friday, but they also welcomed back Tony Parker (hamstring), Tim Duncan (rest) and Manu Ginobili (rest) to the active roster. The Spurs coughed up an uncharacteristic 19 turnovers in the game, giving up 25 easy points off the loss of possessions. Tiago Splitter (calf) played in a second straight game, earning a season-high 15 minutes of run off the bench. Duncan kept the Spurs alive with a huge double-double of 19 points and 18 rebounds in 40 minutes, but it wasn't enough to get them the win. San Antonio will go on the road to play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday.

												The Cavaliers were unable to overcome the absence of LeBron James, falling to the Thunder 103-94 on Thursday night.James, who sat out with soreness in his knee, is 14-4 against Kevin Durant in his career, but could do nothing but watch from the sidelines as Durant and Russell Westbrook stifled a late run by the Cavaliers, whose eight-game winning streak was snapped. The Thunder opened up a 20-point lead early in the fourth quarter, courtesy of an 8-0 spree spurred by three-pointers by Reggie Jackson and Anthony Morrow. However, the Cavaliers responded, as a Matthew Dellavedova-led run brought Cleveland back to within four with just under two minutes to play. Following a timeout, the Thunder were able to regroup, as Kevin Durant scored Oklahoma City’s final eight points to put the game away.Durant finished with 19 points, six rebounds and five assists, converting 6-of-14 field goals. He continues to be on a strict 30-minute limit, though it’s likely to be lifted in the near future. Westbrook led the way with 26 points (12-24 FG), eight assists and seven rebounds, while Reggie Jackson added 13 points off the bench. Serge Ibaka had just seven points and no rebounds before fouling out in 26 minutes.Cleveland, which struggled to find quality shots without James, shot a paltry 37 percent from the floor but registered 30 free throw attempts, compared to Oklahoma City’s 22. Irving had a team-high 20 points (7-21 FG) to go with six assists, and Kevin Love added 18 points and 16 rebounds. Dellavedova, who drew the start in place of James, finished with 14 points, including four three-pointers.Both teams are on the first night of a back-to-back set. Cleveland heads to New Orleans to take on Anthony Davis and the Pelicans, while the Thunder play at Minnesota.

												John Wall had a double-double, Kris Humphries added 11 points and the Wizards (15-6) got a last-second layup from Bradley Beal to knock off the Magic (9-15) 91-89 on Wednesday.Washington, winners of six of its last seven games, trailed by eight entering the fourth quarter but was able to hold the Celtics to just 14 points in the final 12 minutes. The Wizards slowly chipped away at the Boston lead, and a John Wall-led run late in the period brought the Wizards to within one with 32 seconds to play. A Rasual Butler free throw with 16 seconds to play tied the game, and Victor Oladipo misfired on a long jumper on the other end, giving the Wizards a chance to win with 0.8 seconds remaining. That’s all Beal would need, as he caught a perfect inbound lob from Andre Miller and laid it in as time expired.Beal had just eight points on the night, going a quiet 4-of-8 from the field in 34 minutes. Wall finished with 21 points and 11 assists and Marcin Gortat added 10 points and five rebounds. Paul Piece added eight points, six boards and five assists. In his return from a five-game absence, Nene chipped in 12 points and six rebounds off the bench.Orlando was led by 17 points (7-16 FG) and six rebounds from Oladipo.

												The Atlanta Hawks (2-19) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (15-6) 95-79 on Wednesday.Atlanta has won eight straight games and sit at second place in the Eastern Conference standings. They've been healthy most of the season, giving them a great deal of consistency in their rotation from night to night. Both teams shot just 42 percent from the field Wednesday, but the Hawks earned several extra possessions by collecting 16 offensive rebounds and beating the Sixers in total rebounds 52-39. The Hawks will host the Orlando Magic on Friday.Philadelphia has won two of their last four games, showing greater cohesion on the court since Tony Wroten went down with a knee injury six games ago, opening the door to allow Michael Carter-Williams to operate as the lone primary ball-handler. Alexey Shved returned to the lineup after missing three games with a hip injury. He played 16 minutes off the bench and finished with 13 points. Wroten is targeting a return to the court Friday when the Sixers take on the Nets in Brooklyn.During the game, it was reported by members of the media that the Sixers and Brooklyn Nets agreed to a trade that would include sending Brandon Davies to the Nets in exchange for Andrei Kirilenko and other minor pieces. The deal is not expected to be finalized until sometime Thursday.

The Hornets (6-15) used a third quarter run to send the Celtics (7-13) to their second consecutive loss.Charlotte, which has won two straight after dropping 10 in a row, outscored the Celtics 33-21 in the third quarter, opened the period on a 14-6 run, taking a 54-51 lead on a Gerald Henderson three-pointer with 7:37 remaining. The lead reached double-digits near the end of the third, but the Celtics battled back in the fourth quarter, pulling within two on a Marcus Thornton jumper with less than five minutes to play. However, Charlotte responded with nine straight points, all of which came courtesy of Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson, to put the game away. Jefferson led all scorers with 23 points and 14 rebounds in 36 minutes. Walker finished with 18 points and seven assists, and Lance Stephenson had 13 points on 6-of-14 shooting. After missing 12 games with a leg injury, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist returned to action, scoring nine points to go with six rebounds in 19 minutes.Rajon Rondo led Boston with his second triple-double in three games, putting up 12 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Jeff Green added 16 points, and Tyler Zeller added 13 to go with eight boards. Thornton finished with 16 points in 19 minutes off the bench.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (5-16) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (17-5) 90-82 on Wednesday.Minnesota put a basic lid on their six-game losing streak with the win. They remain without several of their key players as Ricky Rubio (ankle), Kevin Martin (wrist) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) are all expected to be out for at least a few more weeks. Andrew Wiggins has struggled to find consistency in his first 21 games as a rookie, but he came up big with his second straight 20-point game Wednesday, finishing with a double-double of 23 points and 10 rebounds in 44 minutes. Coach Flip Saunders wanted to compete for a playoff spot this season, but the team's injuries and place in the standings has caused him to consider the possibility of changing the team's focus toward the development of their younger players. That could mean the team looks at moving some of their veteran players later this season. The Timberwolves will have another great test Friday when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder.Portland had their five-game win streak snapped with the loss. Playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Trail Blazers didn't seem to have enough spring left in their legs, as they shot just 39 percent from the field and were out-rebounded 56-38, giving up 20 offensive rebounds to the Timberwolves. Portland has two games left on their road trip, with their next matchup coming against the Chicago Bulls on Friday. 											",Chicago,Bulls,Brooklyn,Nets,United Center,8,12,13,8,8.0,22.0,37.0,76.0,23.0,32.0,55.0,21.0,15.0,3.0,14.0,29.0,88.0,19.0,24.0,43.0,14.0,10.0,Mike Dunleavy,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,29,Alan Anderson,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,24,Taj Gibson,10.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Kevin Garnett,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Pau Gasol,16.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,16.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,34,Mason Plumlee,8.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Jimmy Butler,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,34,Sergey Karasev,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,31,Derrick Rose,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,15.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,23,Deron Williams,2.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,32,Kirk Hinrich,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,30,Jerome Jordan,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Nikola Mirotic,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,20,Cory Jefferson,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,13,Aaron Brooks,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Jarrett Jack,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,30,Cameron Bairstow,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Bojan Bogdanovic,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,16,Tony Snell,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Markel Brown,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4

												The Dallas Mavericks (17-7) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (10-11) 112-107 on Wednesday.Dallas has won two of their last four games, passing through a difficult part of their schedule. Jameer Nelson sat out Wednesday with a shoulder injury. Somewhat surprisingly, J.J. Barea moved into the starting lineup at point guard in Nelson's place. Monta Ellis scored a game-high 26 points on 11-of-19 shooting from the field after shooting just 1-of-11 from the field in the Mavericks' loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday. Four players scored at least 20 points for the Mavericks, with Devin Harris, Chandler Parsons and Dirk Nowitzki joining Ellis in accomplishing the feat. They overcame the Pelicans by shooting 53 percent from the field. Dallas will host the Golden State Warriors in a matinee game on Saturday.New Orleans has lost three of their last five games but were coming off back-to-back wins before dropping Wednesday's game. Anthony Davis scored a game-high 31 points and worked well with starting point guard Jrue Holiday, whom finished with 30 points and 10 assists. The Pelicans played well Wednesday, but the Mavericks simply played better. Eric Gordon is expected to miss at least three more weeks as he continues to try and work back from his shoulder injury in an effort to avoid surgery. New Orleans will return home to host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (16-6) defeated the New York Knicks (4-20) 109-95 on Wednesday.San Antonio was playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, coming off a 100-96 loss to the Utah Jazz on Tuesday. As coach Gregg Popovich is wont to do, he opted to sit all of his starters, since the team was already missing several players due to injury. Tony Parker (hamstring) missed his third straight game. Kawhi Leonard suffered a hand injury in Tuesday's game that kept him out as well. Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan sat out to get rest, though Ginobili is supposedly dealing with a shoulder issue as well. Tiago Splitter had missed all but one game so far this season with a calf injury but made his return to action Wednesday, playing eight minutes off the bench. All 10 available players saw action for the Spurs, and all of them finished with a positive plus/minus. They'll host the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, and if the team is eager to get their players more rest, it's possible they'll use the same lineup Friday.New York is on a 10-game losing streak, and the media's honeymoon with the new front office led by Phil Jackson and the team's rookie head coach Derek Fisher seemed to come to an end this week as several outlets began questioning his rotation choices and the team's dogged push to install the triangle offense. As a team, they performed well on offense, shooting 49 percent from the field, but they committed 25 personal fouls, giving the Spurs 25 free points at the foul line, which ultimately was their downfall.

												The Chicago Bulls (13-8) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (8-12) 105-80 on Wednesday. Several Chicago players voiced their frustration and displeasure with their recent play after being defeated 112-102 by the Golden State Warriors on Saturday, and they came out to play with a purpose Wednesday, despite being without starting center Joakim Noah (ankle). Taj Gibson moved into the starting lineup in Noah's absence and put up 11 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks in 31 minutes. Derrick Rose scored a game-high 23 points in just 24 minutes. The Bulls will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday.Brooklyn is dealing with several injuries and are mired in trade rumors surrounding several of their players, putting their status as a competitive squad for the remainder of the season in question. Brook Lopez is expected to miss the rest of this week with a back injury, while Joe Johnson missed a second straight game due to illness and Mirza Teletovic sat out with a hip pointer. Brooklyn's inability to score was their main issue Wednesday as the team shot a woeful 33 percent from the field. Several outlets reported during the game that Andrei Kirilenko and other pieces will be traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Brandon Davies, but the trade is not expected to become official until Thursday. The Nets will host the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.

												James Harden scored 34 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome a fourth quarter run by Golden State, as the Rockets fell 105-93 on Wednesday.Playing without Dwight Howard, as well as a number of other key reserves, Houston shot 42 percent from the floor and 9-of-35 from beyond the arc. The offense relied heavily on Harden, who converted 14-of-27 field goals and 3-of-8 three-pointers to go with eight rebounds, four assists and four steals. Patrick Beverley added 12 points, while Donatas Motiejunas and Trevor Ariza (5-14 FG, 4-12 3Pt) each had 18. Golden State, winners of 14 straight, maintained its grasp on the league’s best record behind 20 points, seven rebounds and seven assists from Stephen Curry. Klay Thompson added 21 points despite converting just 1-of-8 three-point attempts, and Harrison Barnes chipped in 20 points and seven rebounds of his own. Starting in place of the injured Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli had seven points and three rebounds in 16 minutes.The road ahead doesn’t get any easier for Golden State, which takes on the Mavericks on Saturday. Following that matchup, New Orleans, Memphis, Oklahoma City and Sacramento await on the schedule. Houston, meanwhile, plays in Sacramento Thursday night. Howard is not expected to play and hopes to return for Saturday’s game against Denver.

												The Nuggets (10-12) sent the Heat (10-12) to their fifth loss in six games with a 102-82 beatdown in Denver on Wednesday night.The Nuggets were led by 17 points and eight rebounds from Wilson Chandler and 16 points (6-8 FG) from Arron Afflalo. Ty Lawson added 10 points and nine assists, while Timofey Mozgov chipped in nine points and 10 rebounds. Kenneth Faried, who missed the last two games with a back injury, added 13 points and eight assists off the bench.With the game tied at halftime, Denver turned things on in the third quarter, opening the period on a 11-2 run and never looking back. The Nuggets would go on to outscore Miami by 17 in the period, essentially sealing the victory with 12 minutes to play.Miami struggled offensively for the majority of the night, shooting 37 percent as a team and connecting on 7-of-22 attempts from downtown. Dwyane Wade, in particularly, had a rough outing, going 4-of-15 from he field for 10 points. Chris Bosh had 14 points (5-12 FG) but managed only two rebounds. Luol Deng and Mario Chalmers were the only other Heat players in double-figures, chipping in 12 and 11 points, respectively.Miami continues its roadtrip in Utah on Friday, while Denver heads to Houston to take on the Rockets in the first half of a home-in-home Saturday night.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (13-7) defeated the Toronto Raptors (16-6) 105-101 on Tuesday.Cleveland has won eight straight games, keeping their spot with the fourth-best record in the Eastern Conference, trailing only the Raptors, Atlanta Hawks and Washington Wizards. The Cavs and Raptors have played three games against each other already this season, with the Raptors taking their first matchup and the Cavaliers taking the last two. LeBron James took on the scoring load Tuesday, finishing with 35 points, while Kyrie Irving facilitated and finished with a double-double of 13 points and 10 assists. Mike Miller has missed the last three games with a concussion. Tuesday was the earliest he could have returned, but he wasn't ready. Toronto has dropped two of their last three games, both losses coming against the Cavaliers. DeMar DeRozan's absence with an adductor injury is having a noticeable impact on the Raptors. They used Greivis Vasquez as the fill-in starter at shooting guard for the first five games DeRozan was out, but they opted to move Vasquez back to the bench and insert Landry Fields into the starting lineup Tuesday to try and put a bigger player on the wing to guard James. The Raptors took the game down to the wire, with Jonas Valanciunas (18 points, 15 rebounds) and Kyle Lowry (16 points, 14 assists) both putting up double-doubles, but their quality performances weren't enough to put the Raptors over the top.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (17-4) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-19) 98-86 on Tuesday.Portland is on a five-game win streak. LaMarcus Aldridge took home the game-high scoring honors for a second straight game, finishing with 23 points. The Blazers shot 49 percent from the field, compared to the Pistons' 35 percent from the field, which tells the gross part of the story as to how they came away with the win. They didn't sell the Pistons any buckets.Detroit has lost 13 straight games in what has been a nightmarish start to the season. Coach Stan Van Gundy has tried to be patient with his rotations and starting lineup, but the players haven't rewarded him with much in the win column. Greg Monroe's 22-point, 10-rebound double-double in 33 minutes off the bench was the only bright spot from the Pistons. They could have Jodie Meeks (back) make his season debut in Friday's game, and it'll be interesting to see if a single role player can help them dig out of the hole they've dug.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (17-4) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (16-7) 114-105 on Tuesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.Despite being out-scored 62-56 in the first half, the Grizzlies came out hot in the third quarter and scored 19 more points than the Mavericks, setting them up for the victory in front of their home crowd. Memphis was able to use their superior shooting to give them the advantage, which was just enough to secure the win.The Grizzlies were led by the duo of Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. Gasol had a game-high of 30 points (9-14 FG), while also contributing six assists and five rebounds. He was able to get to the free throw line a wopping 13 times, and converted on 12 out of those attempts. Conley on the other hand shot 9-for-13 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 22 points. He continued to shoot well after not missing a shot on Sunday against the Miami Heat. He's now averaging 16.7 points and 6.3 assists per game. Zach Randolph also had a big impact and scored 17 points (6-18 FG, 5-6 FT), to go along with 13 rebounds. It marked his twelth double-double of the year. Both Tayshaun Prince and Beno Udrih reached double figures off the bench with 11 and 10 points respectively.Chandler Parsons continued his hot shooting for the Mavericks. He went 10-for-18 from the field and 6-for-10 from beyond the arc to score a team-high of 30 points, while also grabbing seven rebounds. He's now combined for 58 points and 12 rebounds in the last two games, as he continued with his offensive momentum. Jameer Nelson also had a nice game from the floor, shooting 6-for-9 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score 18 points. Nelson had scored a combined seven points over his last two outings, so he was due for a breakout game. Monta Ellis had been on fire over the last week or so, but really struggled with his shot against the Grizzlies and finished with only two points (1-11 FG, 0-3 3Pt). Both Jae Crowder and Jose Barea had decent games off the bench with 13 and 17 points apiece.   The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (10-10) defeated the New York Knicks (4-19) 104-93 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Pelicans had only a two-point lead heading into halftime, but were able to out-score the Knicks 50-41 in the second half, allowing them to coast to a victory in front of their home crowd. The Pelicans secured a heavy rebounding advantage, as they out-rebounded the Knicks 43-30, only furthering the advantage to the Pelicans in this one.While Anthony Davis is usually relied upon to guide the Pelicans, it was Tyreke Evans who took the lead on Tuesday. Evans shot a fantastic 11-for-15 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 27 points, while also handing out six assists. It was nice bounce back game for him after shooting only 33 percent against the Lakers on Sunday. While Davis didn't have the most points, he still contributed 18 points (6-14 FG, 6-9 FT), eight rebounds and three blocks. While his totals were well below his season averages of 25.2 points and 10.7 assists, it was still enough to get the Pelicans a victory. Omer Asik chipped in with 16 points and 14 rebounds, giving him his fifth game in a row with at least 10 rebounds. It was also his fifth double-double of the year. Jrue Holiday was the only other Pelican to reach double figures in points, as he finished with 13 points (6-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-1 FT), seven assists and six rebounds.As has been the case over the last few weeks, the Knicks received most of their production from Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Stoudemire led all scorers with 26 points (11-18 FG, 4-6 FT), while also grabbing five rebounds. It was a season high for Stoudemire, who's only reached the 20-point mark one other time this season. Anthony on the other hand shot 6-for-11 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 17  points and added eight rebounds. He didn't get nearly as many shots off as he has most of the season so far, so it resulted in scoring less than his season average of 22.9 points per game. With the other starters struggling to make an impact, the only other player to reach double figures was Jason Smith, who came off the bench to score 17 points (6-18 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-4 FT). He's now combined for 37 points in the last two games, as he's been a big factor off the bench for the Knicks.The Pelicans next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Knicks will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Wednesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (8-13) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (11-12) 114-101 on Tuesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.The Thunder took advantage of their superior shooting in this one. They shot 50 percent from the field, compared to the Bucks who shot only 41 percent from the field. Despite turning the ball over 20 times, the Thunder were also able to out-rebound the Bucks 54-31, giving them enough of an advantage to sneak out the victory at home on Tuesday.The Thunder are thrilled to have both of their superstars back from injury as both Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook led the Thunder to the victory in this one. Westbrook had a team-high of 28 points (8-16 FG, 0-2 3Pt), while also handing out seven assists. He was able to get to the line at will, and converted on 12-of-15 attempts. He's now scored over 20 points in seven out of the eight games he's played this season, recording season averages of 24.3 points and 6.6 assists per game. Durant on the other hand shot 7-for-11 from the field, but only 1-for-5 from the three-point line to score 23 points. He went a perfect 8-for-8 from the free throw line and came close to a triple-double with nine rebounds and seven assists. The rebounds and assists were season-highs for Durant. Serge Ibaka had a solid all-around game in the victory as he went a perfect 5-for-5 from the field to score 15 points. Reggie Jackson supplied the Thunder with an effective bench presence as well with 18 points and seven rebounds.O.J. Mayo was the leading scorer on the other side for the Bucks, as he shot 6-for-13 from the field, but only 0-for-4 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 18 points. He eventually had to leave the game though, as he fouled out before the end of regulation. Giannis Antetokounmpo was also able to reach double figures with 17 points and seven rebounds. He didn't shoot all that well from the field (4-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt), but he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times and converted on eight of those attempts. Rookie Jabari Parker was the other starter to reach double-digits in points. He finished 7-for-13 from the field to score 15 points, marking his second straight night totaling 15 points. Jarryd Bayless had the most production off the bench as he went 3-for-6 from the field and 5-for-5 from the free throw line to score 11 points.The Thunders' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, while the Bucks will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Milwaukee,Bucks,Chesapeake Energy Arena,11,12,8,13,4.0,21.0,40.0,81.0,28.0,32.0,52.0,23.0,20.0,4.0,21.0,34.0,84.0,29.0,35.0,31.0,19.0,14.0,Kevin Durant,9.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,7.0,11.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,28,Giannis Antetokounmpo,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,26,Serge Ibaka,5.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,15.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Jabari Parker,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Steven Adams,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Larry Sanders,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Andre Roberson,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,22,O.J.

												The Miami Heat (10-11) defeated the Phoenix Suns (12-11) 103-97 on Tuesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.While the Suns went into halftime with the lead, the Heat were able to out-score them 57-46 in the second half to secure the comeback victory on the road. Miami was also able to shoot 54 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three-point line compared to the Suns, who shot 48 percent from the field and 49 percent from beyond the arc.The Heat received almost no production from their bench in this one, as the bench scored only a combined total of 10 points. The starters were able to overcome the lobsided effort though, with Chris Bosh and Luol Deng leading the way. Bosh went 14-for-21 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 34 points and nine rebounds. The 34 points were a season high for Bosh, while he also showed up on the defensvie side and contributed four steals. Deng on the other hand had an outstanding shooting display, as he finished 9-for-12 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 23 points. Deng hasn't done much on the offensive side of the ball in the last four games, so it was nice to see him have a strong game. Dwyane Wade also reached double figures and finished with 16 points, six rebounds and five assists. He did have five turnovers though, so he'll look to cut back on those in the future.Coming off a triple-double, Eric Bledsoe struggled terribly. He shot only 2-for-11 from the field and 0-for-6 from the three-point line to finish with four points. It was his first time not reaching double figures in points in his last eight games. The Morris brothers collectively had respectable games for the Suns. Markieff went 6-for-11 from the field and 1-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while Marcus came off the bench and shot a fantastic 10-for-13 from the field and 5-for-6 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 25 points. Despite their effort it still wasn't enough though.

												The Utah Jazz (6-16) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (15-6) 100-96 on Tuesday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.While Tony Parker sat out with a strained left hamstring, the Jazz were able to take advantage and pull off an upset victory over one of the best teams in the Western Conference. The Jazz shot 50 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three-point line, while the Spurs shot 46 percent from the field and only 20 percent from beyond the arc. It gave them enough of an advanatage, to steal a victory against stiff competition.The Jazz's starters did most of the damage in this one. Gordon Hayward shot 7-for-13 from the field and 0-for-2 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while also adding seven rebounds. He's combined for 39 points in hist last two games and is now averaing 18.9 points per game. Derrick Favors also had a nice effort in the victory and contributed a team-high of 21 points and eight rebounds. He didn't have much of an impact in Monday's game against the Sacramento Kings, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Enes Kanter recorded 12 points and 15 rebounds, giving him his fourth double-double of the season. The only other Jazz player to reach double figures in points was Alec Burks, who scored 14 points and chipped in four assists.Starting in the absence of Tony Parker, Cory Joseph didn't do enough to make up for the effort that Parker would've contributed. He finished with only seven points, but also failed to record any assists or rebounds. Tim Duncan did most of the damage for the Spurs, as he posted a team-high of 23 points (10-16 FG, 3-4 FT) and 14 rebounds. It was his fourth double-double in a row, as he's now averaging 14.4 points and 10.5 rebounds on the year. Kawhi Leonard also had a solid offensive game, scoring 16 points (7-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-5 FT) and adding five assists and five rebounds. He had five steals, showing a significant defensive presence to go along with his offensive output. Coming off the bench, both Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli provided a boost with 10 and 13 points respectively, but it wasn't enough to propel the Spurs to the victory.The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday, while the Spurs will be at home against the New York Knicks on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (6-16) defeated the Sacramento Kings (11-11) 98-95 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The Lakers were down 81-78 following the third quarter, but were able to make a run in the final quarter, out-scoring the Kings 20-14 to finish off their comeback with a victory. The Kings showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line compared to the Lakers who shot 40 percent from the field and only 20 percent from beyond the arc, but they were forced into 16 turnovers, which allowed the Lakers to steal the victory.Kobe Bryant finished with a game-high in points. He went 11-for-27 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 32 points, while also handing out six assists. He was able to get to the free throw line eight times and converted on all eight attempts. It was a nice bounce back game for him after struggling with his shot against the Pelicans on Sunday. Ed Davis went a perfect 5-for-5 from the field to score 11 points, while grabbing six rebounds. It was his second game in a row in double figures, after not reaching more than six points in his last 10 games. The Lakers also had a nice effort from their bench with both Carlos Boozer and Nick Young playing well. Boozer finished with 15 points and nine rebounds, while Young had 12 points and four rebounds.DeMarcus Cousins continued to sit out for the Kings, which may have been the difference in this one. Rudy Gay and Darren Collison did everything they could to get the win. Gay went 7-for-18 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 23 points, while Collison went 11-for-18 from the field and 2-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 26 points. Gay has now combined for 52 points in his last two games, as he's attempted to make up for Cousins' absence. The only other King to reach double figures in points was Ben McLemore, who finished with 15 points and two assists. The bench didn't have much of a presence and only scored 18 points.The Kings' next game will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Thursday, while the Lakers will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (14-6) defeated the Indiana Pacers (7-14) 108-92 on Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.The Hawks got out quick and took it to the Pacers early, out-scoring them 60-43 in the first half. They demonstrated superior shooting, as they finished at 52 percent from the field and 43 percent from the three-point line compared to the Pacers, who shot 44 percent from the floor and only 33 percent from beyond the arc.The Hawks were led by the duo of Jeff Teague and Al Horford in this one. Horford had a team-high of 25 points (9-18 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 6-6 FT), while also grabbing eight rebounds. The 25 points were a season-high for Horford, who has struggled lately and has failed to reach the 20-point mark in his last six games. Teague had 21 points of his own and went 8-for-11 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line, as he had his shot dialed in all night. He also chipped in three steals, which was the third time he's done that in the last four games. Kyle Korver had a solid game as well, going 4-for-7 from the floor and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 13 points, while adding four assists.The only starter for the Pacers to reach double figures in points was Rodney Stuckey. He scored 15 points (6-11 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and recorded three assists in just over 27 minutes of playing time. With most of the starters struggling, the bench played a significant role in this one and scored 50 out of the 92 total points. C.J. Miles had the biggest contribution and went 5-for-11 from the field and 4-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 15 points. Considering he's averaging only 7.3 points on the year, it was a nice surprise for the Pacers. The other bench contribution came from Luis Scola, who came one rebound shy of a double-double and finished with 12 points and nine rebounds.The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, while the Pacers will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday as well.

												The Washington Wizards (14-6) defeated the Boston Celtics (7-12) 133-132 on Monday at the Verizon Center in Washington D.C.The Wizards had a comfortable lead going into the fourth quarter of this game, but were out-scored 34-18 in the fourth quarter, leading to not one, but two overtime periods. The Wizards were able to get a running layup from John Wall with just over 40 seconds left, who then hit his free throw to convert on the three-point play after being fouled by Evan Turner on the attempt. Turner then had a shot to win the game with a second left in the game, but missed, giving the Wizards their fourteenth victory of the season.The Wizards had all five of their starters score at least 14 points. Paul Pierce led all scorers as he had an outstanding game shooting, going 9-for-12 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score 28 points. He also was a perfect 6-for-6 from the line pushing him to a season-high in points. John Wall really stuffed the stat sheet as well. He scored 26 points (10-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-8 FT) and recorded a wopping 17 assists, leading to his fourth double-double in the last five games. He did have a season-high of nine turnovers, so he'll look to trim those numbers down. Marcin Gortat had a double-double of his own, scoring 21 points and pulling in 12 rebounds. He's now averaging 13.9 points and nine rebounds on the year. The other two starters, Kris Humphries and Bradley Beal had 17 and 14 points respectively.Jeff Green led the Celtics with 28 points (8-18 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 11-11 FT), but the bench was just as huge in this one, with four players scoring at least 18 points. Rookie Marcus Smart had easily his best game of his career, as he scored 23 points (7-14 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 5-5 FT), while adding five assists. It was the most minutes he's played all season, and he cashed in on the extra playing time. Brandon Bass and Kelly Olynyk had 19 points each, with Bass chipping in nine rebounds, while Olynyk grabbed 11. Despite missing the game winner, Evan Turner was also successful off the bench, scoring 18 points and contributing eight assists and six rebounds. The bench had 82 of the 132 total points for the Celtics.The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, while the Celtics will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (12-7) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (8-11) 110-88 on Monday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Despite the Cavaliers leading only 50-49 going into halftime, they came out on fire in the second half and out-scored the Nets 60-39, allowing them to coast to a 22-point victory on the road. The Cavaliers severely out-rebounded the Nets as well, grabbing 55 compared to only 33 recorded by Brooklyn.The Cavaliers got a huge boost off the bench in this one, with three players scoring at least 12 points. Dion Waiters recorded a season and game-high of 26 points (11-21 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 3-3 FT), while also handing out four assists. It was only the second time he's reached the 20-point mark all year, so that should only help his confidence. Tristan Thompson was also a big contributor off the bench and recorded his second double-double in a row, finishing with 14 points and 12 rebounds. He's combined for 35 points and 25 rebounds in the past two games. Although the bench played well, both LeBron James and Kevin Love did their part. James finished with 18 points (8-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and seven assists, while Love recorded 19 points (7-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-6 FT) and 14 rebounds. It was Love's fifth straight double-double.The Nets were led by Kevin Garnett and Deron Williams. Garnett finished with 14 points (6-9 FG, 2-3 FT) and seven rebounds. He hasn't been much of an offensive presence this year and it was only the first time in the past eight games that he's reached double figures in points. Williams really struggled with his shot, as he went only 3-for-14 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line, but he did convert on all six of his free throws, so that was where the majority of his 13 points came from. Williams also added 11 assists, giving him his second double-double of the year. Mirza Teletovic was the other starter to reach double-digit points, as he finished with 11.  The Cavaliers next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, while the Nets will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday.

												The Toronto Raptors (16-5) defeated the Denver Nuggets (9-12) 112-107 on Monday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.The Raptors were able to get out to a 62-52 lead after the first half, but the Nuggets turned in a big third quarter and evened it back up going into the fourth. After ending regulation tied 102-102, they went into overtime where the Raptors held the Nuggets to only five points, therefore securing the victory.The Raptors received a big contribution off the bench in the overtime win. Louis Williams led all scorers with 26 points (7-16 FG, 3-10 3Pt, 9-10 FT), while also grabbing three rebounds. It was a nice bounce back game for him, after scoring only five points on Friday against the Cavaliers. Patrick Patterson was the other big bench presence, as he went 7-for-11 from the field and 5-for-7 from the three-point line to score 19 points. He also chipped in eight rebounds, in what was arguably one of his best games of the year. Starting at center, Jonas Valanciunas recorded his fifth double-double of the year, finishing with 18 points and 12 rebounds. He did it on the defensive side of the ball as well and recorded a season-high of four blocks. Kyle Lowry and Terrence Ross had 13 and 16 points respectively, with Lowry handing out 13 assists.The Nuggets backcourt did most of the damage to the Raptors. Arron Afflalo went 9-for-14 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score a team-high of 25 points, while adding six rebounds. Ty Lawson also had a big game and recorded 22 points (8-19 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and 12 assists. It was his ninth straight game with at least 10 assists. Wilson Chandler got off a team-high of 21 shots, but only converted on seven, giving him 18 points on the night. He's now combined for 67 points in the last three games, as he continues to get off a ridiculous amount of shots. Both J.J. Hickson and Timofey Mozgov reached double-figures, scoring 10 and 15 points respectively. Mozgov contributed 12 rebounds to go along with his 15 points, giving him his second double-double in a row.  The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavliers on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Miami Heat on Tuesday as well.

												The Golden State Warriors (18-2) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (4-16) 102-86 on Monday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.Right from the tip-off, the Warriors were clearly the better offensive team in this one. They capped off the first half with a 48-39 point lead, giving them enough of an advantage to coast to a victory on the road. They shot 46 percent from the field and 23 percent from the three-point line, while the Timberwolves shot only 36 percent from the floor and a dismal 18 percent from beyond the arc.The Warriors superstar backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson was again the difference in this game, helping lead them to their thirteenth straight victory and a league-leading eighteen wins. Despite only going 1-for-7 from beyond the arc, Curry still hit 10-for-20 from the field, giving him 21 points, while also adding seven assists. Thompson on the other hand went 7-for-15 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 21 points of his own. The Timberwolves just didn't have a difference maker on defense who could shut either of the guards down, so they didn't have much hope in this one. Draymond Green struggled with his shot (3-10 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT), but was still able to contribute 10 points and 10 rebounds, giving him his second double-double in the last three games. Shaun Livingston and Marreese Speights chipped in 12 points apiece off the bench.Rookie Andrew Wiggins did all he could to keep the Timberwolves in the game. He went 8-for-19 from the field and 0-for-1 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while also pulling in six rebounds. It was the first time in the last eight games he was able to reach the 20-point mark, pushing his season average to 11.4 points per game. Thaddeus Young reached double figures as well, scoring 13 points (5-11 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and grabbing seven rebounds. With so many injuries, Shabazz Muhammad continued to be a solid presence of the bench, as he went 4-for-8 from the field and a perfect 6-for-6 from the free throw line to score 14 points. He's now averaging 10.8 points and 3.4 rebounds on the year.  The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday as well. 											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Golden State,Warriors,Target Center,18,2,4,16,2.0,11.0,32.0,87.0,19.0,27.0,47.0,22.0,19.0,4.0,21.0,41.0,87.0,13.0,14.0,49.0,24.0,16.0,Andrew Wiggins,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,38,Harrison Barnes,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,29,Thaddeus Young,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,30,Draymond Green,10.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,30,Gorgui Dieng,11.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Andrew Bogut,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2,Corey Brewer,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,33,Klay Thompson,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,15.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,29,Zach LaVine,4.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,16.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,41,Stephen Curry,4.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,21.0,10.0,20.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,31,Shabazz Muhammad,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,18,Festus Ezeli,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,21,Anthony Bennett,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Shaun Livingston,5.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,25,Robbie Hummel,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,15,Andre Iguodala,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,23,Chase Budinger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8,Marreese Speights,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Glenn Robinson III,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6,Leandro Barbosa,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8

												The Sacramento Kings (11-10) defeated the Utah Jazz (5-16) 101-92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.Despite only having five victories on the year, the Jazz put up a fight and kept even with the Kings all the way up until the start of the fourth quarter. The Kings were able to use a significant rebounding advantage and superior shooting to out-score the Jazz 33-24 in the final quarter, thus sealing the nine-point victory at home.With DeMarcus Cousins still sitting out with an illness, Rudy Gay continued to take the lead for the Kings. He shot 10-for-19 from the field and 0-for-1 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 29 points. He also got to the free throw line 10 times, and was able to convert on nine of those attempts, pushing his season scoring average to 21.1 points per game. Darren Collison was an important piece in the victory. He scored 16 points (6-12 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and handed out six assists in 32 minutes, as he also was continued to be relied upon to make up for the loss of Cousins. Nik Stauskas had arguably his best game of the season, as he recorded a season-high of 15 points (6-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and eight rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench.The Jazz failed to receive very much production from their bench, therefore putting it on the shoulders of their starters. Gordon Hayward led the team with 19 points (6-16 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 6-10 FT) and seven assists, while also matching a season-high with four steals. He struggled against the Magic on Friday, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Alec Burks chipped in 16 points (5-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-9 FT) of his own, as he's put together a couple of solid games in a row. He's combined for 38 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in the previous two games, giving the Jazz a little bit of everything. Both Enes Kanter and Trey Burke finished with 13 points, but it wasn't enough to propel the Jazz past the Kings.   The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Jazz will play the San Antonio Spurs at home on Tuesday as well.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (15-5) defeated the Phoenix Suns (12-10) 121-120 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.With the game tied at the end of the fourth quarter, Chris Paul was chosen to take the final shot. He barely got the shot off, but it didn't matter, as Eric Bledsoe got a hand on it, therefore pushing the game to overtime. Although they weren't able to seal the win at the end of regulation, the Clippers still got the last laugh, as Blake Griffin capped off his spectacular night with a three-point dagger at the buzzer.Griffin was a force tonight, as he went 14-for-24 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 45 points. He was able to get to the free throw line at will, and finished the game making 15-of-17. He's now combined for 75 points in the last two games and is on a scoring tear. Griffin did have some help though. Chris Paul scored 20 points (8-23 FG, 1-9 3Pt, 3-4 FT), while also recording 10 assists. It marked his third double-double in a row and eleventh on the year. DeAndre Jordan also recorded a double-double of his own, with 10 points and 14 rebounds. It was the fifteenth time in his last sixteen games that he's recorded at least 11 rebounds. J.J. Redick chipped in 17 points as well.  For the Suns, Eric Bledsoe exploded for a monster line Monday. He shot 8-for-16 from the field and 2-for-6 from beyond the arc to score 27 points, while also adding 16 assists, 11 rebounds and two blocks. Bledsoe was able to convert on a perfect 9-of-9 from the free throw line as well. The points, assists and rebounds were all season-highs for Bledsoe, who notched his first triple-double of the year. He has been on fire offensively of late, so we'll see if he can continue with that type of production. Both Markief Morris and Goran Dragic also had big games, with Morris contributing 21 points and seven rebounds, and Dragic having 17 points and eight assists. Their was a nice bench presence as well, with Alex Len, Gerald Green and Marcus Morris all reaching double figures in points.The Suns' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Tuesday, while the Clippers will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Wednesday.

												Jeff Green scored 25 points and Marcus Thornton added 21, leading the Celtics to a 101-93 victory over the Wizards in Boston on Sunday.In a game in which Boston nearly blew a 25-point second-half lead, Rajon Rondo recorded a triple-double (13 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists) as the Celtics won their third straight game. Rasual Butler paced Washington with 22 points and four rebounds, while John Wall had 17 points and 14 assists. Bradley Beal, who shot just 4-of-18 from the floor, finished with 10 points and Paul Pierce added 16 in his first game in Boston as a member of the Wizards.Washington shot a paltry 37 percent from the floor but converted 11-of-27 three-point attempts and won the rebounding battle 52-49. The Wizards turned the ball over 19 times, six of which were charged to Wall. Boston, which led by 17 entering the final period, allowed the Wizards to creep back into the game, and a Butler three-pointer with just under three minutes remaining sliced the lead to just one. After a pair of Tyler Zeller free throws, Wall responded with a lay-in on the other end, but Avery Bradley responded with a corner three-pointer to put Boston up by four. On the ensuing Washington possession, Wall turned the ball over and Boston was able to salt the game away at the free throw line.The teams will head south to the nation's capital for a rematch Monday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks (13-6) defeated the Denver Nuggets (9-11) 96-84 on Sunday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.The Nuggets had trouble scoring the ball in this one, shooting only 36 percent from the field and a meager 17 percent from the three-point line. The Hawks on the other hand shot 41 percent from the floor and 37 percent beyond the arc. Despite out-rebounding the Hawks 52-43, the Nuggets weren't able to overcome their shooting woes and suffered their third straight loss. Atlanta secured their sixth straight win behind Paul Millsap's big game. He went 6-for-13 from the field and 4-for-5 from the three-point line to score a team-leading 23 points. He also got to the free throw line 10 times, converting on seven of those attempts. He only recorded two rebounds though, which were a season-low for the forward. Kyle Korver was another key piece in this victory. He scored 15 points (6-12 FG, 3-7 3Pt) and contributed five rebounds in 33 minutes. It was a nice bounce back game for him after scoring only seven points Friday against the Nets. Both DeMarre Carroll and Al Horford pitched in 11 points, while also combining for 17 rebounds. Jeff Teague really struggled with his shot (4-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt) but still added nine points and a team-high of seven assists. He had combined for 41 points in the previous two games, so he cooled off a bit Sunday. The Nuggets received most of their offensive production from Wilson Chandler, who got off a season-high of 22 shots. He finished the game going 12-for-22 from the field and 4-for-12 from beyond the arc to score 29 points. He also recorded 10 rebounds, giving him his second double-double in the last three games. He's been on a roll of late, scoring a combined 67 points in the last three games despite only averaging 13.7 points on the year. Timofey Mozgov notched a double-double of his own, as he finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. It was his sixth of the season. The only other Denver player to reach double figures in points was Arron Afflalo, who contributed an inefficient 10 points (4-14 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 0-2 FT). In an overall poor team-effort offensively Sunday, Ty Lawson had arguably the worst night of all, going only 1-for-10 from the field and 0-for-5 from the three-point line. He had four points, but did chip in 10 assists. The Hawks will travel to Indiana on Monday to play the Pacers, while the Nuggets will go on the road to Toronto to play the Raptors on Monday as well.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (16-4) defeated the Miami Heat (9-11) 103-87 on Sunday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis.Despite only leading 82-75 going into the fourth quarter, the Grizzlies were able to out-score the Heat 21-12 in the final quarter to give themselves a comfortable 16-point victory at home. Memphis was able to shoot extremely well in this one, as they went 59 percent from the field and a ridiculous 62 percent from the three-point line. Miami on the other hand finished at only 49 percent from the floor and 31 percent from beyond the arc.In a surprise performance off the bench, Jon Leuer was a big contributor to the Grizzlies superior shooting percentages. He went 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score a season-high of 20 points in 23 minutes. He also had a season-high of 10 rebounds, giving him his first double-double of the year. He's averaging just over 14 minutes per game on the season, so he was able to cash in on the extra playing time he received. Mike Conley also had one of his better games of the season. He went a perfect 8-for-8 from the field and 2-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in only 27 minutes. He had 23 points against the Spurs on Friday and 15 against a tough Rockets team Wednesday, so he's had a nice stretch of games during the last week. Courtney Lee (7-9 FG, 3-3 3Pt) and Zach Randolph (8-15 FG, 1-1 FT) also reached double figures in points with 17 apiece. Marc Gasol was one of the lone players to struggle offensively, as he had only two points in 27 minutes, but he still had six rebounds and seven assists, so it wasn't all bad for Gasol. Dwyane Wade had a strong game for the Heat. He went 11-for-20 from the field and 3-for-5 from the free throw line to score 25 points, while also adding six assists. He's caught fire in the last three games, scoring 28, 28 and now 25 over that stretch. Wade is now averaging 22 points and 5.9 assists on the season. Chris Bosh didn't have as big of a game as he's come accustomed to. He scored 12 points (6-12 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 0-2 FT) and recorded only two rebounds in 35 minutes. It was his first time in nine games not reaching at least 15 points, and only the second time all season grabbing less than five rebounds, so don't expect him to have this sort of game again any time soon. Mario Chalmers had 12 out of the 19 points from the Heat's bench, while also notching his second game in row with at least four steals. The rest of the bench really struggled, which may have been the deciding factor in this one. The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, while the Heat will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Tuesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (7-13) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-18) 96-94 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.The Pistons came up just shy of ending their losing streak, but instead extended it to a twelth straight game Sunday. The Pistons were up 55-48 at halftime, but came out of the half struggling and were out-scored 29-20 in what would be the difference in this game. The Thunder also out-rebounded Detroit 50-39, giving them even more of an advantage. In just his third game of the season, Kevin Durant went off for 28 points (10-19 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 7-8 FT), four rebounds and four assists. After scoring only 10 points on Friday against the Sixers, Durant really turned it around and pushed his season averages to 21.7 points and 4.3 rebounds after Sunday's matchup. Superstar Russell Westbrook also had a big game. He went 9-for-19 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score 22 points. He had 11 rebounds and seven assists, coming just shy of recording his first triple-double of the year. Like Durant, he's missed most of the season up until this point, but has come out strong in his first six games and is averaging 24 points and 6.4 assists. The third member of the Thunder's big three, Serge Ibaka, finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds. It was his fifth double-double of the season. Jeremy Lamb was the only other Thunder to reach double-digits in points with 12 off the bench. Despite getting to the line 28 times compared to only 17 attempts from the Thunder, the Pistons couldn't close out the game. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led all scorers for Detroit, going 6-for-12 from the field and 1-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 19 points. He also chipped in with a season-high of five assists, after not recording more than two since the season opener. Andre Drummond played well in the loss. He scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds, coming one rebound shy of his tenth double-double of the year. Both Josh Smith and Greg Monroe also chipped in 12 points respectively, with Monroe adding eight rebounds, as the most consistent player off the bench. Brandon Jennings had a tough night offensively and finished with only six points (3-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt). He did have nine assists though, so it wasn't all bad for the starting guard. The Thunders' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday, while the Pistons will play the Portland Trail Blazers at home on Tuesday. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Little Caesars Arena,7,13,3,18,7.0,23.0,34.0,76.0,19.0,28.0,39.0,25.0,12.0,6.0,21.0,39.0,87.0,12.0,17.0,50.0,20.0,15.0,Kyle Singler,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,35,Kevin Durant,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,19.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,29,Josh Smith,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21,Serge Ibaka,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,13.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,32,Andre Drummond,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Steven Adams,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,32,Andre Roberson,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Brandon Jennings,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,28,Russell Westbrook,11.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,19.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,34,Greg Monroe,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,24,Anthony Morrow,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,23,Cartier Martin,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15,Kendrick Perkins,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Jonas Jerebko,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Reggie Jackson,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,28,Caron Butler,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12,Jeremy Lamb,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,21,D.J.

												The Dallas Mavericks (16-6) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (11-11) 125-102 on Sunday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.The Mavericks used their superior shooting in this matchup, as they went 58 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line. The Bucks in comparison shot 50 percent from the floor and only 27 percent from beyond the arc. The Mavericks also forced the Bucks into 19 turnovers, which only added to Dallas' advantage in the 23-point victory.The trio of Chandler Parsons, Dirk Nowitzki and Monta Ellis really killed the Bucks. Parsons couldn't miss and went 11-for-14 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line to score a game-high of 28 points. He's averaged just under 15 points up to this point, so it was a nice surprise for the Mavericks to get the type of production they've been looking for all season from him. Nowitzki shot nearly as well as Parsons and finished with 21 points (8-12 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and four rebounds. He struggled to only 10 points (2-10 FG) on Friday against the Suns, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Ellis had 19 points (7-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and four assists as the third member of the starting lineup to reach double figures. In only five minutes off the bench, Richard Jefferson was able to go a perfect 4-4 from the field and 2-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 10 points. It was good enough to lead the bench in scoring.The Bucks had all five starters reach double figures in points, but just didn't play enough defense to keep them close. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the team with 18 points (8-11 FG, 2-3 FT) and four rebounds. It was the most points he's had in the last seven games, so the Bucks will hope it can boost his confidence even more. Brandon Knight had 16 points of his own, but did most of his damage from the free throw line where he went a perfect 7-for-7. He's done most of the scoring for the Bucks in the last two weeks, and it looks like it may continue. Rookie Jabari Parker shot 7-for-12 from the field to score 15 points, while also chipping in five rebounds. He's now averaging 12.4 points and 5.9 rebounds on the year. Zaza Puchulia gave a good push off the bench and fnished with 13 points and eight rebounds.     The Mavericks' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday, while the Bucks will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Tuesday. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Milwaukee,Bucks,American Airlines Center,11,11,16,6,10.0,29.0,44.0,79.0,15.0,19.0,36.0,29.0,11.0,4.0,15.0,40.0,82.0,14.0,16.0,36.0,17.0,17.0,Chandler Parsons,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,28.0,11.0,14.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,30,Giannis Antetokounmpo,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Dirk Nowitzki,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,25,Jabari Parker,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,36,Tyson Chandler,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Larry Sanders,9.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Monta Ellis,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,28,O.J.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (16-4) defeated the New York Knicks (4-18) 103-99 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York.Despite out-scoring the Blazers 24-20 in the fourth quarter and nearly making a late comeback, the Knicks came up just short and suffered a tough four-point loss. The Knicks shot 52 percent from the field compared to the Blazers who shot only 42 percent, but were unable to do the little things as they were both out-rebounded and forced into more turnovers than their opponent. This marks the fourth straight victory for the Blazers and eigth straight loss from the Knicks. The superstar duo of LaMarcus Aldridge and Damian Lillard was too much for the Knicks. Aldridge finished with 24 points (9-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-8 FT) and 11 rebounds, giving him his seventh double-double in the last eight games. He's now averaging 22.2 points and 9.8 rebounds on the season. Lillard on the other hand had 20 points (5-16 FG, 2-8 3Pt) of his own. He was able to get to the free throw line nine times and converted on eight of those attempts. He's combined for 43 points in the last two games, pushing his season averages to 19.9 points and 6.5 assists. Wes Matthews was also huge for the Blazers, as he went 5-for-11 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 18 points. After a tough shooting outing against the Pacers on Thursday, it was good to see him get back on track. Nicolas Batum chipped in 11 points and seven assists. Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks with 23 points (9-19 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and 10 rebounds. It was his first double-double of the season, and he's now combined for 55 points and 17 rebounds in his previous two games. The Knicks also received a huge contribution from J.R. Smith. He went 8-for-12 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 20 points off the bench. It was only the second time this season he's reached the 20-point mark, so if he can continue to show some offensive consistency, it would go a long way in helping the Knicks improve. Amare Stoudemire got the start at center, and had a solid outing as he recorded 16 points (7-11 FG, 2-2 FT) and 10 rebounds. It was only his sixth start of the season, but he was able to turn it into his fourth double-double of the year. The Trail Blazers' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, while the Knicks will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Tuesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (9-10) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (5-16) 104-87 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The Pelicans were able to use a big first half, where they out-scored the Lakers 50-40, to coast to a 17-point victory on the road. The Pelicans shot 52 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three-point line, while the Lakers shot only 40 percent from the floor and a meager 26 percent from beyond the arc. To go along with the superior shooting, the Pelicans also secured a 50-34 rebounding advantage, only furthering their dominance in this one.The Pelicans were led by the duo of Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. Davis went 11-for-15 from the field to score 23 points, while also grabbing six rebounds. He's been a force in the last five games, as he's averaged 26.8 points over that five game span. Holiday had 22 points of his own, as he shot 9-for-17 from the field and 4-for-5 from beyond the arc. He struggled in Monday's loss to the Clippers where he finished with only seven points, so this was a nice bounce back game for him. Ryan Anderson came off the bench for 11 points (4-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and 10 rebounds, marking his second double-double of the year. He's now averaging 14.9 points and 5.5 rebounds on the season. Both Tyreke Evans and Alexis Ajinca were the other two to reach double-digit points with 11 and 10 points respectively.Kobe Bryant struggled with his shot Sunday, as he went only 6-for-18 from the floor and 0-for-5 from the three-point. He finished with 14 points, which is nearly half of his season average. Ed Davis was able to post 12 points and seven rebounds in 29 minutes. It was the first time in 10 games he reached double figures in scoring. With most of starting lineup struggling to find any offensive consistency, the Lakers looked to their bench for help.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (2-18) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-17) 108-101 in overtime on Saturday.Philadelphia dropped their first 17 games of the season, but over their last three games, they hit a light part of their schedule and have secured two wins. The recently-signed Robert Covington scored a game-high 25 points in 29 minutes off the bench, putting up a nice game on the back of his 21-point performance against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday. Michael Carter-Williams finished two rebounds shy of collecting his second triple-double of the season, finishing with 20 points, eight rebounds and 16 assists. The Sixers will continue their road trip against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, and they might get backup point guard Tony Wroten (knee) back after he missed the last four games.Detroit is on an 11-game losing streak, and they continue to sputter on offense. They couldn't buy a bucket against the Sixers, shooting 39 percent from the field and 26 percent from beyond the three-point line. Kyle Singler, the current starter at small forward, tied his season-high with 21 points in 40 minutes. The Pistons will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday to finish off their back-to-back set. 											",Detroit,Pistons,Philadelphia,76ers,Little Caesars Arena,2,18,3,17,6.0,22.0,34.0,86.0,27.0,35.0,47.0,22.0,19.0,7.0,23.0,40.0,87.0,21.0,30.0,53.0,27.0,18.0,Kyle Singler,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,40,Luc Mbah a Moute,11.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,37,Josh Smith,8.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,23.0,9.0,18.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,47,Nerlens Noel,8.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,37,Andre Drummond,8.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Henry Sims,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,27,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,29,Hollis Thompson,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,25,Brandon Jennings,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,34,Michael Carter-Williams,8.0,15.0,3.0,2.0,20.0,8.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,44,Greg Monroe,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,33,Jerami Grant,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8,Cartier Martin,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,23,Robert Covington,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,9.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,29,Caron Butler,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,12,KJ McDaniels,6.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,32,D.J.

												The Golden State Warriors (17-2) defeated the Chicago Bulls (12-8) 112-102 on Saturday. Golden State is on a 12-game win streak, and they haven't taken their foot off the gas. While most of their recent wins came during an easy stretch of their schedule, the Warriors' handling of the Bulls put a cherry on top of their win streak. Draymond Green couldn't be stopped Saturday, putting up career-highs with 31 points and seven three-pointers. The Warriors will finish off their two-game road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday.Chicago has dropped two of their last three games. Pau Gasol did his best to keep the Bulls in the game Saturday, but it wasn't enough, despite finishing with 22 points and 20 rebounds for an impressive double-double. Taj Gibson (ankle) returned from a six-game absence and put up 12 points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes off the bench. The Bulls will stay home and host the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets (16-4) defeated the Phoenix Suns (12-9) 100-95 on Saturday. Houston has won four straight games, finding ways to win despite being without Dwight Howard (knee) and Terrence Jones (knee) for much of the season. They did get Patrick Beverley (hamstring) back from a six-game absence Saturday. He came off the bench in his return, playing 27 minutes and putting up 19 points. James Harden briefly left the bench to stretch out his back. He returned with heating pads applied to his back and was able to finish the game, playing 39 minutes and finishing with 15 points and 12 rebounds. The Rockets' next game is on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.  Phoenix has dropped three of their last five games. Isaiah Thomas missed his sixth straight game, putting the onus on Goran Dragic and Eric Bledsoe to lead the way for the Suns. Bledsoe scored game-high 23 points, but in general, the Suns couldn't buy a bucket Saturday. They shot 37 percent from the field and 25 percent from beyond the arc. Phoenix will finish off their current three-game road trip Monday against the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The San Antonio Spurs (15-5) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (4-15) 123-101 on Saturday.San Antonio has won 10 of their last 11 games. They rested Tony Parker, who suffered a mild hamstring injury in Friday's win over the Memphis Grizzlies, and Manu Ginobili (rest) for this game. While coach Gregg Popovich planned to have Tim Duncan sit out as well, the Big Fundamental insisted on playing, and he put up 13 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in 19 minutes. Cory Joseph filled in as the starter at point guard and led the way for the Spurs, putting up 18 points and five assists in 33 minutes. San Antonio's next game is on the road against the Utah Jazz on Tuesday.Minnesota has lost five straight, and the injury bug continues to infect them. Ricky Rubio (ankle), Kevin Martin (wrist) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) remain out in what seems like perpetuity, and Mo Williams was held out of Friday and Saturday's games with back spasms, leaving Zach LaVine as the only healthy point guard on the roster. LaVine did his best to step up, finshing with the first double-double of his career (22 points, 10 rebounds) in 42 minutes. It's not going to get easier for the Timberwolves anytime soon. They host the Golden State Warriors on Monday.

												The Orlando Magic (9-14) defeated the Sacramento Kings (10-10) 105-96 on Saturday. Orlando has won back-to-back games, also taking a win over the Utah Jazz 98-93 on Friday. Nikola Vucevic (back) missed a fourth straight game. Tobias Harris has taken on more of the scoring load in Vucevic's absence. He put up a game-high 27 points Saturday, after having put up a game-high 22 points Friday. The Magic's next game is Wednesday against the Washington Wizards, and Vucevic could be back for that game.Sacramento has lost five of their last six games, playing five of those without their franchise center DeMarcus Cousins. Darrren Collison finished with a team-high 22 points. Ryan Hollins has been filling in at center, but the Kings have mostly used a committee approach to replace Cousins, which hasn't gotten the job done. Cousins has been sidelined with a viral infection and is targeting a return Monday against the Utah Jazz.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (14-5) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (8-10) 120-100 on Saturday.Los Angeles has won seven straight games, coasting through arguably the easiest stretch of their schedule this season. Blake Griffin led the way with a game-high 30 points in 30 minutes. Chris Paul displayed his scoring and dishing talents, finishing with 18 points and 16 assists in 30 minutes. As a team, the Clippers shot 55 percent from the field and 53 percent from beyond the three-point line. They'll stay home to host the Phoenix Suns on Monday.New Orleans has dropped five of their last six games, reeling due to the absence of Eric Gordon, or simply a lack of cohesion on a team that is starting to appear as though it will fail to meet expectations for a second straight season. Gal Mekel made his Pelicans debut, dishing six assists in just 11 minutes of action off the bench. Anthony Davis finished with 26 points but corralled just three rebounds. The Pelicans will stay in Los Angeles to play the Los Angeles Lakers on the second game of their back-to-back set.

												The Hornets (5-15) snapped a 10-game winning streak and sent the Knicks (4-17) to their seventh straight loss with Friday’s 103-102 victory.Charlotte, which led by 14 entering the fourth quarter, allowed the Knicks to creep back into the game in the final four minutes. Back-to-back threes from J.R. Smith and Carmelo Anthony brought New York within two, and another Anthony three less than a minute later gave the Knicks a one-point advantage with 40 seconds to play. Following missed baskets on both ends, the Hornets had the ball with four seconds to play with a chance to win. The ball was inbounded to Kemba Walker, who drove into the paint and laid it in at the buzzer for his 11th point of the game.The Hornets were led by 22 points from Gerald Henderson and 16 points and 13 boards from Al Jefferson. Lance Stephenson added 16 points (7-15 FG) to go with six assists and six rebounds, and Gary Neal chipped in 13 points off the bench. The Hornets shot 48 percent from the floor but made just 22 percent of their three-point attempts (4-18 3Pt).New York got 32 points from Anthony to go with seven rebounds and four assists. The only other Knicks to score in double figures were Tim Hardaway, Jr. and J.R. Smith, who had 13 and 14 points, respectively. Smith also added five assists and four boards. The Knicks were out-rebounded 41-34 but committed only six turnovers, three of which were charged to Samuel Dalembert.Up next, the Knicks host the Blazers on Sunday.

												The Washington Wizards (13-5) easily defeated the Denver Nuggets (9-10) 119-89 at the Verizon Center on Friday.With the game comfortably in hand, the second seed in the East was able to limit their players' court time, with John Wall leading the team with only 28 minutes played. The 12 assists Wall distributed made it three consecutive games with double-digit helpers. Nene returned to action, after sitting out the previous five games with plantar fasciitis, but wasn't immediately inserted into the starting lineup. He scored eight points with eight rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench. Kris Humphries, who started in place of Nene, led the Wizards with 20 points, which came on the back of his 20-rebound performance Wednesday. Washington was scorching from the field, hitting 53 percent of their field goal attempts, compared with the Nuggets, who could manage just 38 percent conversion. The Wizards travel to Boston to take on the struggling Celtics on Sunday.While John Wall is beginning a nice little streak of double-digit assist games, he's got a while to go before he catches Ty Lawson, who extended his run to seven games with double-digit assists. Lawson added 14 points and three steals to his 10 assists. Wilson Chandler was the only other member of the Nuggets to score in double-digits, dropping 20 points in 25 minutes. Coach Brian Shaw limited Kenneth Faried's minutes yet again, keeping the Team USA member to just 18 minutes. Faried scored nine points with three rebounds in his limited action. Denver will look to reverse their slide Sunday against the Hawks, having lost their last two games.

												The Celtics (6-11) sent the Lakers (5-15) to their second straight loss with a 113-96 victory in Boston on Friday night.Los Angeles, which fell to Washington by 16 points on Wednesday, shot 41 percent from the floor as a team and was out-rebounded 54-38. Predictably, Kobe Bryant led the team with 22 points (9-21 FG) to go with three assists and three boards. Jeremy Lin rebounded from an atrocious outing Wednesday, finishing with 14 points in 19 minutes. Jordan Hill added 13 points, while Wesley Johnson was held scoreless in 26 minutes. Nick Young contributed 16 points off the bench. The Lakers trailed by 10 at the end of the first quarter but were able to cut the deficit to five at halftime. However, Boston came out strong in the third quarter, bringing the lead back to double-digits and essentially putting the game away with a period to play.The Celtics, who shot 51 percent from the floor, had all five starters in double figures, with Tyler Zeller’s 24 points and 14 rebounds setting the pace.

												The Atlanta Hawks (12-6) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (8-10) 98-75 at the Barclays Center on Friday.The easy victory extends the Hawks' winning streak to five games, with an average margin on victory of 15.2 points in those five games. DeMarre Carroll led the Hawks with 18 points, hitting a season-high four three-pointers, on just five attempts. Coach Mike Budenholzer was able to rest his starters, with no player playing over 27 minutes. Backup point guard, Dennis Schroder, scored 13 points to lead the bench unit. It was his sixth consecutive game scoring in double-digits. The German national also added four steals. The margin could've been greater had the Hawks converted their free-throw attempts more efficiently, hitting only 63 percent of their shots from the line. The Hawks host the Nuggets on Sunday.Despite looking impressive in beating the reigning champion San Antonio Spurs in overtime Wednesday, Brooklyn failed to get anything going and have now not been at .500 since Nov. 13, failing in their bid to square their ledger Friday. Brook Lopez led the way for Brooklyn, scoring 20 points with seven rebounds, but had little support, with only Joe Johnson (13) joining him in double-digits. Much like their opponents, the Nets couldn't convert their free throws, going 63 percent from the line. Not only could they not hit free throws, the Nets were an abysmal 17 percent from behind the three-point arc, hitting just three for the night. The Nets played 13 players, with only Jerome Jordan (nine minutes) playing less than 10 minutes. The Nets take on the surging Cleveland Cavaliers at home Monday and will look to steady the ship.

												The San Antonio Spurs (14-5) edged the Memphis Grizzlies (15-4) 107-101 at FedEx Forum on Friday.Coming off an overtime loss to the Nets on Wednesday, San Antonio jumped out of the blocks and were never headed after Tony Parker got the first bucket of the night. Parker scored 14 points before leaving the game due to a hamstring strain, of which the severity is unknown at this point. Tim Duncan accumulated the fourth triple-double of his illustrious career, scoring 14 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 36 minutes. Duncan also added two blocks to his impressive stat line. Danny Green's hot streak continued, pouring in 16 points, including three three-pointers, bringing his recent tally to 17 made three-pointers in his last five games. The Spurs face off against the Timberwolves back home in San Antonio on Saturday.Marc Gasol pushed through the bone bruise on his knee to lead the Grizzlies in scoring, ending the game with 28 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks. He was ably assisted by Mike Conley, who had 23 points of his own, along with 10 assists. Tayshaun Prince turned back the clock, joining Gasol and Conley with 20 points, including hitting all four of his attempts from behind the three-point line. The Grizzlies had been undefeated at home before coming up against the Spurs, and have now lost two consecutive games for the first time this season. They will try to right the ship Sunday against the visiting Miami Heat.

Baskets by Thaddeus Young and Andrew Wiggins put the Wolves up by two, but James Harden responded with a pair of free throws on the other end to tie the game. Minnesota held a four-point advantage with 48 seconds to play, but a Donatas Motiejunas jumper brought Houston back to within two, and two Motiejunas free throws 30 seconds later knotted the game at 105. With 15 seconds remaining, the Wolves had a chance to go ahead, but a Chase Budinger 21-footer bounced off the rim as time expired.Playing without Harden, who fouled out near the end of the fourth quarter, in the overtime period, Houston turned to veteran Jason Terry, whose three-pointer and two free throws gave the Rockets a 112-110 advantage with 25 seconds remaining.

Johnson finished with six points on 1-of-5 shooting on the night.Harden led the way for Houston, pouring in 38 points to go with six assists and eight turnovers. Harden converted 11-of-17 field goals and 13-of-14 free throw attempts.

												The Bucks (10-10) handled the Heat (9-9) 109-85 on Friday night in Milwaukee.It was the second victory over Miami for the Bucks this season after emerging victorious in Miami 91-84 on Nov. 16. Milwaukee fell behind early but clawed back into the game in the second quarter and held a four-point advantage at half. The lead grew to eight at the end of the third quarter, and the Bucks blew the game open in the final period, outscoring Miami by 15 in the fourth.The Bucks were led by an unlikely face in Kendall Marshall, who scored a season-high 20 points (7-8 FG, 4-5 3Pt) in 24 minutes. Brandon Knight had 13 points, five rebounds and three assists, while Jerryd Bayless added 12 points off the bench. Jabari Parker, Giannis Antetokounmpo (8-11 FT), and Khris Middleton each finished with 14 points. Milwaukee shot nearly 57 percent from the field and knocked down 9-of-16 three-point attempts.Miami got solid performances from its two stars, as Chris Bosh (21 points) and Dwyane Wade (28) combined for 49 points, nine assists and nine boards. They didn’t receive much help, though, as no other Heat player scored in double-figures. Mario Chalmers had nine points, six assists and six steals, while Danny Granger finished with seven points and five fouls. James Ennis led the bench with seven points in 24 minutes.Next up, the Bucks play host to the Mavericks on Saturday in the second meeting in four days between the two teams.

												The Orlando Magic (8-14) defeated the Utah Jazz (5-15) 98-93 at EnergySolutions Arena on Friday.Even without their best big man, Nikola Vucevic, who sat out with back spasms, the Magic eased past the struggling Jazz. Kyle O'Quinn started in place of Vucevic and scored 13 points in his 18 minutes on the court, but it was Victor Oladipo and Tobias Harris who did most of the heavy lifting for the Magic. Harris had 22 points with seven rebounds, while Oladipo had 20 points with six assists on an efficient 9-for-12 shooting performance. Orlando hit 50 percent of their shots and an equally impressive 85 percent of their free throws, which when compared to the 46 percent from the field and 62 percent from the line the Jazz shot, gives a solid indication as to why the result went the way it did. The Magic continue their road trip Saturday, taking on the Sacramento Kings.The Jazz have now lost eight straight games, after being a respectable 5-7 after their first 12 contests. Rodney Hood, making his second career start in place of Alec Burks, scored a career-high 15 points in 26 minutes and joined Derrick Favors (21 points), Enes Kanter (16), and Trey Burke (13) in scoring double digits. Favors added five blocked shots, while Burke ran the offense, distributing 11 assists. Burke is now averaging 9.0 assists in his last three games. The Jazz next play Monday, when they travel to Sacramento to try and snap their losing streak.

												The Sacramento Kings (10-9) outlasted the Indiana Pacers (7-13) 102-101 in overtime at Sleep Train Arena on Friday.The Kings held the lead for the majority of the contest, only to cede control to the Pacers in the final minute of overtime, needing a Carl Landry offensive rebound and put-back of a Rudy Gay miss with 0.8 seconds left on the clock to get the victory and snap a four game losing streak. Ryan Hollins started again in place of DeMarcus Cousins (illness), scoring eight points in 21 minutes. It was Rudy Gay and Darren Collison that led the Kings though, scoring 27 and 20 points respectively. Collison also added six rebounds, six assists and four steals. Jason Thompson played a season-high 38 minutes before fouling out, grabbing 10 rebounds in the process. The Kings now take on the Magic on Saturday and hope to continue this winning form.Rodney Stuckey played his second straight game as the starting point guard, tallying 14 points with three assists and four steals. C.J. Watson played the majority of the remaining backcourt minutes off the bench, scoring 14 points in 36 minutes, despite coming off the bench. For the second straight game, after starting at the point for the first 18 games of the season, Donald Sloan failed to get into the game. Ian Mahinmi was forced to leave the game in the first half with left foot soreness and will continue to be monitored. Indiana faces the red-hot Hawks on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (10-7) defeated the New York Knicks (4-16) 90-87 on Thursday.Cleveland has won five straight games, and they've vaulted themselves out of the early-season hole they were in, at one time standing with a sub-.500 record of 5-7. Kyrie Irving led the attack on offense, putting up a season-high 37 points in 44 minutes. The other legs of the big three finished with double-doubles. LeBron James facilitated and finished with 19 points and 12 assists in 40 minutes, while Kevin Love cleaned up the glass to finish with 11 ponts and 11 rebounds in 39 minutes. Coach David Blatt certainly hasn't shied from playing his key guys big minutes. James, Irving and Love are all averaging at least 36 minutes per game this season. The Cavaliers will try to make it six straight wins when they continue their road trip in Toronto on Friday against the Raptors.As the Cavaliers shift into a higher gear and continue their march up the standings in the East, New York continues to coast downhill, losing their sixth straight game. The Knicks have only reached the 100-point threshold once in their last eight games as their offense continues to sputter. They shot 42 percent from the field and 31 percent from beyond the arc in Thursday's loss, with Carmelo Anthony finshing with nine points on 4-of-19 shooting in 30 minutes. Amar'e Stoudemire was moved over to start at center, pushing Samuel Dalembert to a bench role for the first time this season. Stoudemire has been one of the lone bright spots for the Knicks this season. He's been healthy and productive, finishing with 18 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes Thursday. The Knicks will try to reverse their fortunes on the road Friday against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (15-4) defeated the Indiana Pacers (7-12) 88-82 on Thursday.Portland is on a three-game win streak and have taken 12 of their last 13 games, giving up their only loss in that stretch to the Memphis Grizzlies. Neither team could find the bottom of the net Thursday, with both squads shooting under 40 percent from the field and below 30 percent from three-point range. Damian Lillard scored a game-high 23 points, while LaMarcus Aldridge posted a double-double of 18 points and 13 rebounds. The Blazers will embark on a five-game road trip that begins Sunday against the New York Knicks.Indiana moved fill-in starter Donald Sloan to a bench role and installed Rodney Stuckey as the starter at point guard so that they could move Chris Copeland's shooting into the starting lineup on the wing. Copeland didn't fulfill his promise Thurdsday, shooting just 2-of-9 from the field in 20 minutes. Stuckey put up 16 points and five assists in 29 minutes, and Sloan fell completely out of the rotation, failing to see a single minute off the bench.

												The Golden State Warriors (16-2) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (8-9) 112-85 on Thursday.Golden State is on an 11-game win streak that they've collected during a particularly easy part of their schedule. Stephen Curry continues to make his bid for the MVP Award, putting up his fifth double-double of the season. He scored 19 points and dished 11 assists in 31 minutes. Klay Thompson scored a team-high 23 points, and Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes finished with double-doubles of their own. They'll face a more seasoned opponent in the Chicago Bulls on the road Saturday, giving them a real pliability test as they try to add to their already impressive win streak.New Orleans has lost four of their last five games to fall below .500 for the first time since Nov. 4. Anthony Davis continues to do his best to keep the Pelicans poised for the playoff chase. He put up 30 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes, but the team shot just 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the three-point line. Despite an impressive top-six players on their roster, the Pelicans are woefully thin on the bench, and the absence of Eric Gordon (shoulder) has impacted their ability to win games more than it should, but coach Monty Williams has been unable to find a viable fill-in on his bench. Gordon isn't returning any time soon, and New Orleans isn't going to have it much easier Saturday when they continue their road trip in Los Angeles against the Clippers.

												The Boston Celtics (5-11) defended their home court well in this game, knocking off the Detroit Pistons (3-15) 109-102 in overtime on Wednesday night at the TD Garden.Detroit pushed hard to try to break their losing streak, but in the end, it just wasn't enough. They have now lost 10 games in a row, and can't seem to find an answer. The bright spots for Detroit on this night were their big men, as Greg Monroe came off the bench to score 29 points (9-17 FG, 11-11 FT) to go with seven rebounds in 32 minutes. Andre Drummond dominated through 42 minutes of play, as he scored 27 points (12-18 FG, 3-8 FT) to go with 14 rebounds, five blocks and four steals. Brandon Jennings, who has had an up-and-down year, missed all 11 of the shots he took but dished out 12 assists.As for the Celtics, they were led by an impressive game from Jeff Green, who scored 32 points (8-22 FG, 6-10 3Pt, 10-10 Ft) to go with five rebounds. This was the type of night that Green is capable of having, and he was lighting it up from behind the three-point line. Kelly Olynyk was big off of the bench in 27 minutes, as he scored 20 points (8-13 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-5 FT) to go with seven rebounds, three assists, three blocks and two steals. While only three players scored in double figures for the Celtics, it ended up being enough, and they saw a total of 10 players score throughout the game. It was a nice win to get back into the win column for the Celtics on Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (13-5) dropped a close one in overtime to the Brooklyn Nets (8-9) 95-93 on Wednesday night at the Barclays Center.The Spurs outscored the Nets by 10 in the fourth quarter to get back into this one, but when all was said and done, it just wasn't enough. San Antonio got some solid production, specifically from Tim duncan, Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili, but the real star of the night was Danny Green. Green led the team in scoring with 20 points (7-14 FG, 6-11 3Pt), while pulling down 10 rebounds, blocking three shots and racking up two assists and two steals. Duncan and Leonard both posted double-doubles, with Duncan scoring 14 points and grabbing 17 rebounds, and Leonard scoring 12 points and grabbing 13 rebounds.The Nets were led by a ridiculously impressive night from Mirza Teletovic, who lit it up with 26 points, while also pulling down 15 rebounds. Brook Lopez also had a big night with 16 points and 15 rebounds. The Nets got an all-around effort in this win, as four players scored in double figures, with two others scoring eight points. The real key to their success was the ability to knock down long shots, as they converted 47 percent from behind the three-point line.

												The Atlanta Hawks (11-6) went on the road and took down the Miami Heat (9-9) 112-102 on Wednesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.The Hawks got some impressive production from a few of their top players, as well as one key bench player who stepped up in limited minutes. The man getting the bulk of the attention after the win, though, is point guard Jeff Teague. Teague scored 27 points (8-11 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 8-8 FT) to go with six assists, five rebounds and three steals in 34 minutes. He was on fire and got some help from sharpshooter Kyle Korver (18 points on 6-12 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT), as well as Paul Millsap (14 points on 6-12 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-3 FT). Both Korver and Millsap also chipped in six rebounds, while Millsap dished out five assists. The Hawks also got a nice boost off the bench from Dennis Schroder, who played 22 minutes and scored 16 points (6-9 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-2 Ft) with three assists.For the Heat, it was the Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers show. No other player scored in double figures in this one. Bosh had 27 points on 9-of-12 shooting from the field  11 rebounds, while Wade had 28 points (11-20 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 6-9 FT). Chalmers posted an impressive double-double and shot the ball well, as he scored 19 points (6-8 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 7-9 FT) to go with 11 assists, five rebounds, one steal and one block. The Heat could only muster up a grand total of 28 points from the other eight players who saw action in this game.

												The Houston Rockets (14-4) defended their home court, knocking off the Memphis Grizzlies (15-3) 105-96 and grabbing a statement victory.The Grizzlies came into this game with a 7-2 road record, and look like a serious contender. The Rockets were looking to spoil that, and did so while making life tough from the outside for the Grizzlies. Memphis only saw three players score in double figures\, but nine players scored at least seven points. Mike Conley led the way with 15 points (5-9 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT), six assists and three steals in 27 minutes. Both Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol had quiet nights, as both had eight points and managed just 13 total rebounds between the two.What made this win even more impressive for the Rockets, was the fact that they got it done without Dwight Howard. Howard was out with a strained right knee, but six players stepped up to score in double figures during his absence. James Harden led the way, scoring 21 points (6-11 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 7-8 FT) to go with four assists, four rebounds, three steals and one block in 28 minutes. Tarik Black, who started in place of Howard, posted a double-double with 10 points (5-9 FG), with 11 rebounds. It was an impressive, well-rounded effort from Houston.

												The Dallas Mavericks (15-5) went on the road and knocked off the Milwaukee Bucks (10-10) 107-105 on Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center.It was Monta Ellis once again who led the way for the Mavericks. After a double-overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday where Ellis scored 38 points, he led the team in scoring 23 points (11-26 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT) to go with seven assists and three steals. No bucket was bigger than his fadeaway game-winner though. Ellis has been on fire lately, but he got plenty of help on Wednesday, as six players scored in double figures. Tyson Chandler scored 18 points (8-11 FG, 2-6 FT) to go with 20 rebounds. To make the win even more impressive, the Mavs decided to rest Dirk Nowitzki on Wednesday.The Bucks just couldn't do enough to knock off the Mavericks on this night, as only three players scored in double figures. While the Bucks out-shot the Mavericks, hitting 52 percent from the field and 64 percent from behind the three-point line, it still wasn't enough. Milwaukee got an impressive 25 points from Brandon Knight (8-16 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 7-7 FT), who also put up six rebounds, five assists and four steals. Khris Middleton led the bench with 30 minutes played, and produced nicely, adding 21 points (8-13 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT) to go with eight rebounds, three steals and one block. The Bucks have been up and down all year, as is evident from their 10-10 record.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (1-17) finally broke their winless streak, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves (4-13) 85-77 on Wednesday night at the Target Center.Philadelphia must have breathed a sigh of relief after this one. They badly needed to get their first win to avoid further embarassment, and got it done against the Timberwolves. The 76ers were led by a well-rounded team effort, but specifically by Michael Carter-Williams' near triple-double, with 20 points (9-20 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-7 FT), nine assists and nine rebounds in 43 minutes. Two key players led the bench charge for the Sixers as well, with K.J. McDaniels playing 36 minutes and Robert Covington getting 31. McDaniels scored 12 points (4-13 FG, 2-9 3Pt, 2-2 FT) to go with nine rebounds, four blocks, two assists and one steal, while Covington scored 17 points (5-13 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT) to go with four rebounds, one assist and one steal.The Timberwolves are dealing with injuries galore currently, as Ricky Rubio (ankle) and Kevin Martin (wrist) are out for what will likely be another month, and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) should be out for another week and a half. This meant heavy minutes for the starters, and all five players went over 30 minutes, with four of the five playing at least 36 minutes. Gorgui Dieng was the most impressive of the bunch, as he posted a strong double-double with 15 points (6-12 FG, 3-5 FT) and 16 rebounds. Mo Williams had a solid all-around night as well, with 14 points (5-14 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 2-2 FT), seven assissts and six rebounds.

												The Toronto Raptors (15-4) went into Utah and took down the Jazz (5-14) 123-104 on Wednesday night at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City.The Raptors got the job done, even without the injured DeMar DeRozan. Led by another impressive performance from point guard Kyle Lowry, Toronto continued their incredibly impressive year. Lowry scored 39 points (13-22 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 9-9 FT) to go with five rebounds, four assists and one steal in 38 minutes. He had a monster game, but Lowry had a bit of help as well. In total, six players scored in double figures for the Raptors, including four starters, while Jonas Valanciunas had nine points. Toronto showed how well-rounded they are in this win, and that they're a team to be feared.The Jazz have taken some tough losses to this point, but they were just outplayed in the first half and couldn't manage to get back into it during the second half. They did see six players score in double figures, with Enes Kanter and Derrick Favors leading the way. Both Kanter and Favors had 19 points, and combined, they brought in 15 rebounds. The offense was spread out nicely, but after falling behind 69-53 at halftime, it was too much to overcome. The Jazz will look to bounce back at home against the Orlando Magic on Friday night.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (13-5) defended home court on Wednesday, taking down the Orlando Magic (7-14) 114-86 at the Staples Center.The Magic were forced to play another game without big man Nikola Vucevic (back) on Wednesday night. Kyle O'Quinn got the start in Vucevic's place, but played just seven minutes and scored six points (3-3 FG) with one rebound and one steal. Orlando simply couldn't get anything going, regardless of who was on the floor, as 11 players saw at least 12 minutes of action in Wednesday's loss. Tobias Harris led the way for the Magic, scoring 16 points (7-11 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 0-1 FT) to go with eight rebounds and two steals in 25 minutes. Orlando will turn their attention to the Utah Jazz on Friday night.For the Clippers, they were simply hitting on all cylinders. They shot 54 percent from the field, and had five players score in double figures. Chris Paul had a double-double with 19 points (7-10 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), 10 assists, five rebounds and one steal in 29 minutes. Blake Griffin had an impressive stat line as well, with 21 points (9-16 FG, 3-4 FT), eight rebounds, six assists, two steals and one block in 29 minutes. Los Angeles has won six games in a row, and they're doing everything possible to keep pace with the Golden State Warriors in the division.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (9-7) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (10-9) 111-108 on Tuesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.The Cavaliers were able to pull out the three-point victory at home, after going into the fourth quarter all tied up with the Bucks. Despite turning the ball over 19 times, Cleveland was able to shoot 53 percent from the field compared to Milwaukee, who shot 49 percent, giving them just enough of an advantage to come away with the victory.The Cavs big three came out in full force on Tuesday, combining to score 81 of the teams 111 points. Kyrie Irving shot 10-for-15 from the field and 8-for-10 from the free throw line to score 28 points, while also handing out six assists. He was very efficient in this one, as the Bucks just couldn't find an answer. Kevin Love finished with 27 points (10-16 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and 10 rebounds, just one game after recording 28 points and 10 rebounds against the Pacers. Love has notched two double-doubles in as many games and has eight on the season. LeBron James didn't have his best shooting performance from the field, but he was still able to get to the free throw line 21 times, while converting on 14 of those attempts. He scored 26 points and had 10 assists in 41 minutes.The Bucks were kept close by the duo off Brandon Knight and Jabari Parker. Knight shot 10-for-18 from the field and 5-for-9 from the three-point line, giving him 27 points and eight assists on the night. After struggling in the Bucks' last few matchups, it was a nice bounce back game for Knight. Parker was also very efficient from the floor, and went 11-for-15 from the field to finish with 22 points and eight rebounds. He's now scored a combined 42 points in his last two games and is averaging 11.9 points and 6.1 rebounds on the year. Giannis Antetokounmpo and O.J. Mayo were the only other Bucks to reach double figures in points, as they both contributed 14 of their own.   The Cavaliers' next game will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Thursday, while the Bucks will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (10-6) defeated the Boston Celtics (4-11) 109-105 Tuesday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.The Celtics had a big first half, out-scoring the Hawks 66-50, but were unable to keep their momentum going into the third quarter, and allowed the Hawks to come all the way back and take the victory. Despite being out-rebounded 42-31, the Hawks were still able to force the Celtics into 23 turnovers, giving them enough of an advantage to grab a four-point victory.Kyle Korver was almost impossible to stop in this one. He shot a ridiculous 8-for-9 from the floor and 6-for-7 from beyond the arc to finish with a team-high of 24 points. Considering he's averaging 12.9 points on the year, it was a nice surprise for the Hawks to get some extra offensive production out of Korver. Paul Millsap played a big role in the win as well, as he recorded 19 points, six rebounds and seven assists. The seven assists were a season-high for Millsap, as he came into this game averaging just 3.2. Al Horford was the other starter for the Hawks to reach double-digit points. He finished with 16 points and six rebounds. Horford's scoring average is way down from the last two seasons, but this game offered a step in the right direction, and will hopefully give him some confidence for the future.Despite the loss, Jeff Green had a solid offensive outing. He shot 10-for-16 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score 25 points in 35 minutes. Green has really struggled from the three-point line in the past two weeks, but has still been able to keep his season scoring average at 18.1 points per game. Jared Sullinger had an efficient game. He scored 22 points (9-16 FG, 4-7 3Pt) and grabbed nine rebounds in 29 minutes. After struggling against the Spurs on Sunday, it was a nice confidence builder for Sullinger. Rajon Rondo struggled with his shot all night and finished with only two points. He did all of the other things right though and contributed a ridiculous 19 assists and 12 rebounds. The 19 assists and 12 rebounds were both season-highs for Rondo.The Celtics' next game will at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, while the Hawks will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (5-13) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-15) 106-96 on Tuesday.Los Angeles has won their last two games, defeating the Toronto Raptors 129-122 in overtime Sunday before going on the road to beat the Pistons. Kobe Bryant had a dubious triple-double to encore the 31-point, 11-rebound and 12-assist line he put up Sunday. Bryant finished with 12 points, 13 assists and 10 turnovers Tuesday. His barrage of assists have been accompanied by wins for the Lakers, but Bryant has put on passing clinics in small stretches before that faded quickly in the past, indicating that he will likely regress back to being more of a scoring threat than a facilitator most nights. The Lakers have two more games on their road trip, and they'll finish a back-to-back set Wednesday when they go to Washington to take on the Wizards.Detroit has dropped nine straight games. Over their last two contests, they've used Greg Monroe off the bench and shifted Josh Smith to power forward so they could add an extra shooter on the wing. Kyle Singler has started at small forward both gmes, but after he played just 17 minutes Tuesday, it appears his hold on the job may not be too tight. While defense isn't the Lakers' forte, they were successful in limiting the Pistons to 37 percent shooting from the field and 29 percent from beyond the arc. Detroit is playing a back-to-back set, and they'll travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (7-9) defeated the New York Knicks (4-15) 98-93 on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.Despite being out-scored 29-21 in the final quarter, the Nets were able to hold on to a five-point victory and push the Knicks losing streak to five straight games. Brooklyn was able to secure a 49-40 rebound advantage in this one, as the Knicks couldn't handle the Nets' bigs.Brook Lopez led all scorers Tuesday. He scored 23 points (10-20 FG, 3-4 FT) and grabbed eight rebounds, pushing his season averages to 15.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. Joe Johnson stuffed the stat sheet as well. He finished with 22 points, eight rebounds, six assists and three steals. Johnson was able to go a perfect 7-of-7 from the free throw line, as he led the team in attempts. The third starter to reach double figures was Deron Williams. Williams shot 6-for-12 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score 19 points. He had a brutal game shooting the ball against the Bulls on Sunday, so it was good to see him have a bounce back game. Coming off the bench, Mason Plumlee chipped in 10 points and eight rebounds.Carmelo Anthony had a tough day from the field. He shot 7-for-22 from the floor and a dismal 1-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 20 points. He also tied a season-high with nine reobounds, while chipping in six assists. Jose Calderon on the other hand caught on fire a bit in this one. He shot 7-for-9 from the field and 5-for-6 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also recording seven assists. It was only the second time he's reached double figures in points, although he's only participated in six games this year. Amare Stoudemire was moved into the starting lineup, and had a solid all-around game. He scored 17 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 37 minutes on the floor. The Knicks bench didn't give them much of a boost.The Nets' next game will be at home against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, while the Knicks will play at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (14-5) defeated the Chicago Bulls (11-7) 132-129 in a double overtime thriller at the United Center on Tuesday.With just under 40 seconds to go in the second overtime, Monta Ellis was able to hit a clutch three-pointer for the Mavericks, giving them their fourth straight victory. The Mavericks were outstanding from beyond the arc Tuesday as they shot 50 percent from deep compared to only 31 percent from the Bulls.The three-point shot for the victory wasn't all Ellis did for the Mavs on Tuesday. He was able to score a season-high of 38 points (16-35 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 5-5 FT) and has now combined for 86 points in his last three outings. Dirk Nowitzki had a big game as well. He finished with 22 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists, coming up just short of a triple-double. Nowitzki is now averaging 19.4 points and 5.7 rebounds on the year. Chandler Parsons came out shooting and went 7-for-16 from the field and 3-for-7 from the three-point line to score 24 points, while also adding seven rebounds. It was his first time reaching the 20-point mark in the last six games. Coming off the bench, Devin Harris was very efficient. He went a perfect 6-for-6 from deep to give him 20 points, but also handed out eight assists in arguably his best game of the season.The Bulls were led by Pau Gasol who scored 29 points and contributed 14 rebounds. It was his fourth straight double-double and tenth on the year. He has combined for 54 points and 27 rebounds in his last two games as he continues to put together a solid season. Jimmy Butler continued to score in bunches as he finished with 23 points. Butler also had eight rebounds and seven assists, while playing 46 minutes for the Bulls. Mike Dunleavy was the other Bull to reach the 20-point mark. With a season average of only 9.8 points per game, the Bulls got a nice extra boost from him in this one. Derrick Rose chipped in a double-double of his own, as he shot 6-for-20 from the field and 4-for-11 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while adding 10 assists.The Mavericks' next game will be on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, while the Bulls will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday.   											",Chicago,Bulls,Dallas,Mavericks,United Center,14,5,11,7,,,,,,,,,,15.0,30.0,47.0,102.0,23.0,27.0,46.0,30.0,14.0,Mike Dunleavy,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,8.0,15.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,48,Chandler Parsons,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,16.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,44,Pau Gasol,14.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,12.0,25.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,50,Dirk Nowitzki,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,22.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,42,Joakim Noah,14.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,36,Tyson Chandler,14.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,39,Jimmy Butler,8.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,21.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,46,Monta Ellis,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,38.0,16.0,35.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,45,Derrick Rose,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,20.0,4.0,11.0,7.0,36,Jameer Nelson,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,23,Nikola Mirotic,4.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,25,Brandan Wright,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Kirk Hinrich,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,26,Devin Harris,4.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,10.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,35,Aaron Brooks,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Al-Farouq Aminu,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Tony Snell,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,J.J.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (8-8) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (5-13) 112-104 Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Pelicans had a big first half in this one, out-scoring the Thunder 69-52. Despite a second half attempt at a comeback, the Pelicans were able to hold their ground and spoil the return of Kevin Durant, who played in his first game of the season after sitting out with an injury for the beginning of the year.Although he wasn't able to bring the Thunder a win, Kevin Durant came back and didn't show much rust at all, even after missing so many games. He shot 9-for-18 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line to score 27 points in 29 minutes. He also got to the line seven times and converted on six of those attempts. The Thunder's other superstar, Russell Westbrook, didn't have his best shoting performance. He went 6-for-20 from the floor and 1-for-4 from beyond the arc to score 21 points. Westbrook recorded six rebounds and seven assists, but had an uncharacteristic seven turnovers as well. The other three members of the Thunder's starting lineup combined for only eight points, which will make it tough for any team to get a win. Reggie Jackson and Jeremy Lamb did have solid games off the bench though, with 17 and 15 points respectively.The Pelicans were led by Anthony Davis, who had 25 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks. He was able to get to the line a wopping 16 times, but converted on only nine of those attempts. The double-double was also his fourth in the last five games. Ryan Anderson had a double-double of his own off the bench. He finished with 23 points and 11 rebounds, with the rebounding total being a season-high for the forward. Tyreke Evans led all scorers in this game with 30 points. He was able to get off 24 shots, while converting on 14 of them. It was a season-high for Evans, after coming off a four-point performance on Saturday. The fourth Pelican to reach double figures was Jrue Holiday. Holiday had a great game and finished with 16 points and 10 assists. He made it a point to get everyone involved in this one.The Pelicans' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Thursday, while the Thunder will travel to Philadelphia to play the 76ers on Friday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (14-4) defeated the Denver Nuggets (9-9) 105-103 on Tuesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.The Nuggets went into the fourth quarter with an 85-78 point lead, looking as if they could knock off the outstanding Trail Blazers. But the Nuggets were unable to get enough scoring production in the final quarter and were out-scored 27-18 to suffer a tough two-point defeat.LaMarcus Aldridge continued to be a force for the Blazers, as the Nuggets didn't have an answer. Aldridge went off for 39 points (16-30 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 7-9 FT) and 11 rebounds, giving him his fifth double-double in the last six games. He's also combined for 83 points in the previous three outings, exemplifying just how hot Aldridge is at the moment. Damian Lillard also had a productive night, despite only shooting 1-for-5 from the three-point line. He scored 17 points and six assists, as he didn't have to do much else with the production Aldridge had. Wes Matthews also couldn't seem to find his three-point stroke, as he went a dismal 1-for-10 from deep, but still contributed 15 points. Steve Blake, who's been a big contributor off the bench all season, continued to play well and went a perfect 5-for-5 from the field and 3-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 13 points in the comeback victory.The Nuggets continued to rely on Ty Lawson for their offensive production. Lawson shot well on Tuesday, going 9-for-16 from the floor and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 24 points. He also had 13 assists, giving him his eigth double-double in the last nine games. Arron Afflalo and Wilson Chandler both chipped in 18 points. Chandler recorded 10 rebounds as well, notching his second double-double of the season, while Afflalo added four assists. J.J. Hickson was the only other Nuggets' player to reach double figures, as he had 11 points in 30 minutes. Despite the contract extension in the offseason, Kenneth Faried has yet to make a big impact and had only eight points and five rebounds against the Blazers.The Blazers' next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday, while the Nuggets will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Friday.

												The Phoenix Suns (11-8) defeated the Indiana Pacers (7-11) 116-99 Tuesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix.Phoenix caught fire in the second half of this matchup against the cross-conference Pacers. After going into halftime down two, the Suns out-scored Indiana 62-43 in the final two quarters to give them an 18-point victory in front of their home crowd. Phoenix was able to shoot 48 percent from behind the three-point line, while the Pacers finished at just 31 percent.The Suns starting backcourt did most of the damage in this one, combining for 61 points. Goran Dragic shot 11-for-15 from the field and 5-for-6 from beyond the arc to score 34 points. He was also a perfect 7-for-7 from the free throw line in what looks to have been his best game of the season up until this point. Eric Bledsoe was the other member of the backcourt, as he finished with 27 points (11-20 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and seven assists. It was a season-high in scoring for Bledsoe, who now averages 15.3 points on the year. Both Markief Morris and Gerald Green also hit double figures in points. Morris recorded 15 points and six rebounds, while Green had 15 points and two assists. Green continues to be a bright spot off the bench for the Suns, as he's averaging 14.4 points per game.Indiana just couldn't close this game out. Roy Hibbert posted his fifth double-double, finishing with 15 points and 10 rebounds. He hadn't played since November 22nd, so it was good to seem him back on the court. David West continued to work his way back into game shape in only his third game of the season. He chipped in 10 points (5-12 FG) and six rebounds, and will only continue to get more comfortable as he gets more games under his belt. The Pacers bench had a solid amount of production, with C.J.

												The Toronto Raptors (14-4) defeated the Sacramento Kings (9-9) 117-109 Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.After losing two straight, the Raptors were able to get back on the right track and take a victory over the Kings on Tuesday. After starting the season looking like playoff contenders, the Kings have lost three straight now, and will need to turn it around if they want even a hint of the playoffs coming out of the Western Conference.Both Kyle Lowry and Terrence Ross had big games for the Raptors. Lowry shot 10-for-21 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score 27 points, while also adding 13 assists. He's now gone three straight games scoring at least 25 points, pushing his season scoring average to 19.2 points per game. Ross on the other hand found his stroke as well and recorded 20 points (8-15 FG, 4-8 3Pt) and four rebounds. It was his second game in a row with 20 points, after not reaching it once previously in the season. Coming off the bench, James Johnson was extremely efficient. He shot 9-for-13 from the floor and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 19 points. It was a season-high for Johnson, who also had seven rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas came two rebounds short of a double-double with 15 points and eight rebounds, while Patrick Patterson had 12 points as well.With DeMarcus Cousins still sidelined, the Kings were again without their best player. Ben McLemore and Rudy Gay did everything they could to keep the Kings in it, but it just wasn't enough. McLemore led the team with 21 points, after shooting 8-for-17 from the field and 1-for-5 from beyond the arc. Gay had 20 points of his own, but also chipped in a season-high of 10 assists, giving him his second double-double of the year. With three of the starters scoring four points or less, the bench played a big part. In only 14 minutes off the bench, Derrick Williams was able to score 18 points and grab four rebounds, as he went a quick 8-for-12 from the floor. Reggie Evans and Ramon Sessions added 10 and 15 points of their own, but the Kings still fell short at home.The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, while the Kings will be at home against the Pacers on Friday.

												The Golden State Warriors (15-2) defeated the Orlando Magic (7-13) 98-97 Tuesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland.With the game tied at 95-95, Tobias Harris was able to hit a jumper to put the Magic up by two. Steph Curry had something to say about it though, as he drained a three-pointer for the go ahead bucket with under 10 seconds left, thus giving the Warriors a share of the Western Conference lead and victory number 10 on their current win streak.The ""Splash Bros"" did it again for the Warriors, as Curry and Klay Thompson led the team in scoring. Curry went 8-for-17 from the floor and 3-for-9 from the three-point line to scored 22 points, while adding five assists. Thompson shot 8-for-16 from the field and 4-for-8 from beyond the arc to post 20 points of his own, while also adding five assists. They continue to be one of the most dangerous duos in the NBA. Harrison Barnes chipped in his second double-double of the season, as he contributed 14 points and 12 rebounds. He's now averaging 11.1 points and 6.2 rebounds on the year. The other two Warriors to reach double figures were Draymond Green, who had 11 points and seven rebounds, and Marreese Speights, who had 12 points off the bench.The Magic got most of their production from guard Victor Oladipo. He shot extremely well, going 10-for-14 from the field and 3-for-4 from behind the arc to score 27 points. It was a season-high in points for him. Center Kyle O'Quinn had his best game of the year as well, despite playing in only five up until this point. He scored 21 points (9-16 FG) and had 11 rebounds, giving him his first double-double of the season. Tobias Harris was able to hit a clutch jumper near the end of the game, but was trumped by Curry, who hit the game winner. Harris had a solid outing though, going 6-for-14 from the field and 5-for-5 from the free throw line to score 17 points. He also had seven rebounds and five assists. The only other Magic player to reach double figures was Evan Fournier, who scored 10 points.The Warriors' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday, while the Magic will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Wednesday.

Philadelphia out-scored San Antonio 57-48 in the second half, but couldn't complete the comeback, as the Spurs were able to hold on for the win.Kawhi Leonard took full responsibility on the offensive side of the ball for the Spurs with the two superstars sitting out. Leonard shot 9-for-15 from the field and 2-for-6 from beyond the arc to score 26 points. He was also able to grab 10 rebounds, giving him his fifth double-double of the season.

												The Washington Wizards (11-5) defeated the Miami Heat (9-8) 107-86 on Monday at the Verizon Center in Washington.The Miami Heat really struggled to get in a rhythm in this one. They shot a dismal nine percent from the three-point line, while the Wizards got hot and shot 53 percent from beyond the arc. Washington was also able to out-rebound the Heat 42-33 giving them numerous second-chance opportunities and an advantage the Heat couldn't match.The Wizards got another unexpected performance from Rasual Butler off the bench Monday. He shot 8-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 23 points in 33 minutes. The points matched a season-high for Butler, who's now scored 23 in two out of the last three games. John Wall was also big for the Wizards, as he scored 18 points, and handed out 13 assists. It was his ninth double-double of the season and he's now averaging 18.1 points and 9.1 assists on the season. Marcin Gortat notched a double-double of his own, as he recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds. It was his fourth in the last five games, as he was a big reason the Wizards finished with the rebounding advantage over the Heat. Despite most of the team struggling, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade continued to stay consistent for the Heat. Bosh scored 21 points (9-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-5 FT) and grabbed eight rebounds, giving him his sixth straight game reaching the 20-point mark. Wade shot 9-for-13 from the field and scored 20 points, without taking a three-pointer in 28 minutes of game action. In his second game back in the lineup after returning from injury, he again looked as if he's past the injuries that's hampered him throughout the early part of the season. The only other player to reach double figures in scoring for the Heat was Mario Chalmers, who came off the bench for 11 points in 30 minutes. The team was a combined 2-for-22 from behind the three-point, which would be tough for any team to overcome. The Wizards' next game will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, while the Heat will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday. 											",Washington,Wizards,Miami,Heat,Capital One Arena,9,8,11,5,10.0,19.0,38.0,68.0,19.0,24.0,40.0,29.0,12.0,2.0,21.0,33.0,70.0,18.0,28.0,28.0,12.0,11.0,Paul Pierce,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,19,Luol Deng,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,23,Kris Humphries,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Shawne Williams,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,19,Marcin Gortat,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,26,Chris Bosh,8.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,21.0,9.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,33,Bradley Beal,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,16,Dwyane Wade,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,27,John Wall,5.0,13.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,6.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,31,Norris Cole,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Rasual Butler,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,14.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,32,Mario Chalmers,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,30,Otto Porter Jr.,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,23,Josh McRoberts,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,24,Drew Gooden,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,20,Shabazz Napier,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,24,Kevin Seraphin,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,James Ennis III,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,14,Andre Miller,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Udonis Haslem,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12

												The Denver Nuggets (9-8) defeated the Utah Jazz (5-13) 103-101 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.After going into halftime down 62-43, the Jazz came out firing in the third quarter, out-scoring the Nuggets 34-21 and closing the gap to just six points. After the Jazz were able to tie the game late in the fourth, Ty Lawson hit a go-ahead bucket with just under 30 seconds left. The Nuggets then had a huge block on the defensive side of the ball by Timofey Mozgov, while Darrell Arthur clinched the victory with two free throws on the other end.The Nuggets had seven players reach double figures in scoring, as they grabbed a solid team-effort win. Lawson was the leader on Monday with 15 points (6-15 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-5 FT) and 12 assists. It was his fifth double-double in a row and seventh in the last eight games, as he continues to go on a tear for the Nuggets. Wilson Chandler had 15 points (6-13 FG, 3-7 3Pt) of his own, while also adding four rebounds. He's now averaging 12.9 points and 5.9 rebounds on the year. Coming up huge for the Nuggets was Timofey Mozgov. Mozgov recorded his fifth double-double of the year, as he finished with 10 points (5-5 FG) and 10 rebounds in 28 minutes. He was a big reason Denver was able to sneak this one out, including his block in the final minute.Gordon Hayward did all he could to keep the Jazz in a position to steal a victory. Hayward shot 7-for-18 from the field and 3-for-6 from beyond the arc to score 25 points. He also got to the free throw line eight times, and converted on all eight attempts. Alec Burks had a big game, and finished with 22 points (7-15 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 8-10 FT), along with eight rebounds. The 22 points matched a season high for Burks, who's averaging only 12.8 points on the year. Enes Kanter was able to record 17 points and 15 rebounds. He helped the Jazz take a 48-39 rebounding advantage, which still wasn't enough to push past the Nuggets. Trey Burke was the other Jazz player to reach double-digit points, as he finished with 18.   The Nuggets' next game will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, while the Jazz will be at home aganist the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (12-4) defeated the Boston Celtics (4-10) 111-89 on Sunday.San Antonio had five players score in double digits, including Danny Green, who paced the team with 18 points in 35 minutes. Tiago Splitter missed his 14th straight game. Despite Splitter's absence, the Spurs have strung together a seven-game win streak. They'll continue their road trip in Philadelphia on Monday against the Sixers.Boston has dropped four straight and seven of their last eight games. Coach Brad Stevens opted for a change at center to try and mix things up. Kelly Olynyk was moved to a bench role in favor of starting Tyler Zeller. It's unknown if this change is merely to get a point across to Olynyk or if Stevens is considering using Zeller there for the foreseeable future. Zeller put up seven points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes, while Olynyk put up three points and three rebounds in 25 minutes. The Celtics' next game is on the road in Atlanta on Tuesday against the Hawks.

Detroit battled back to trim the deficit to five points but the Warriors closed on a 10-1 run to lead 53-40 at half. From then on, the margin never returned to single-digits, with the lead reaching 22 points midway through the third quarter.The Warriors were led by 16 points and 10 assists from Stephen Curry. Klay Thompson had 15 points, while Draymond Green added a game-high 20 to go with six rebounds. Speights chipped in 11 points and 12 rebounds off the bench, and Shaun Livingston finished with 12 points in 23 minutes.It was another night of poor shooting (36%) for the Pistons, losers of eight straight, as Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the only starter to make at least half of his shots. The second-year guard finished with 22 points and six assists, while backcourt mate Brandon Jennings added 23 points.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (15-2) defeated the Sacramento Kings (9-8) 97-85 on Sunday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.The Grizzlies came out and had a great first half against the Kings. They were able to out-score them 58-42, allowing them to coast to their fifth straight victory. The Kings were able to secure the rebounding advantage with 42 compared to the 35 of Memphis, but were forced into 23 turnovers, making it tough to get any sort of momentum in this one. The Grizzlies were led by Zach Randolph, who shot 8-for-16 from the field and 6-for-10 from the free throw line to score 22 points, while also grabbing 12 rebounds. It was his second double-double in as many games, and he's now recorded 11 on the season. Marc Gasol also had a big game, as he finished with 18 points, six rebounds and five assists. He's combined for 44 points in his last two games and is averaging 20.2 points on the season. The third member of the Grizzlies' front court, Tony Allen, had his best offensive outing of the year. He shot 5-for-7 from the field to score a season-high 13 points, but was also able to record four steals in 29 minutes. Courtney Lee and Mike Conley were the other two to reach double figures in scoring, as they finished with 11 and 10 points apiece. Without DeMarcus Cousins, the Kings had serious trouble stopping Memphis' bigs and also didn't have the scoring power to keep up. Rudy Gay did everything he could to keep them in the game. He shot 7-for-14 from the field and 0-for-1 from the three-point line to score 20 points, while grabbing four rebounds. Ben McLemore also stepped up his offensive game with Cousins' absence. He was able to score 18 points (7-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) in 41 minutes, bringing his season average up to 11.1 points per game. Reggie Evans was heavily relied upon to take up the extra minutes left by Cousins. He recorded 35 minutes, after averaging only 14 minutes throughout the beginning of the season. He took advantage of the extra time and went 7-for-10 from the field to score 17 points, and grabbbed an impressive 20 rebounds. It was his first double-double of the year.The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Kings will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday. 											",Sacramento,Kings,Memphis,Grizzlies,Golden 1 Center,15,2,9,8,1.0,11.0,33.0,70.0,18.0,27.0,41.0,16.0,23.0,3.0,13.0,38.0,79.0,18.0,28.0,35.0,24.0,12.0,Rudy Gay,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,14.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,32,Tony Allen,3.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,28,Jason Thompson,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,19,Zach Randolph,12.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,34,Ryan Hollins,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,17,Marc Gasol,6.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Ben McLemore,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,40,Courtney Lee,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,32,Darren Collison,7.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,16.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,37,Mike Conley,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,31,Omri Casspi,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15,Kosta Koufos,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Carl Landry,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,22,Quincy Pondexter,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Nik Stauskas,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,6,Vince Carter,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,14,Reggie Evans,20.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Beno Udrih,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Ramon Sessions,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9,Jon Leuer,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15

												The Miami Heat (9-7) defeated the New York Knicks (4-14) 86-79 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York.The Heat were able to give themselves the advantage, as they came out and had a strong first half defensively, while also out-scoring the Knicks 42-34. The Heat shot 42 percent from the field and 30 percent from beyond the arc compared to the Knicks, who only shot 35 percent from the field and 13 percent from behind the three-point line. After sitting out the last seven games with a hamstring injury, Dwyane Wade was finally back with the team and was given a full games worth of work. In 32 minutes, he was able to shoot 11-for-18 from the floor and 5-for-9 from the free throw line to score 27 points. He also was able to record five rebounds and five assists. The points were a season-high for Wade, so it looks as if the injury isn't still affecting him. Chris Bosh was the other big contributor for the Heat. He finished with 20 points (7-18 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and nine rebounds, coming one rebound shy of a double-double. He's been heavily relied upon for scoring with Wade sitting out, so it's good to see his scoring continue even with Wade back. The only other player to reach double-digit points was Luol Deng. He contributed 10 points and 10 rebounds. Like Wade, Carmelo Anthony came into this matchup after sitting out two games with a back injury. The injury didn't seem to hurt Anthony either, as he played 41 minutes and finished with 31 points (11-26 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 8-10 FT), eight rebounds and two assists. It was only the second time Anthony has ecipsed the 30-point mark this season. Amare Stoudemire was the only other Knick to reach double figures in points. He scored 19 of the 28 points contributed from the bench, wile also grabbing 12 rebounds. It was his third double-double on the year. The Knicks starters, minus Anthony, really struggled to get in a rhythm during this game, as they only finished with a combined 20 points. They needed more than that to give them a shot in this one.  The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Knicks will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday. 											",New York,Knicks,Miami,Heat,Madison Square Garden,9,7,4,14,3.0,21.0,29.0,81.0,14.0,19.0,49.0,13.0,11.0,7.0,23.0,30.0,72.0,19.0,31.0,41.0,20.0,14.0,Quincy Acy,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Luol Deng,10.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,37,Carmelo Anthony,8.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,31.0,11.0,26.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,41,Shawne Williams,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,20,Samuel Dalembert,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Chris Bosh,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,18.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,33,Jose Calderon,10.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,34,Norris Cole,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21,Iman Shumpert,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,24,Dwyane Wade,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,27.0,11.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,32,Amar'e Stoudemire,12.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,36,Josh McRoberts,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,25,Jason Smith,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Mario Chalmers,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,23,JR Smith,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5,Udonis Haslem,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Pablo Prigioni,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,5,Shabazz Napier,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,Shane Larkin,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,16,James Ennis III,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10

												The Orlando Magic (7-12) defeated the Phoenix Suns (10-8) 93-90 on Sunday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix. After falling behind for the first three quarters, the Suns looked to be in trouble. In the fourth quarter they came out firing though and were able to out-score the Magic 32-24, coming up just three points short of completing their comeback. Orlando was able to shoot 46 percent from the field, while Phoenix shot 40 percent, giving the Magic just enough of an advantage to sneak out a victory on the road.Nikola Vucevic continued his extremely strong start to the season. He finished with 18 points and eight rebounds, giving him season averages of 18.7 points and 11.9 rebounds on the year. Tobias Harris was another big reason the Magic were able to get the win. He scored a team-high of 21 points, as he shot 8-for-18 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line. Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier were the other two Magic players to reach double-figures. Oladipo scored 12 points (6-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt) and handed out four assists, while Fournier scored 15 points (5-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and grabbed five rebounds. With the vicotry, the Magic were able to snap a four-game losing streak and will hope to gain some confidence for the future.The Suns had a chance, but just didn't seem to get enough bench production to keep them in it. Goran Dragic led all scorers with 22 points (7-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 5-5 FT), while also grabbing eight rebounds and recording four assists. It was a solid bounce back game for Dragic after scoring only seven points in Denver on Sunday. Markieff Morris also did everything he could to keep the Suns close. He scored 18 points and contributed 10 rebounds and seven assists, giving him his fourth double-double on the year. Eric Bledsoe didn't have his most impressive night in this one, as he committed a game-high six turnovers and five fouls. He was still able to score 13 points though, while handing out six assists in the process. Gerald Green was the lone player on the bench to reach double-digit points, as he recorded 11 points in 26 minutes.   The Magic's next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday, while the Suns will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (13-4) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (4-11) 107-93 on Sunday at the Moda Center in Oregon.The Blazers had a strong sencond quarter both offensively and defensively. They were able to hold the Timberwolves to only 14 points, while also scoring 26 of their own. The Blazers were able to take a 54-43 rebounding advantage, which may have also given them exactly what they needed to pull out the victory at home Monday.LaMarcus Aldridge and Wes Matthews did most of the damage to the Timberwolves in this game. Aldridge went an efficient 11-for-17 from the floor to score 26 points, while also grabbing 15 rebounds. He's now recorded four double-doubles in the past five games, increasing his season total to seven. Matthews on the other hand shot 8-for-13 from the field and 6-for-10 from beyond the arc to score 23 points combined with six rebounds. He's now averaging 25.7 points in his last three games, as he's been on fire of late. Damian Lillard struggled from deep in this one. He was only able to hit 1-of-7 three-pointers, but still contributed 17 points and eight assists in 36 minutes. He's averaging 19.9 points and 6.8 assists on the season. Nicolas Batum was the only other Blazer to reach double-digit points with 10.Despite being questionable with an illness coming into Sunday's game, Andrew Wiggins made the start and tried to play through it. He only ended up recording 18 minutes though, while finishing with seven points. Most of the Timberwolves production came from Shabazz Muhammad and Maurice Williams. Muhammad had arguably his best game of the season. He shot 12-for-17 from the field and 4-for-8 from the free throw line to score a season-high 28 points. He hasn't reached the 20-point mark yet this season, so it was a surprise performance for the forward who benefitted from the extra time he was given.

												The Los Angeles Lakers (4-13) defeated the Toronto Raptors (13-4) 129-122 in overtime on Sunday.Los Angeles broke their four-game losing streak with this win. Seven players finished in double digits for the Lakers. Kobe Bryant led the way with a triple-double of 31 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists in 42 minutes. Nick Young put up 20 points in 31 minutes off the bench. The Lakers will embark on a three-game road trip that begins Tuesday against the Pistons.Toronto was playing their first game without DeMar DeRozan this season. DeRozan suffered a torn left aductor longus tendon in Friday's 106-102 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Friday. Greivis Vasquez stepped into the starting shooting guard spot in DeRozan's absence and put up 19 points and five assists in 34 minutes. Kyle Lowry picked up some of the slack left behind by DeRozan, scoring a team-high 29 points in 41 minutes. They've dropped consecutive games for the first time this season, and it'll be interesting to see how they keep things together with DeRozan expected to be out at least four weeks. The Raptors will continue their road trip in Sacramento on Tuesday against the Kings.

												The Dallas Mavericks (13-5) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-16) 110-103 at the Wells Fargo Center on Saturday.While the absence of Dirk Nowitzki (DNP-rest) might be looked at as a potential deterrent for the team, the Mavericks' wide array of depth was able to overcome Nowitzki's absence. Six Mavericks scored in double digits. The team's overall effort was lead by Tyson Chandler, who finished with 20 points (7-9 FG, 6-7 FT) and 13 rebounds. Monta Ellis had 18 points (6-14 FG, 6-7 FT) and five assists, and Devin Harris contributed 15 points (6-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and four assists. Despite the hard-fought defeat, the 76ers had their fair share of solid contributors. That effort was lead by Michael Carter-Williams who had an 18-point (4-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 10-12 FT, 16-assist and 10-rebound triple-double. Fellow young Philly prospect, K.J. McDaniels, had an absolutely marvelous performance as he had 21 points (8-17 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and 13 rebounds (10 offensive). The Mavericks will continue their Northern road trip by traveling to Chicago to square off against the Bulls on Tuesday, while Philly will stay at home as they'll play against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.

												The Washington Wizards (10-5) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (7-8) 83-80 at the Verizon Center on Saturday.Washington got back onto the winner's list, snapping a two-game losing streak when Tyreke Evans' game-tying three-point shot hit the front of the rim in the dying seconds. Marcin Gortat led the Wizards with 24 points and 13 rebounds, and also was a big presence defensively, blocking a season-high four shots to go with two steals. Kris Humphries started in place of the injured Nene (foot) and was a beast on the glass, pulling down 11 rebounds of his own in just 26 minutes. After starting the first 13 games of the season in place of Bradley Beal, Garrett Temple failed to get into the game, logging his first healthy scratch of the season. The Wizards take on the visiting Miami Heat on Monday.The Pelicans tried desperately to break their own two-game losing streak, but fell short, and have now lost four out of their last five contests. Emerging superstar Anthony Davis carried his team with 30 points and 13 rebounds and was joined by only two other teammates in scoring in double digits, Ryan Anderson (11 points) and Jrue Holiday (17 points). Notably, it was the first game all season that Davis failed to block a shot, as he is averaging 3.0 blocks per game. Austin Rivers got his second consecutive start in place of Eric Gordon, but scored just four points, adding three assists in his 29 minutes. The Pelicans are off until Tuesday, when they take on the Thunder in New Orleans.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (11-5) defeated the Utah Jazz (5-12) 112-96 Saturday at EnergySolutions Arena.Los Angeles extended their winning streak to four games on the back of 28 points from Blake Griffin and 22 points from Jamal Crawford in his familiar sixth man role. Crawford hit four shots from three-point range in his 28 minutes. Chris Paul handed out 10 assists, while DeAndre Jordan was a presence on the boards with 12 rebounds and blocked three shots to boot. The Clippers host the Minnesota Timberwolves back at Staples Center on Monday looking to keep their winning streak intact.Utah also kept their streak intact, losing for the fifth consecutive game, despite Gordon Hayward's game-high 30 points. Like Crawford, Hayward hit four three-pointers, but struggled yet again from the free-throw line, going 4-for-8. Hayward began the season hitting 35 of his first 36 shots from the charity stripe, but has proceeded to go 43-for-64 since. Trevor Booker was a spark plug off the bench, scoring 15 points with nine rebounds and three steals in 24 minutes, while starting center Enes Kanter struggled his way to six points and two rebounds in 18 largely ineffective minutes. As a team, the Jazz shot 45 percent from the field, compared the Clippers' stellar 56 percent, a telling difference. The Jazz host the Denver Nuggets on Monday.

												The Chicago Bulls (10-6) defeated the Boston Celtics (4-9) 109-102 on Friday.Chicago's footing came a little loose recently, as they've won just three of their last seven games, including this win over Boston. Taj Gibson (ankle) sat out a third straight game and will remain sidelined until his ankle has time to fully heal. Derrick Rose (hamstring) left Tuesday's loss to the Denver Nuggets as a precaution, but he was available Friday and  put up 21 points in 28 minutes. Joakim Noah (eye) also returned to action. He had missed Tuesday's game as well. Noah played 35 minutes and finished with a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds while also collecting six assists and six blocks Friday. The Bulls will wrap up their current seven-game road trip with an afternoon game against the Broonlyn Nets on Sunday.Boston stole a win from the Bulls on Nov. 8, but they couldn't muster the magic again. They've lost three straight games and six of their last seven. Jared Sullinger scored a game-high 23 points and pulled down 10 rebounds for a double-double. Kelly Olynyk got into foul trouble, giving Brandon Bass 27 minutes of run of the bench. Bass put up 16 points and nine rebounds in his extended minutes. Marcus Smart (ankle) is close to returning but sat out again Friday. The Celtics will host the San Antonio Spurs in a matinee matchup Sunday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (10-7) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-13) 104-88 on Friday.Milwaukee has won three straight games, and the deeper they get into the season, the more believable the Bucks' turnaround under coach Jason Kidd appears to be a sustainable change. The Bucks gave all five of the bench players they used at least 22 minutes. Ersan Ilyasova paced the team with 22 points in 31 minutes off the bench. Larry Sanders played just 11 minutes as the Bucks opted to use Giannis Antetokounmpo for stretches at center with Zaza Pachulia (personal) and John Henson (foot) unavailable Friday. They'll return home to host the Houston Rockets on Saturday.Detroit has dropped seven straight games. They were again without Brandon Jennings (sprained thumb) for a third straight game. Despite their struggles, the Pistons have watched Andre Drummond pick up his production over the last few games. Drummond posted game-highs of 26 points and 20 rebounds in 38 minutes Friday. The Pistons will stay home and host the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.

												The Dallas Mavericks (12-5) defeated the Toronto Raptors (13-3) 106-102 on Friday.Dallas has won two straight and eight of their last ten games. Monta Ellis scored a game-high 30 points in 36 minutes. Jameer Nelson (back) was held out. Devin Harris started at point guard in his place and finished with eight points and six assists in 33 minutes. Six players scored in double digits for the Mavs, including 14 points from Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. They continue their road trip with a lighter meal against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday.Toronto had their six-game win streak snapped with this loss, but more devestating was that DeMar DeRozan had to leave the game with a left groin strain after 20 minutes of action, and his status going forward is unclear. Louis Williams and Greivis Vasquez picked up the backcourt slack with DeRozan out. Williams scored 16 points in 30 minutes off the bench, while Vasquez put up 14 points and six assists in 25 minutes off the bench. The Raptors will embark on a three-game road trip that begins in Los Angeles on Sunday against the Lakers.

												The Indiana Pacers (7-9) defeated the Orlando Magic (6-12) 98-83 on Friday.Indiana has won four of their last six games despite being severely depleted by injuries. Roy Hibbert (ankle) missed a third straight game Friday, but David West (ankle) made his season debut, stepping immediately into the starting lineup at power forward. West put up 18 points and six rebounds in 24 minutes. Luis Scola moved back to a bench role with West healthy, playing 22 minutes off the bench. C.J. Watson (foot) also made his season debut, putting up nine points and four assists in 18 minutes off the bench. The Pacers will kick off a four-game road trip Saturday against the Cleveland Cavaliers.Orlando has dropped four straight games, including the first game of the six-game road trip they began in Indiana on Friday. The Pacers beat them on the boards, held them to 44 percent shooting from the field and also foced the Magic into 18 turnovers.

LaMarcus Aldridge struggled with his shot Wednesday, shooting 3-of-18 from the field, but he got work done on defense, collecting 14 rebounds and three blocks. Damian Lillard appeared to suffer minor foot injury but played through the injury and finished with 22 points in 36 minutes. Wesley Matthews scored a season-high 28 points.

												The Golden State Warriors (12-2) defeated the Orlando Magic (6-11) 111-96 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando.The Warriors got off to a hot start, totaling 65 points in the first half alone, to open an insurmountable 13 point lead at the break. It was the Warriors' seventh consecutive victory, and the second in as many nights, after defeating the Heat on Tuesday in Miami. The Warriors hit 52 percent of their field goal attempts, compared with the Magic hitting just 41 percent.Once again, Steph Curry led the way, scoring 28 points on 9-for-13 shooting, including 6-for-8 from beyond the three-point line. He is now 14-for-19 from deep in his last two games. Curry also added eight assists and five boards in another virtuoso performance, in just 24 minutes. Due to the blowout nature of the game, Shaun Livingston was able to play a season-high 27 minutes, scoring 15 points (7-10 FG, 1-2 FT) with three rebounds and five assists. It was also the first time he scored in double-digits in a Warriors uniform. Andrew Bogut, although not scoring heavily with just six points, stuffed the rest of the stat sheet, adding 12 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and two blocks in his 24 minutes. Both Marreese Speights (11 points) and Andre Iguodala (13 points) contributed off the bench, joining Harrison Barnes (16 points), Draymond Green (10 points), and Klay Thompson (12 points) in reaching double figures.For the Magic, they welcomed both Tobias Harris and Kyle O'Quinn back into the lineup, and both players performed admirably in their returns. Harris double-doubled with a team-high 16 points (6-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT), adding 10 rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes, while O'Quinn, playing for the first time since the first game of the season after suffering an ankle sprain, put up six points (3-4 FG) with seven rebounds, three assists and one steal in only 12 minutes. Nikola Vucevic also had a double-double, his seventh in succession, scoring 11 points (4-15 FG, 3-4 FT) with 13 rebounds, including seven on the offensive glass. Victor Oladipo continued to struggle to find his shot after returning from a facial fracture, going 4-for-17 from the field to register 12 points. The three steals he racked up were a season-high. Both Ben Gordon and Elfrid Payton scored 13 points off the bench, with Payton also putting up five assists in his 20 minutes.The Warriors next play Friday as they travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets, while the Magic square off against the Pacers in Indiana on Friday.

Brook Lopez was able to take advantage of Philadelphia's lackluster interior defense by having a near double-double with 19 points (9-12 FG, 1-4 FT) and seven rebounds. Besides that duo, there really wasn't a standout performer, but their defense helped keep the 76ers to shooting only 40 percent from the floor. For the winless Philadelphia 76ers, Tony Wroten helped lead the team with 18 points (6-18 FG, 6-8 FT) and 10 assists but committed eight turnovers. Henry Sims added 12 points (6-13 FG) and nine rebounds. Rookie K.J. McDaniels continued his solid start to the season with 18 points (7-15 FG, 2-5 3PT, 2-2 FT) and six rebounds. Brooklyn will go back home to take on the Chicago Bulls in a Sunday afternoon affair, while the 76ers will go back to Philly to go against the Mavericks on Saturday night. 											",Philadelphia,76ers,Brooklyn,Nets,Wells Fargo Center,6,8,0,15,9.0,24.0,34.0,85.0,14.0,17.0,42.0,23.0,20.0,8.0,24.0,35.0,71.0,21.0,28.0,40.0,25.0,24.0,Luc Mbah a Moute,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,22,Joe Johnson,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,34,Nerlens Noel,5.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,36,Kevin Garnett,9.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,28,Henry Sims,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Brook Lopez,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,19.0,9.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,29,Tony Wroten,2.0,11.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,18.0,0.0,4.0,8.0,35,Bojan Bogdanovic,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,26,Michael Carter-Williams,6.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,26,Deron Williams,8.0,10.0,2.0,1.0,17.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,37,Brandon Davies,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,21,Mirza Teletovic,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,7.0,5.0,32,KJ McDaniels,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,15.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,33,Alan Anderson,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,28,Hollis Thompson,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,28,Jarrett Jack,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,18,Drew Gordon,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,Mason Plumlee,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Robert Covington,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7,Jerome Jordan,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4

												The Dallas Mavericks (11-5) defeated the New York Knicks (4-12) 109-102 in overtime on Wednesday.Dallas was coming off of back-to-back losses heading into Wednesday's game, and a matchup against the Knicks was just what the doctor ordered.

The Mavericks will begin a four-game road trip in Toronto on Friday against the Raptors.New York has dropped two straight games, but they put up a fight Wednesday even with Carmelo Anthony (back spasms) out of action.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (9-5) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-12) 104-98 on Wednesday.Los Angeles has won two straight and four of their last five games. Matt Barnes missed a second straight game with a sore calf, giving sophomore Reggie Bullock another spot start. The Clippers committed 16 turnovers in the sloppy game, which allowed the Pistons to stay in the game. Jamal Crawford scored a game-high 25 points, and Chris Paul had 23 points. The Clippers have two more games on their road trip. They'll visit Houston on Friday to play the Rockets. Detroit has dropped seven straight games. Brandon Jennings has sat out the last two games with a sprained left thumb. D.J. Augustin and Spencer Dinwiddie are playing well at point guard in Jennings' absence. Andre Drummond had a second straight impressive game. He put up 17 points and 13 rebounds in 38 minutes Wednesday. The Pistons seem to be going away from force feeding Drummond in the post, and they're simply letting him clean up all of his teammates' mistakes, a role that he excelled in last season. They'll host the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.

												The Houston Rockets (12-3) defeated the Sacramento Kings (9-6) 102-89 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston.At the end of the third quarter, this was a tight game as the Rockets led by only four points. The Rockets were able to go on a run in the fourth quarter though, as they out-scored the Kings 25-16 to seal the victory at home. The Kings also were forced into a brutal 21 turnovers compared to only four from the Rockets, so that very well could have been the difference in this one.The Rockets were again led by their superstar James Harden. Harden was able to shoot 10-for-31 from the field and 2-for-9 from the three-point line to score 26 points, while also grabbing seven rebounds and handing out eight assists. With Patrick Beverley still sitting out with an injury, Isaiah Canaan took advantage of the start. He finished with 24 points, as he shot 9-for-16 from the field and 6-for-10 from the three-point line. Donatas Motiejunas was also in the starting lineup as an injury fill-in, with Terrence Jones sitting out. Motiejunas played well and was the third Rocket to reach the 20-point mark as he sored 21 points (10-15 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and pulled in six rebounds. Despite the victory, the Rockets' bench didn't offer much help Wednesday, considering they only contributed 16 of the 102 points.DeMarcus Cousins continued his spectacular season Wednesday. He finished the game with 29 points and 17 rebounds. It was his eigth straight double-double and and twelth on the year. With Rudy Gay still out with an Achilles injury, Omri Casspi filled in again and socred 14 points, while also contributing seven rebounds. Ben McLemore was the only other King in double figures for scoring, as he shot 6-for-17 from the field and 2-for-9 from beyond he arc to score 14 points of his own. Ramon Sessions started in place of Darren Collison at the point, but didn't contributed much as he finished with only eight points and five turnovers. The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, while the Kings will travel to San Antonio to play the Spurs on Friday.  											",Houston,Rockets,Sacramento,Kings,Toyota Center,9,6,12,3,12.0,35.0,42.0,94.0,6.0,15.0,41.0,26.0,4.0,5.0,16.0,31.0,71.0,22.0,28.0,48.0,16.0,20.0,Trevor Ariza,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,41,Omri Casspi,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,41,Donatas Motiejunas,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,10.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,36,Jason Thompson,11.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Tarik Black,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,DeMarcus Cousins,17.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,29.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,36,James Harden,7.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,26.0,10.0,31.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,37,Ben McLemore,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,6.0,17.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,37,Isaiah Canaan,6.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,16.0,6.0,10.0,1.0,31,Ramon Sessions,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,34,Joey Dorsey,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Derrick Williams,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9,Jason Terry,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,16,Ray McCallum,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Kostas Papanikolaou,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,28,Carl Landry,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Francisco Garcia,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,Nik Stauskas,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,14,Nick Johnson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Eric Moreland,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

Meanwhile, Indiana will travel to Orlando to square off against the Magic. 											",San Antonio,Spurs,Indiana,Pacers,AT&T Center,6,9,10,4,,,,,,,,,,10.0,21.0,40.0,87.0,10.0,18.0,36.0,23.0,12.0,Kawhi Leonard,13.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,36,Solomon Hill,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,28,Tim Duncan,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,17.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Luis Scola,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,26,Boris Diaw,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,33,Ian Mahinmi,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Danny Green,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,29,Rodney Stuckey,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,20.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,34,Tony Parker,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,35,Donald Sloan,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,26,Manu Ginobili,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,18.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,26,Chris Copeland,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,23,Marco Belinelli,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,CJ Miles,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,14,Matt Bonner,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,14,Lavoy Allen,9.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Aron Baynes,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,AJ Price,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,20,Kyle Anderson,,,,,,,,,,,,Damjan Rudez,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,17

												The Phoenix Suns (10-6) defeated the Denver Nuggets (7-8) in a 120-112 victory at the US Airways Center on Wednesday. The surprisingly deep Suns rotation was on display against the Nuggets, as seven of the nine active players scored in double-digits. As far as the team's starters, Eric Bledsoe lead the way with a 21-point (6-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 7-8 FT), 10-assist double-double. Bledsoe's backcourt partner, Goran Dragic, also had an excellent performance and finished with 20 points (8-13 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT), five rebounds and four assists. Suns' sixth man Gerald Green had a team-high 24 points (9-17 FG, 6-11 3Pt) in only 26 minutes. While the Nuggets go below .500 after the tough defeat, they still had a group of players that were able to make a solid impact. The most apparent of those contributing players would be center Timofey Mozgov, who had an incredibly solid 18-point (8-13 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 13-rebound double-double. Meanwhile, Wilson Chandler continues to look to break away from his start-of-the-season slump, as he had 19 points (7-12 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and seven rebounds. The Suns and Nuggets will travel to Denver to square off against each other again on Friday night. 											",Phoenix,Suns,Denver,Nuggets,Talking Stick Resort Arena,7,8,10,6,,,,,,,,,,8.0,25.0,39.0,90.0,26.0,34.0,47.0,19.0,17.0,Marcus Morris Sr.,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,31,Wilson Chandler,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,7.0,12.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,31,Markieff Morris,10.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,15.0,6.0,17.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,35,Kenneth Faried,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,29,Miles Plumlee,7.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Timofey Mozgov,13.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,18.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,31,Goran Dragic,5.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,20.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,35,Arron Afflalo,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,34,Eric Bledsoe,1.0,10.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,37,Ty Lawson,7.0,12.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,4.0,16.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,40,Gerald Green,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,17.0,6.0,11.0,2.0,26,Danilo Gallinari,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,8,Alex Len,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11,Darrell Arthur,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,17,P.J.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (13-2) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (3-12) 99-93 on Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Despite being down 51-46 at halftime, the Grizzlies were able to out-score the Lakers 34-23 in the third quarter, giving them enough of an edge to get the victory on the road in Los Angeles. The Grizzlies also out-shot the Lakers 45 percent to 41 percent from the field, which also may have given them just enough of an advantage to take the win.The Grizzlies' big three did most of the damage in this game. Mike Conley went 6-for-11 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score 19 points and hand out seven assists. It was a much needed bounce-back game for Conley, who had only seven points on Sunday. Marc Gasol also contributed 19 points of his own, while recording 11 rebounds. It was his second straight double-double and fourth on the year. Zach Randolph came one rebound short of a double-double and finished with 16 points (7-10 FG, 2-4 FT) and nine rebounds. He's now averaging 16.1 points and 11.8 rebounds on the year.In the loss, Kobe Bryant led all scorers for the Lakers. He went 5-for-15 from the field and 2-for-5 from the three-point line to score 22 points. He also got to the line 10 times, and converted on a perfect 10-of-10. Jeremy Lin was the other starter in the backcourt and managed to finish with 14 points, five assists and two steals. Nick Young continued to come off the bench since returning from injury. He shot 4-for-14 from the floor and 2-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 13 points in 27 minutes. Ronnie Price and Jordan Hill were the only other two Lakers to reach double figures in points, as each finished with 11. The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (7-5) defeated the Washington Wizards (9-4) 106-102 on Tuesday at the Verizon Center in Washington.No matter the record, games will always be close between teams of the same division. In this battle between Southeast Division foes, the Hawks stole a victory on the road in Washington. Atlanta was able to force Washington into 25 turnovers compared to only 15 of their own, which may have been the difference in this one.The Hawks were led by a big game from Jeff Teague, who shot 8-for-18 from the field and 0-for-2 from the three-point line to score 28 points. He was able to get to the line a season-high 14 times, and converted on 12 of those attempts. It was also his second game in a row with 28 points, as he continues to score in bunches. Paul Millsap did give Teague some help though. Millsap recorded his fifth double-double of the year, as he finished with 17 points (7-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-3 FT) and 11 rebounds. He's now averaging 17.7 points and 8.4 rebounds on the year. The Hawks had a great effort off the bench Tuesday, with Shelvin Mack and Mike Scott doing some damage. Mack had 13 points (5-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and five assists in only 19 minutes, while Scott scored 17 points (5-10 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and grabbed seven rebounds in 22 minutes.For the Wizards, John Wall did as much as he could to give his team a shot at the victory. Wall shot 6-for-15 from the field and 2-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 21 points, while also dishing out 13 assists. It was his eigth double-double of the season already. Marcin Gortat recorded a double-double of his own, as he scored 12 points and pulled in 11 rebounds. It was his second double-double in as many games. Bradley Beal continued to come off the bench after coming back from injury, and scored 13 points in 34 minutes. The Wizards could have used Nene Hilario in this one, but he wasn't able to play due to a foot injury.The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, while the Wizards will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors (11-2) defeated the Miami Heat (8-7) 114-97 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.With the score at 91-86 in favor of the Warriors going into the fourth quarter, it looked like a close finish was destined to be on its way. Instead, the Warriors were able to out-score the Heat 23-11 in the fourth quarter, giving them their sixth victory in a row. They were also able to shoot 57 percent from the field in this game, while the Heat struggled and shot only 39 percent from the floor.Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were a big reason the Warriors shot so well Tuesday. Curry went 12-for-19 from the field and 8-for-11 from the three-point line in a dominating performance. He finished with a season-high 40 points, while also recording seven assists and six rebounds. Klay Thompson on the other hand shot 10-for-19 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 24 points. The duo has now pushed Golden State into the second spot in the Western Conference standings. The other two players to reach double figures in points for the Warriors were Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green, who scored 12 and 11 points apiece. The bench really wasn't a factor, as only one bench player recorded over 15 minutes.With Dwyane Wade still sidelined with a hamstring injury, Chris Bosh continued to take it on himself to do the scoring for this Heat team. Bosh shot 10-for-19 from the field and 2-for-3 from beyond the arc to score 26 points, while also recording nine rebounds. Bosh has now scored 20 points or more in the past four games and is averaging 21.4 points on the year. Luol Deng also shot well, going 6-for-11 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line, scoring 16 points in 31 minutes. Mario Chalmers wasn't as successful with his shot, but still scored 14 points (4-17 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 4-5 FT) as a starter.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (8-7) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-11) 98-86 on Tuesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.The Pistons continued with their season struggles against the Bucks on Tuesday, as they suffered their fifth loss in a row and now sit at the bottom of the Eastern Conference, above only the lowly Philadelphia 76ers. The Bucks were able to out-score the Pistons 30-19 in the third quarter, setting themselves up for the victory. They also out-rebounded the Pistons 50-36, giving them even more of an advantage.The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight, who despite being questionable to play with a quad injury, took the court and recorded 20 points (7-12 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and eight assists. He's now combined for 47 points in the last two games, as he has found his shooting stroke as of late. O.J. Mayo was in the starting lineup at shooting guard for the first time this season. He capitalized on his opportunity as he shot 5-for-10 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 17 points. He's averaging only 10.9 points on the year, so the promotion into the starting lineup may have provided him some extra motivation. Larry Sanders and Jabari Parker both played well in the victory and were big reasons for the rebound advantage. Sanders had 12 points and nine rebounds, while Parker had 14 points and nine rebounds. The Bucks have been a surprise this season and will look to continue with their momentum.Despite the loss, the Pistons were led by a double-double from center Andre Drummond who scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. He has now recorded 10 or more rebounds in an impressive 11 of 14 games this season. Greg Monroe came two rebounds shy of his own double-double, and he finished the game with 15 points and eight rebounds. With Brandon Jennings sitting out, D.J. Augustin was the starter at point guard. He shot 4-for-11 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 11 points, while handing out seven assists. The Pistons' bench struggled to offer any help, as they had only 20 of the 86 total points.The Bucks' next game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Sacramento Kings (9-5) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (7-6) 99-89 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.Despite going into the half even at 49 points apiece, the Kings were able to out-score the Pelicans 50-40 in the second half to notch their third victory in as many games. The Kings were able to shoot 48 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three-point line to give them the advantage over the Pelicans, who shot 42 percent from the floor and only 18 percent from beyond the arc.Leading the Kings to the victory was the duo of DeMarcus Cousins and Omri Casspi. Cousins scored 22 points (8-18 FG, 6-6 FT), and grabbed 12 rebounds, giving him his seventh straight double-double and eleventh on the year. Casspi was in the starting lineup for the first time this season with Rudy Gay sitting out with an Achilles injury. He shot 9-for-14 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes. He's only averaging 7.3 points in 18 minutes per game this season, so the boost in playing time allowed him to surprise many with the dominant performance. Ramon Sessions was also a replacement in the starting lineup, as Darren Collison was out with a quad injury. Sessions also took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points and six assists. Coming off the bench, Ray McCallum had 12 points (4-7 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 19 minutes.For the Pelicans, Anthony Davis wasn't his normal self tonight. He struggled to post the monster line he's become accustomed to this season, as he shot only 4-for-12 from the field to finish with 14 points and nine rebounds. His output was well below his season averages of 26.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. Tyreke Evans played well on the other hand. He scored 22 points (10-17 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and added seven rebounds and five assists. The 22 points matched a season-high for Evans. Ryan Anderson was really the only other big contributor in the loss. He shot 7-for-14 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc to score 20 points. It wasn't enough of a boost to beat a tough Sacramento team though.The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Friday.

												The Denver Nuggets (7-7) defeated the Chicago Bulls (9-6) 114-109 on Tuesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.Despite starting the season 2-5, the Nuggets have now won a surprising five straight games to put them at an even .500 on the season. The Nuggets shot 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line, which gave them the advantage over the Bulls who shot only 43 percent from the floor and 33 percent from the three-point line. The Nuggets also were tougher on the boards and out-rebounded the Bulls 45-37.The Nuggets were led by their starting backcourt of Ty Lawson and Arron Afflalo. Lawson shot 7-for-16 from the field and 1-for-1 from beyond the arc to score 20 points, while also dishing out 12 assists. It was his second straight double-double and fourth in the last five games, as he continues to be a force this season. Afflalo was also very efficient Tuesday. He shot 7-for-11 from the field and 3-for-4 from the three-point line to score 19 points in 32 minutes. Starters Kenneth Faried and Timofey Mozgov both came one rebound shy of their own double-doubles. Faried had 12 points and nine rebounds, while Mozgov had 11 points and nine rebounds. Wilson Chandler marked the fifth starter in double figures for points, as he shot 6-for-11 from the field and 2-for-4 from deep to score 14 points. The Nuggets really had a total team effort in this victory.Despite getting the start, Derrick Rose again had to the leave the game early, as he was dealing with left hamstring tightness that limited him to only nine minutes. He finished with two points before leaving. Without Rose, Jimmy Butler and Pau Gasol did everything they could to give the Bulls a shot at winning. Butler was able to get to the free throw line 20 times, and converted on 18 of those attempts. He finished the game with 32 points and nine rebounds. Gasol was able to notch a double-double with 22 points and 11 rebounds. It was his seventh of the year. With Rose leaving early, both Kirk Hinrich and Aaron Brooks received extra time off the bench with each scoring 10 and 16 points respectively.The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Bulls will travel to Boston to play the Celtics on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (8-5) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (4-11) 113-92 on Monday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.Despite an even first half, the Clippers were able to out-score the Hornets 57-39 in the second half, allowing the them to seal the victory on the road in Charlotte. As a team, Los Angeles was able to shoot 51 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three-point line, compared to Charlotte, who only shot 41 percent from the floor and a meager 10 percent from beyond the arc. The superior shooting, along with out-rebounding the Hornets 43-33, gave the Clippers the advantage and put them on track for the victory.The Clippers had six players reach double figures in scoring Monday. Blake Griffin came one assist shy of a triple-double, as he had a monster line of 22 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists. He really seemed to struggle against the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday, so this was a nice bounce back game for Griffin. Along with Griffin, Chris Paul was able to contribute 22 points (10-16 FG, 2-5 3Pt), while also handing out 15 assists. The 15 assists were a season-high for Paul, and it marked his seventh double-double of the season. Jamal Crawford also continued to make his presence known off the bench, as he shot 8-for-13 from the field and 5-for-8 from the three-point line to score 21 points in 26 minutes. In the last two games, he's now combined for 40 points.The Hornets just didn't have the offensive fire power to keep up with the Clippers. Al Jefferson was one of the leaders for the team, as he finished with 16 points and nine rebounds. It was the first time in three games that he failed to reach the 20-point mark. Kemba Walker had an inefficient 15 points, as he shot only 4-for-11 from the field and 0-for-4 from the three-point line.He scored the bulk of his points at the free throw line where he went 7-for-8 on the night. Coming off the bench, Cody Zeller had a surprise offensive performance. He scored a season-high 17 points, but only grabbed one rebound in 29 minutes.The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, while the Hornets will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Cavaliers (6-7) snapped a four-game losing skid Monday, thoroughly handling the Magic (6-10) 106-74 behind 29 points and 11 assists from LeBron James.James, who was critical of his own play leading up to Monday’s contest, scored 16 points in the first quarter as Cleveland was able to force turnovers and get out in transition. Cleveland had 25 points off of turnovers on the night and out-rebounded Orlando 44-40. James did not play in the fourth quarter, while Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving were removed within the first four minutes of the final period. Love finished with 12 points (5-11 FG) and eight rebounds in 32 minutes. Irving also had 12 points to go with four assists and four steals. Anderson Varejao added 14 points and six boards. The Cavaliers recorded 30 assists on 42 field goals. Orlando, which trailed by 10 after the first quarter, received solid production from Nikola Vucevic and Victor Oladipo, but the young tandem didn’t receive much help. Vucevic finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Oladipo had a team-high 22 points and nine rebounds, but he committed five turnovers. The rest of the Magic’s starters combined for only 13 points on 4-of-20 shooting. Orlando shot just 36.3 percent from the floor had just 14 assists on 29 field goals.Up next, the Magic host the West-leading Warriors on Wednesday. Cleveland awaits a rematch with the Wizards, also on Wednesday, after Washington knocked off the Cavs 91-78 on Friday night.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (11-3) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-14) 114-104 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.Despite taking a 52-50 lead into halftime, the Sixers came out of the half cold and were out-scored by the Blazers 39-28 in the third quarter, allowing them to coast to the 10-point victory. The Sixers big men also struggled with the Blazers' bigs, as they were out-rebounded by a hefty 52-29 margin. This is the eigth straight victory for the Blazers, who now have the second best record in the Western Conference.LaMarcus Aldridge was an unstoppable force on Monday, as the Sixers' young frontcourt had no answer for him. He went off for 33 points (13-20 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 6-7 FT) and 11 rebounds, giving him his second straight double-double and fifth on the year. Fellow superstar Damian Lillard shot 6-for-11 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while also grabbing five rebounds and handing out four assists. He's now averaging 20.2 points and 6.7 assists on the year. Wes Matthews was the other major contributor on the offensive side of the ball, as he shot 6-for-16 from the field and 2-for-8 from beyond the arc to score 17 points in 32 minutes. The only other Blazer to reach double figures in scoring was Robin Lopez, who had 12 points and eight rebounds.The Sixers were led by Michael Carter-Williams, who scored a season-high 24 points, while also grabbing seven rebounds. It was his seventh game of the season after sitting out with injury, and he seems to be getting back in a rhythm. Fellow backcourt mate Tony Wroten also had a solid all-around game on Monday. He came one assist shy of his second double-double of the season and finished with 20 points and nine assists. The third Sixer who reached the 20-point mark was starting center Henry Sims. Sims finished with 22 points, which was a nice surprise for the Sixers as he's only averaging 8.5 points on the season. Coming off the bench, Nerlens Noel had 12 points and five rebounds.The Blazers' next game will be on the road in Charlotte against the Hornets on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Toronto Raptors (12-2) defeated the Phoenix Suns (9-6) 104-100 on Monday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.The Raptors were able to win their fifth straight game on Monday, as they slipped away with a four-point victory over the Suns. Despite out-rebounding Toronto 42-37, the Suns were forced into 20 turnovers, which may have been the difference in an otherwise evenly played game.The Raptors received a huge contribution from center Jonas Valanciunas, who scored a season-high 27 points, to go along with 11 rebounds. It was his second double-double in the past three games, and fourth on the year as the Suns just didn't have an answer for him. Superstar DeMar DeRozan also did his part on Monday, as he shot 7-for-20 from the field to score 23 points. He reached the free throw line 13 times and was able to convert on nine of those attempts. Coming two assists shy of a double-double, Kyle Lowry finished the game with 14 points and eight rebounds. It was somewhat of an off-game offensively for Lowry, but he was able to get his teammates involved to make up for it. Louis Williams also had a solid game off the bench considering he scored 17 points in 25 minutes.Despite the loss, Eric Bledsoe had a big night for the Suns. He shot 8-for-16 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 25 points, while also contributing seven rebounds and six assists. It was a season-high in points for Bledsoe, who was also able to convert 6-of-8 attempts at the free throw line. Markieff Morris continued his strong start to the season. He scored 17 points and grabbed eight rebounds, as the only other starter in double figures for points. The Suns had a bunch of production off the bench though, as Isaiah Thomas scored 16 points, P.J. Tucker had 11 points and Gerald Green had 13 points. It still wasn't enough to keep up with the Eastern Conference leading, Toronto Raptors though.The Raptors' next game will be on the road in Atlanta against the Hawks on Wednesday, while the Suns will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets (11-3) defeated the New York Knicks (4-11) 91-86 on Monday at the Toyota Center in Houston.With Carmelo Anthony leaving the game in the second quarter due to back spasms, the Knicks were unable to make a comeback after being down 51-46 at halftime. They were able to out-shoot the Rockets, as they went 46 percent from the field compared to the 42 percent of Houston, but with James Harden taking control in the final quarter, the Knicks weren't able to find an answer to steal a victory from the Rockets on the road.  Harden was an absolute force on Monday. He shot a ridiculous 11-for-22 from the field and 7-for-12 from the three-point line to finish with a season-high of 36 points, while also adding six rebounds and six assists. In the past three games, Harden has now scored 92 points, as he continues to make his case for this season's MVP award. Harden did receive a little help though. With Terrence Jones out for at least another three or four weeks, Donatas Motiejunas continued to take his place and scored 13 points (6-12 FG, 1-2 3Pt), while grabbing eight rebounds. Trevor Ariza was the only other Rocket to reach double figures in points as he finished with 10. He seemed to struggle with his shot though, as he went only 3-for-10 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line. Despite having three starters out with injury, the Rockets still secured the victory.The Knicks really struggled to find any offense with Anthony leaving during the second quarter. Despite playing only 18 minutes, Anthony led the team in points with 14. Jose Calderon led all other starters with nine points and five assists. He shot 3-for-7 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line in only his second game of the season since returning from injury. The Knicks did receive 49 points from the bench in this matchup, though spread out between many players. Travis Wear led all bench scorers with nine points (4-7 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) in 17 minutes. Amare Stoudemire, Shane Larkin, J.R. Smith and Pablo Prigioni all had eight points off the bench as well.  The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, while the Knicks will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers (6-8) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (10-5) 111-100 on Monday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.After coming into Saturday on a six game win streak, the Mavericks have now lost two straight games, with the Pacers being the latest to serve them a loss. The Pacers were able to shoot 50 percent from the three-point line and out-rebound the Mavericks 44-37 to help them steal the victory on the road.The Pacers win stems from a big night by Donald Sloan. Sloan shot an outstanding 10-for-14 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line to score 29 points. He also converted on 6-of-9 attempts from the free throw line, adding to his point total. It was only his second game of the season scoring over the 20-point mark. Luis Scola also was able to have a productive night against the Mavericks. He scored 14 points (4-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) and grabbed 11 rebounds. He's now grabbed double-digit rebounds in three of the last four games he's played in. With Roy Hibbert sitting out with an injury, Ian Mahinmi got his first start at center on the season and was able to post 10 points and seven rebounds. It was his second game in a row reaching double figures in points, after not scoring more than nine points previously this year.Despite the loss, the Mavericks still had plenty of offensive production from their starters. Monta Ellis shot 9-for-19 from the field and 1-for-5 from beyond the arc to score 24 points, while also handing out six assists. He's averaging 19.8 points and 4.7 assists on the season. Dirk Nowitzki also had one of his better offensive games of late. He shot 9-for-17 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line to score 22 points. He also had 11 rebounds, marking his second double-double of the season. Chandler Parsons and Jameer Nelson were also able to reach double figures in points with 16 and 10 points respectively. The team overall just didn't have their usual defensive presence to keep the Pacers from getting the victory.    The Pacers' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the New York Knicks on Wednesday.

												The Chicago Bulls (9-5) defeated the Utah Jazz (5-10) 97-95 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.Despite out-scoring the Bulls 36-22 in the third quarter, the Jazz weren't able to complete the comeback and took the two-point loss to the Bulls. Gordon Hayward had a last second opportunity to win the game with a three-pointer at the buzzer, but he wasn't able to find the magic touch that he's shown multiple times over his career. The Jazz have now lost three straight games.The Bulls were led by the duo of Jimmy Butler and Pau Gasol. Butler shot 8-for-16 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 25 points, while also recording four steals. After only scoring nine points in the previous game against the Blazers, it was a solid bounce back game for Butler. Gasol was also able to get his offensive output going. He scored 23 points (11-20 FG, 1-3 FT) and grabbed nine rebounds in 37 minutes, after returning from a calf injury that's forced him to miss games. Derrick Rose played well and scored 18 points (5-10 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 5-8 FT) in only 24 minutes. Like Gasol, it was his first game back from injury. The Bulls also had a few contributors off the bench with both Nikola Mirotic and Aaron Brooks contributing 10 points in the victory. Joakim Noah had to leave after getting poked in the eye, but was able to return later in the game.The Jazz had five players reach double figures in scoring. Derrick Favors was able to score 21 points (10-17 FG, 1-2 FT) and grab 15 rebounds, marking his sixth double-double of the season and second in as many games. Trey Burke also had a double-double of his own. He shot 8-for-14 from the field and 1-for-2 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while feeding his teammates with 10 assists. Despite the loss, Enes Kanter didn't dissapoint. He recorded a season-high 19 points and had eight rebounds in 33 minutes. Struggling tonight was Gordan Hayward, who shot a meager 2-for-11 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line. He finished with only six points, while also missing the game-winning three pointer.The Bulls' next game will be on the road against the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Jazz will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Wednesday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Chicago,Bulls,Vivint Smart Home Arena,9,5,5,10,3.0,9.0,42.0,86.0,8.0,10.0,41.0,22.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,Gordon Hayward,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,35,Mike Dunleavy,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,28,Derrick Favors,15.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,10.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Pau Gasol,9.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,23.0,11.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,37,Enes Kanter,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Joakim Noah,5.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Alec Burks,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,33,Jimmy Butler,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,25.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,43,Trey Burke,3.0,10.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,37,Derrick Rose,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,24,Joe Ingles,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,26,Nikola Mirotic,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,28,Trevor Booker,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,14,Aaron Brooks,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,23,Rudy Gobert,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Doug McDermott,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,7,Dante Exum,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Tony Snell,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,16,Steve Novak,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Cameron Bairstow,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Memphis Grizzlies (12-2) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (7-5) 107-91 on Sunday at FedExForum Arena in Memphis.The Grizzlies continued to show their dominance this season with the 16-point victory over the Clippers. Memphis was able to out-score Los Angeles 53-40 in the first half, allowing them the opportunity to coast to the victory in the second half. They also shot 49 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three-point line, compared to the Clippers, who shot only 42 percent from the floor and 28 percent from beyond the arc.The Grizzlies were led by Marc Gasol, who killed the Clippers inside with a 30-point (13-18 FG), 12-rebound performance. It was his third double-double of the season, with the 12 rebounds helping to give the Grizzlies a 52-32 rebounding advantage over the Clippers. Courtney Lee chipped in 13 points as well, shooting 4-for-10 from the field and 3-for-5 from the three-point line. With Gasol having as big of a game as he did, Zach Randolph didn't have to do as much scoring for Memphis, as he finished with only 10 points, while also adding eight rebounds. Both were below his season averages of 16.1 points and 11.8 rebounds, but he wasn't relied upon with Gasol having the hot hand. Coming off the bench, both Beno Udrih and Quincy Pondexter chipped in 11 points each to give the Grizzlies some scoring in the second unit.The Clippers saw a big game from Chris Paul, who shot 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-2 from beyond the arc to score 22 points in 34 minutes. He also had five rebounds, five assists and four steals, as he was able to stuff the stat sheet against a tough opponent. Coming off the bench, Jamal Crawford did all he could to help Paul try and keep up with the Grizzlies. He shot 5-for-13 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 19 points. He also converted a perfect 7-for-7 from the free throw line. He continues to be a very consistent offensive weapon off the bench and is now averaging 17.3 points on the year. J.J. Redick was able to contribute 15 points (5-10 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) of his own, but didn't do much else in the loss. DeAndre Jordan struggled with Marc Gasol covering him, and only posted two points and three rebounds in 20 minutes.The Grizzlies' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, while the Clippers will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Monday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (10-3) defeated the Boston Celtics (4-8) 94-88 on Sunday at the TD Garden in Boston.This was a tight finish between the Blazers and Celtics, as the game was tied going into the fourth quarter. The Blazers were able to put together the better final quarter and pull out the victory. For the complete game, Portland shot 43 percent from the field and 37 percent from the three-point line, compared to the 39 percent from the floor and 22 percent from beyond the arc that Boston shot. It gave them just enough of an advantage to slip away with the win.The Blazers were led by LaMarcus Aldridge, who posted his fourth double-double of the season. He finished with 20 points (7-21 FG, 6-7 FT) and 14 rebounds, giving the Blazers the spark needed to secure the win. Damian Lillard seemed to struggle offensively Sunday. He shot only 4-for-14 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 12 points, which was nearly half of his season average. Chris Kaman continued to play consistently well off the bench though, as he tied a season-high of 16 points. He also was able to post eight rebounds, pushing his season totals to 10.7 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. With a few players struggling to score, the Blazers did their part on the defensive side of the ball, holding the Celtics to 88 points.The Celtics received most of their production from the combination of Jeff Green and Jared Sullinger, with both scoring 19 points. Green was able to shoot 7-for-16 from the field, but only 1-for-4 from the three-point line. Sullinger on the other hand was also able to contribute seven rebounds and four assists. He's now averaging a career-high 16 points and 8.4 rebounds on the season. Rajon Rondo continued to stuff the stat sheet. He finished Sunday's matchup with 13 points, six rebounds, eight assists and two steals, but it wasn't enough to keep the Celtics in contention for the victory.

												The Miami Heat (8-6) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (4-10) 94-93 Sunday at the American Airlines Arena in Miami.Despite being down 72-67 going into the fourth quarter, the Heat were able to finish the game out-scoring the Hornets 27-21 to give them the one-point victory. The Hornets had a chance to steal the victory in the final moments of the game, but Kemba Walker wasn't able to convert on the buzzer-beater like he's done so many times before.The Heat had three players reach the 20-point plateau. Luol Deng shot a ridiculous 10-for-14 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line to score 26 points, while also grabbing eight rebounds. The eight rebounds were a season-high for Deng, despite also being relied upon heavily for his scoring. Chris Bosh posted 20 points of his own, while also adding 10 rebounds. It was his second straight double-double and sixth on the year. He's now combined for 80 points over the last three games, as he's had to step up without Dwyane Wade playing. Mario Chalmers was the other player who had a big day, as he scored 20 points and handed out 10 assists. It was his second double-double of the year and he's filled in admirably in the starting lineup with injuries keeping out a few players.The Hornets were led by Al Jefferson, who continues to have an outstanding season. He finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds, giving him his fourth double-double on the year. He's far and away the most consistent offensive threat for this team. Lance Stephenson also had a productive night on Sunday, as he tied a season-high in points with 17. He was also able to gather six rebounds and five assists. It was one of the better offensive outputs for Stephenson, who's struggled to stay consistent on that side of the ball this season. Despite missing the game-winner, Kemba Walker shot 6-for-15 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to score 16 points, while handing out four assists. He's now averaging 14.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists on the year.The Heat's next game will be at home against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday, while the Hornets will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.

												The Golden State Warriors (10-2) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (3-12) 91-86 on Sunday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.With even scoring production between the two teams in the second half, the Warriors were able to out-score the Thunder 52-47 in the first half to give them enough of an advantage to secure the victory Sunday. In what most thought would be a blowout win for the Warriors with both Reggie Jackson and Kevin Durant still sidelined, the Thunder were actually able to keep it close and nearly came out with the win.  The Thunder were led by Reggie Jackson, who came two assists shy of a triple-double. He shot 10-for-26 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line, as he finished with 22 points, while also adding 11 rebounds and eight assists. Jackson, one of the more talented of the healthy players for the Thunder, was heavily relied upon to keep them in the game. Coming off the bench, Anthony Morrow continued to offer consistent production ever since coming back from his MCL injury. He scored 16 points (5-11 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and grabbed 12 rebounds, giving him his first double-double of the season. Serge Ibaka also chipped in 16 points and eight rebounds. He's now scored a combined 54 points over the last three games, as he's done whatever he can to keep the Thunder in games.Surprisingly pushing the Warriors to victory was Marreese Speights, who came off the bench for a season-high 28 points (11-18 FG, 6-9 FT) and seven rebounds. He's only reached the 20-point mark twice this season, but he seems to be continuing to gain confidence as the season goes on. The Warriors backcourt of Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry were the other two who really helped the team fight off the Thunder. Thompson posted 20 points (6-20 FG, 4-11 3Pt, 4-4 FT), eight rebounds and five assists, while Curry had 15 points (5-15 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-4 FT), six rebounds and six assists. The only other player to reach double figures was Draymond Green, who added 10 points, while grabbing nine rebounds. It wasn't the best performance from the Warriors, but they were still able to leave Oklahoma with the victory and their tenth win of the season.The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Miami Heat on Tuesday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.

												The Denver Nuggets (6-7) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (3-11) 101-94 in overtime Sunday.Denver has won four straight games and five of their last six. After starting the season 1-6, it looked like the Nuggets were headed for the lottery again next offseason, but they righted the ship over the last week. Ty Lawson paced the Nuggets with a double-double of 18 points and 16 assists. Danilo Gallinari played a season-high 31 minutes, which is significant as he is still making his bid for a full return from knee surgery. He tied the game with 15.1 seconds left on the first of two free throws but then missed the second free throw, which pushed the game to overtime. The Nuggets return home to host the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday.Los Angeles has lost two straight games. They shot a woeful 37 percent from the field and 13 percent from beyond the arc Sunday. Kobe Bryant led the way with 27 points on 10-of-24 shooting from the field. Jeremy Lin recorded 17 points, and Jordan Hill had a double-double of 11 points and 14 rebounds. The Lakers have two days off and will then host the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (7-6) took down the Orlando Magic (6-9) 99-92 on Saturday night at the Amway Center in Orlando.The Heat were just too much for the Magic when all was said and done, as they made a nice run in the fourth to get a seven-point win. What makes the win even more impressive is that Miami did it without guard Dwyane Wade (hamstring). The Heat got plenty of production from some key players to help get the job done though. They were led in scoring by Chris Bosh, who put up 32 points (13-20 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT) to go with 10 rebounds. Mario Chalmers had a huge night also, scoring 24 points (10-16 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-4 FT) to go with eight assists and five rebounds. Miami fans have to be happy to see rookie Shabazz Napier stepping up big, as he played extended minutes (27), and scored 12 points (4-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 2-4 FT) to go with two rebounds, two steals and one assist. Miami has a quick turnaround, as they take on the Charlotte Hornets at home Sunday night.The Magic just couldn't get enough production to outscore the Heat on this night, as only three players hit double digits, with Nikola Vucevic having a monster night, scoring 33 points (12-24 FG, 9-11 FT), with 17 rebounds. Vucevic was just dominate, and grabbed 11 offensive boards on the night. The other production came from Victor Oladipo, who had 14 points (5-11 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-5 FT), with four rebounds, two assist and two steals, as well as Evan Fournier, who scored 11 points (5-15 FG, 1-5 3PT) with six assists and six rebounds. The Magic get a night off now, before taking on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday.

												The Raptors (11-2) extended their winning streak to four games Saturday, knocking off the Cavaliers (5-7) 110-93 in Cleveland.Toronto was led by a huge performance from Lou Williams, who led all scorers with 36 points (9-19 FG, 15-15 FT) off the bench. Kyle Lowry added 23 points and eight assists, and DeMar DeRozan chipped in 20 points. Toronto shot only 40 percent as a team but knocked down 38-of-42 free throw attempts. The Raptors remain atop the Eastern Conference and are the third-highest-scoring team in the league.Cleveland, which has now dropped four straight games, continues to struggle offensively and looked completely out of sorts yet again Saturday. A 13-point first quarter lead quickly evaporated in the second period, and the Raptors took a two-point lead by halftime. The Cavs’ offense continued to stagnate in the second half, allowing Toronto to blow the game open in the third quarter.Kevin Love paced the Cavaliers with 23 points and seven rebounds, while LeBron James added 15 points (6-12 FG) and 10 assists to go with a game-high five turnovers. Kyrie Irving finished with 21 points, and Anderson Varejao had a 13-point, 12-rebound double-double. Cleveland committed 18 turnovers and shot 3-of-16 as a team from beyond the arc.Up next, the Cavaliers remain home to host the Magic on Monday.

												The New York Knicks (4-10) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-13) 91-83 on Friday.New York was coming off of two straight losses, and with the winless Sixers looking for a win, this looked like it might turn into a tough game for the Knicks. Jose Calderon (calf) made his season debut and was slotted directly into the starting lineup. He finished with three points and three assists in 21 minutes. The Knicks will begin a three-game road trip in Houston on Monday against the Rockets.Philadelphia has lost 13 straight to begin the season, and while the struggling Knicks looked like a chance for the Sixers to finally secure their elusive first win of the season, the Knicks showed that they aren't quite as forlorn as the Sixers. Nerlens Noel had the best game of his rookie career Saturday. He put up 17 points and 12 rebounds in 39 minutes. The Sixers will return home to host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.

												The Rockets (10-3) knocked off the Mavericks (10-4) 95-92 Saturday night in Houston.Houston, which led by nine entering the fourth quarter, allowed Dallas to creep back into the game but was able to close it out in the final minute. Down two with just over 30 seconds to play, James Harden made a jumper, plus the foul, to put the Rockets up 93-92. Monta Ellis turned it over on the other end, and Trevor Ariza was subsequently fouled, converting both free throws to give Houston a three-point advantage. Dirk Nowitzki then missed a three-pointer, and Ellis was unable to hit on a desperation shot as time expired.Harden led the way for Houston, pouring in 32 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Patrick Beverley added 20 points, while Donatas Motiejunas had a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double. The Rockets were without Dwight Howard for the second straight game as he continues to nurse a strained right knee. In his absence, Houston was out-rebounded 50-4. The Rockets shot just 37 percent as a team, compared to Dallas’ 40 percent and also struggled with turnovers, committing 17, nine of which were credited to Motiejunas and Harden.Dallas had five players in double-figures, led by Ellis’ 17 points. Nowitzki added 11, and Chandler Parsons chipped in eight points and eight rebounds. Brandan Wright had a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double off the bench.Up next, the Mavs host the Pacers on Monday night. Houston plays host to the Knicks, also on Monday.

												The Sacramento Kings (8-5) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (3-9) 113-101 on Friday.Sacramento has won two straight games. They've had a terrific start to the season and haven't shown any signs of slowing down. While DeMarcus Cousins' line of 31 points and 18 rebounds is no great shock due to the frequency in which he put up such amazing lines, Ben McLemore's 22 points and nine rebounds gave McLemore the best game of his young career. Even retread Derrick Williams got in on the funk train Saturday against his former team. Williams put up 12 points and six rebounds in 30 minutes. The Kings continue their road trip against the Pelicans in New Orleans on Tuesday. Minnesota has lost two straight and seven of their last eight games. Injuries can be blamed for the depth of the Timberwolves' struggles this season, but they were never considered a team with much of a shot at a playoff spot in the stacked Western Conference. An argument could be made that the injuries the Timberwolves continue to suffer are a blessing in disguise considering that it's forcing the team to give their young talent run against top-flight teams. Andrew Wiggins scored a career-high 29 points in 41 minutes Saturday. Mo Williams helped Wiggins get those points. Williams finished with 11 points and 12 assists for his second double-double in the last three games. The Timberwolves have three days off before hosting the Milwuakee Bucks on Wednesday. By Wednesday's game, the Timberwolves expect to have Thaddeus Young (personal) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) back in the active lineup.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (7-5) defeated the Utah Jazz (5-9) 106-94 on Friday.New Orleans was coming off a 117-97 loss to the Denver Nuggets on Friday, but they finished their three-game road trip with a win to give them two of out three on the trip. Anthony Davis scored a career-high 43 points to pace the Pelicans. They'll return home to host the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.Utah has lost two straight, and while they have tons of talent on their roster, it looks like the Jazz will be focusing on development this season instead of fighting for a playoff spot. It's obvious watching the team that they are improving under coach Quin Snyder, so time and experience will be the test to see if the Jazz have the right guys to build a winning team around. Gordon Hayward paced the Jazz on Saturday, finishing with 31 points and eight rebounds in 39 minutes. Utah's next game is at home against the Chicago Bulls.

												The Orlando Magic (6-8) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (4-9) 105-100 on Friday.Orlando was down by 15 points heading into the fourth quarter but rallied to put up 41 points in the final quarter, out-scoring the Magic 41-21 in the final frame. Tobias Harris was the yoke for the Magic on Friday. He put up 17 points and 16 rebounds in 40 minutes. The Magic have won four of their last six games as their schedule has softened over the last two weeks. They'll host the Miami Heat on Saturday to complete their current back-to-back set.Charlotte has lost four straight games, and while their prospects this season look dire at the moment, the team has faced off against plenty of formidable teams in the early part of their schedule, leaving the door open to hope for more wins going forward. Just as a team like the Cleveland Cavaliers is sturggling to find consistency due to having so many new additions, the roster turnover for the Hornets can be pointed to as the source of their struggles thus far. Gary Neal (concussion) returned to action for the Hornets on Friday. He put up 17 points in 29 minutes off the bench. They'll go on the road Sunday to play the Heat in Miami.

												The Phoenix Suns (8-5) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-12) 122-96 on Friday.Phoenix is in the midst of a six-game road trip. After dropping the first game of the trip 120-107 to the Los Angeles Clippers, they've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never-weres of the Eastern Conference. Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday. He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench. They'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers.Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season. While that's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation, it's in no way a surprise that the Sixers haven't been able to pull off a win. Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday, an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season, and it's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick. K.J. McDaniels scored a career-high 17 points in 28 minutes, and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team didn't take much offense to his comments. The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks.

												The Atlanta Hawks (6-5) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3-10) 99-89 on Friday.Atlanta was coming off two straight losses but were able to beat the Pistons in relatively convincing fashion. Jeff Teague had his way in the paint and finished with 26 points and six assists in 33 minutes. DeMarre Carroll (groin) returned to action and was put right back into the starting lineup. He finished with nine points and five rebounds in 30 minutes. The Hawks have three days off before they go on the road to Washington to face the Wizards on Tuesday.Detroit continues to use their big lineup that features Josh Smith at small forward despite the fact that they've been unable to win games with it. The Pistons have lost four straight games. In Friday's loss, they shot 38 percent from the field and 19 percent from beyond the arc, two numbers that are hard to overcome and earn a win with. They have three days off before traveling to Milwaukee on Tuesday to face the Bucks.

												The Toronto Raptors (10-2) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (7-6) 124-83 on Friday.Toronto has won three straight games and are defining themselves as a contender to win the Eastern Conference this season. Kyle Lowry paced the Raptors on Friday. He put up 20 points and nine rebounds in 26 minutes. Toronto has had some gimmies in the early part of their schedule, but that won't be the case Saturday as they travel to Cleveland to take on LeBron James and the Cavaliers.Milwaukee has been one of the darlings of the NBA so far this season. They're playing better than any expert expected, and that's why Friday's drubbing at the hands of the Raptors was more of a surprise than it would have been in the past. Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle) was originally ruled out but was given the green light by coach Jason Kidd to come off the bench and play limited minutes. Milwaukee is on a back-to-back set. They'll host the Washington Wizards on Saturday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (11-2) defeated the Boston Celtics (4-7) 117-110 on Friday.Despite having several players playing through a stomach virus, the Grizzlies were able to claim their 11th win of the season. They shot 53 percent from the field and 50 percent from beyond the arc. Memphis also out-rebounded the Celtics 50-38. Tony Allen was the one notable player to sit out with the stomach virus that infected their locker room this week. The Grizzlies will stay at home to host the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday, a matchup that is always frought with enmity between Blake Griffin and Zach Randolph, making it a must-watch game.Boston's young roster didn't stand much of a chance against the gritty veterans of the Grizzlies. Kelly Olynyk was a bright spot Friday. He finished with 18 points and six rebounds in 27 minutes. The Celtics return home to host the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.

												The San Antonio Spurs (8-4) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (3-8) 121-92 on Friday.San Antonio has won three straight games. Their schedule was weighted with tough games to start the season, but as they've hit a lighter group of competition, the Spurs have excelled. Tony Parker tied his season-high of 28 points in 25 minutes. The Spurs return home to finish their back-to-back set Saturday as they host the Brooklyn Nets.Minnesota was missing four of their five starters, leaving only rookie Andrew Wiggins as their lone healthy starter to suit up for Friday's loss. Kevin Martin will be out indefinitely with a fracture in his wrist. Ricky Rubio (ankle), Thaddeus Young (personal) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) were also out. None of them will be available Saturday as the Timberwolves finish off their back-to-back set Saturday at home against the Sacramento Kings.

The Nets continue their three-game road trip in San Antonio on Saturday against the Spurs.Oklahoma City has lost five straight games. Andre Roberson moved back into the starting lineup at shooting guard, pushing Jeremy Lamb back to a bench role. Roberson put up four points in 22 minutes, but his production comes mostly on the defensive end. Lamb played just 17 minutes off the bench.

												The Washington Wizards (8-3) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (5-6) 91-78 on Friday.Washington knocked the Cavaliers under .500 at a part of the season where such a state seems improbable, regardless of how early in the season it is relative to the number of games everyone has left to play. LeBron James' teams may stumble from time to time, but they don't usually falter to the point the Cavs have thus far. The Wizards brought Bradley Beal off the bench for a second straight game as they work to get him up to speed. Beal put up 12 points in 32 minutes off the bench.Cleveland shot 36 percent from the field and coughed up 19 turnovers, two numbers that often come with a loss.

												The Denver Nuggets (5-7) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (6-5) 117-97 on Friday.Denver started off the season jittery as a June bug, losing six of their first seven games, but over their last five games, they've stolen four wins. It's hard to get a read on where the team is headed, but the narrative right now has at least a glimmer of hope for their prospects going forward. Kenneth Faried paced the Nuggets, finishing with 19 points and eight rebounds in 27 minutes. Denver will go on the road to face the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.New Orleans has had a tough schedule to start the season, so the fact they're still able to breathe above the .500 mark is impressive. They had six players finish in double-digits, but the team shot just 40 percent from the field, making it hard to secure the win. The Pelicans have one more game left on their current four-game road trip. They'll travel to Utah to take on the Jazz on Saturday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (7-4) defeated the Miami Heat (6-6) 110-93 on Thursday.Los Angeles was sputtering a little to start the season after coming in with high expectations in their second season under president and coach Doc Rivers, but they've won two games in a row to put them three games over .500, and though the Clippers have lost games to some of the Western Conference's other title contenders, they have gotten the job done against the bottom-feeder and mid-tier teams they should beat. Chris Paul led the way with a double-double of 26 points and 12 assists in 33 minutesm Thusday. The Clippers will play the Grizzlies in Memphis on Sunday for the third game of a seven-game road trip.Miami has dropped four of their last five games. Injuries can be blamed for most of their woes. Dwyane Wade missed four of those games with a hamstring issue, including being out Thursday. Josh McRoberts missed three games with a painful blister on his foot but returned Thursday.

												The Sacramento Kings (7-5) defeated the Chicago Bulls (8-4) 103-88 on Thursday.Sacramento had a four-game losing streak after their hot start, but they've won two of their last three games and have held their own against a murder's row of opponents lately. It's still relatively early in the season, but every time the Kings have stumbled, they've picked themselves up in the next game. DeMarcus Cousins (hip) and Rudy Gay (Achilles) played through their injuries Thursday. Cousins finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds in 34 minutes for a double-double. Gay put up 20 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes. The Kings will embark on a four-game road trip Saturday that begins in Minneapolis against the Timberwolves.Chicago is in the midst of a seven-game road trip. Pau Gasol sat out a second straight game with a calf injury. Derrick Rose missed a third straight game with a hamstring injury. Jimmy Butler continues to pace the Bulls this season. He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 37 minutes Thursday. The Bulls will finish off their back-to-back set in Portland on Friday against the Trail Blazers. Gasol and Rose remain questionable for the game.

												The San Antonio Spurs (7-4) knocked off the Cleveland Cavaliers (5-5) 92-90 on Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena.San Antonio has gotten off to a fairly slow start to the 2014 season, but all eyes were on them for this game against LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Spurs responded with an impressive road win, and the type of team effort that we're used to seeing from San Antonio. Tim Duncan led the way with 19 points (7-17 FG, 5-7 FT) and 10 rebounds, while also adding three assists, two steals and two blocks. Kawhi Leonard had an impressive night of his own, posting a double-double with 12 points (4-11 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT) and 10 rebounds. The biggest surprise for the Spurs on Wednesday had to be Boris Diaw, who played 39 minutes, while scoring 19 points (8-14 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), and contributing seven assists, six rebounds, three steals and one block. The Spurs will head to Minnesota to play the Timberwolves on Friday night.With the Spurs up by two in the final seconds, the ball was in James' hands, but he turned it over late, leaving the Cavaliers with another loss. James didn't have the type of night that we're used to seeing, as he scored just 15 points (6-17 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 1-1 FT). He also had nine assists, six rebounds, one steal and one block. Anderson Varejao was the one who led the charge for the Cavs on Wednesday, posting a double-double with 23 points (11-16 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-3 FT) and 11 rebounds. The Cavaliers now get a night off before facing a strong Washington Wizards team on the road on Friday night.

												The Indiana Pacers (5-7) knocked off the Charlotte Hornets (4-8) 88-86 at the buzzer on Wednesday night at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse.The Hornets saw injuries hit their lineup, as they were without both Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Gary Neal. Gerald Henderson got the start, but had a brutal night, going 0-6 from the field with zero points. The lone bright spots on Wednesday for the Hornets had to be Al Jefferson, who scored 28 points (12-22 FG, 4-4 FT), to go along with eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block, as well as Lance Stephenson, who scored 10 points (4-12 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT), but also grabbed eight rebounds and dished out seven assists. Charlotte heads home to take on the Orlando Magic on Friday night next.The Pacers got an impressive buzzer-beating reverse lay-up from Solomon Hill off of an air ball to grab this win on Wednesday. Hill managed just six total points (3-8 FG, 0-2 3Pt) and five rebounds, just a few nights after posting 21 points and 12 rebounds in a win over the Chicago Bulls. Roy Hibbert led the charge for the Pacers, scoring 18 points (7-14 FG, 4-6 FT), along with 11 rebounds, two assists and one block, while Donald Sloan posted a nice stat line that included 11 points (3-8 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 5-6 FT), nine rebounds, six assists and one steal.

												The Boston Celtics (4-6) went to Philadelphia and handed the 76ers (0-11) a 101-90 loss on Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.The Celtics have shown us moments of brilliance in the 2014 season, but they're simply looking to pick up some momentum at this point. This was a solid win, as six players scored at least nine points. Brandon Bass lead the way off the bench scoring 23 points (9-13 FG, 5-7 FT), to go along with six rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Jeff Green posted a double-double, with 11 points (5-13 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 1-1 FT) and 10 rebounds, while Rajon Rondo and Jared Sullinger both fell just short of double-doubles of their own. Sullinger had 22 points (10-15 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 1-3 FT) with nine rebounds, while Rajon Rondo had nine points (3-5 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and 13 assists. Boston heads to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Friday night next.The 76ers just can't get in the win column right now. They had five players score in double figures, but were led by Tony Wroten off the bench, who scored 21 points (7-19 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 6-9 FT), while contributing seven assists, three rebounds and one steal.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (7-5) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (4-7) 122-118 in a triple-overtime thriller in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center. For the Bucks, the young core of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker helped lead the team to victory. Jabari Parker had a career-high 23 points (8-13 FG, 7-10 FT) as he was able to consistently score against the aging Nets defense. Meanwhile, Antetokounmpo continues his solid play with 18 points (7-11 FG, 4-8 FT) and 12 rebounds. Off the bench, Ersan Ilyasova thrived against the Nets as he had a solid 14 point performance (7-12 FG). Despite the Nets hard-fought defeat, Brook Lopez was an absolute monster against the Bucks interior defense, as he had an efficient 26 point (11-19 FG, 4-4 FT) and seven rebound performance, that included some key offensive boards in the later stages of the game. The back-court duo of Deron Williams (7-14 FG, 3-7 3Pt) and Bojan Bogdanovic (7-16 FG, 4-11 3Pt) combined to score 37 points, as they helped keep the team close for the entire game. The Bucks continue their road swing by going to Toronto for a Friday night game, while Brooklyn will head to Oklahoma City to face the Thunder on Friday.  											",Brooklyn,Nets,Milwaukee,Bucks,Barclays Center,7,5,4,7,9.0,31.0,44.0,92.0,21.0,29.0,49.0,26.0,20.0,5.0,24.0,44.0,102.0,21.0,28.0,49.0,22.0,12.0,Joe Johnson,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,52,Giannis Antetokounmpo,12.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,47,Kevin Garnett,9.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Jabari Parker,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,41,Brook Lopez,7.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,26.0,11.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,43,Larry Sanders,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,14,Bojan Bogdanovic,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,16.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,46,Khris Middleton,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,28,Deron Williams,5.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,14.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,52,Brandon Knight,3.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,20.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,48,Mirza Teletovic,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,14.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,27,Zaza Pachulia,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Jarrett Jack,9.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,35,O.J.

												The Suns (7-5) sent the Pistons (3-9) to their third straight loss Wednesday night, hanging on for a 88-86 victory.Down eight with under two minutes to play, the Pistons got back-to-back threes from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Brandon Jennings to pull within two with 1:08 remaining. After an Alex Len turnover, Caldwell-Pope drilled another three, putting Detroit up one with 34 seconds to play. Eric Bledsoe responded on the other end with a lay-in, giving Phoenix an 87-86 advantage. With a chance to win the game, Detroit turned to Jennings, whose layup with five seconds remaining was blocked by Markieff Morris. The ball was kicked to Caldwell-Pope who misfired on a long three-pointer. Bledsoe corralled the rebound and was fouled with less than two seconds to play. He would make 1-of-2 at the line before a Jennings desperation heave at the buzzer fell short.Phoenix was led by Bledsoe’s 18 points to go with six rebounds and four assists. Goran Dragic added 12 points and four assists, and Morris chipped in 10 points. P.J. Tucker added 16 points of the bench. The Suns shot nearly 50 percent from the floor but got to the free throw line only 13 times.Jennings paced Detroit with 19 points (7-19 FG, 1-9 3Pt) and seven assists, and Greg Monroe contributed an 18-point, 12-rebound double-double. Caldwell-Pope had 15 points, while Josh Smith finished with only five points in 25 minutes.Up next, the Pistons head to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Friday. Phoenix travels to Philadelphia to take on the winless 76ers, also on Friday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves took it to the New York Knicks Wednesday at the Target Center, winning 115-99.Kevin Martin led the way for Minnesota with a prolific shooting performance, scoring 37 points (14-20 FG, 7-11 3Pt, 2-6 FT), a season-high. The only blemish on his night was at the free throw line, where he shot 33.3 percent. Normally, Martin is one of the more efficient free throw shooters in the league.The New York Knicks struggled defending the three-point line once again on Wednesday, allowing the Timberwolves to shoot 50 percent from three-point land (11-22 3Pt), a trend they would like to put an end to as the season progresses. Carmelo Anthony posted a nice line of 20 points (7-10 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), four rebounds, one assist, and one steal, while turning the ball over only once. The superstar played only 27 minutes and watched the game from the bench in the fourth quarter.Minnesota will look to build off this win as they take on the defending champion San Antonio Spurs on Friday. The Knicks match up against the lowly Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday, with hopes of turning their disappointing season around.

												The Denver Nuggets (4-7) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (3-10) 107-100 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.The Thunder were out-scored 34-25 by the Nuggets in the third quarter, putting them down 88-74 going into the fourth. To open the final quarter, the Thunder made a run as they were able to out-score the Nuggets 26-19, but came up just short in their comeback attempt and will take their tenth loss of the season, and third in as many games. The Nuggets were led by Wilson Chandler, who shot 8-for-15 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 21 points, while also grabbing nine rebounds. It was a season-high in points for Chandler, who hadn't reached the 20-point mark yet this season. Timofey Mozgov also had himself a game, as he contributed 17 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. Not necessarily known for his offensive game, Mozgov has now combined for 31 points in his last two outings. The other Denver player who really stood out was Ty Lawson. He recorded his second double-double in a row and third of the season, going off for 15 points and 15 assists. He's now averaging 16.9 points and 8.4 assists on the year. The Thunder on the other hand received most of their production from the trio of Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson and Sebastian Telfair. Telfair came off the bench for 29 minutes and went a perfect 7-for-7 from the field and 4-for-4 from the three-point line to score 18 points, as he arguably had his best game of the season. Ibaka recorded a 22-point, 13 rebound double-double, giving him his third on the year. He's now averaging 15.5 points and 7.8 rebounds on the season. Jackson came one assist shy of a double-double, as he posted 16 points (5-20 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and nine assists. It wasn't his most impressive shooting night, but he got it done from the free throw line. Anthony Morrow was the only other Thunder player to reach double figures, scoring 10 points in 28 minutes. The Nuggets' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday.  											",Denver,Nuggets,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Pepsi Center,3,10,4,7,10.0,29.0,40.0,82.0,17.0,22.0,42.0,25.0,8.0,10.0,23.0,36.0,79.0,18.0,25.0,39.0,21.0,10.0,Wilson Chandler,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,8.0,15.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,27,Lance Thomas,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Kenneth Faried,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Serge Ibaka,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,15.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,36,Timofey Mozgov,7.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,17.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,35,Steven Adams,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Arron Afflalo,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,33,Jeremy Lamb,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,20,Ty Lawson,1.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,35,Reggie Jackson,7.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,20.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,37,Danilo Gallinari,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,20,Andre Roberson,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,6,Darrell Arthur,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Kendrick Perkins,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,24,Randy Foye,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,14,Anthony Morrow,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,28,JaVale McGee,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Sebastian Telfair,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,29,Nate Robinson,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,12,Nick Collison,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,19

												The Los Angeles Lakers (3-9) defeated the Houston Rockets (9-3) 98-92 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston.The Lakers have now won two games in a row, stealing a surprising four-point victory on the road in Houston. Without Dwight Howard, who sat out with a knee injury, the Rockets didn't have their usual presence inside the lane, and were out-rebounded 47-38. They also were out-scored 28-17 in the fourth quarter, as the Lakers closed out strong and sealed the victory.As always, the Lakers were led by their superstar Kobe Bryant. Bryant shot 10-for-28 from the field and a dismal 1-for-7 from the three-point line, but still scored 29 points, while adding seven assists. He got a boost in scoring from the free-throw line though, as he converted on 8-of-10. In his second game back from a thumb injury, Nick Young was able to put up solid numbers again. He scored 16 points off the bench, as he shot 6-for-15 from the field and 2-for-8 from beyond the arc. The Lakers frontcourt of Jordan Hill and Carlos Boozer were both big in the victory, with each posting a double-double of their own. Hill had 16 points and 10 rebounds, marking his fourth double-double in as many games. Boozer finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds, as he posted his second double-double in a row.For the Rockets, James Harden posted a very efficient 24 points (7-11 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 8-10 FT), while also handing out seven assists. He's now averaging 23.7 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.9 assists on the year. Starting at point guard, Patrick Beverley was able to score 15 points, equaling a season-high for him. The Rockets received a big boost off the bench from Kostas Papanikolaou as well. He went 6-for-10 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line to score 19 points, while also grabbing six rebounds. He's only reached double figures in scoring twice this year, so it was a nice surprise for the Rockets. Trevor Ariza was the only other player in double-digits, as he had 13 points and seven rebounds. The Lakers' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, while the Rockets will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday.   											",Houston,Rockets,Los Angeles,Lakers,Toyota Center,3,9,9,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Trevor Ariza,7.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,13.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,40,Wesley Johnson,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,36,Donatas Motiejunas,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,18,Carlos Boozer,13.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Tarik Black,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Jordan Hill,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,James Harden,4.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,37,Kobe Bryant,5.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,29.0,10.0,28.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,39,Patrick Beverley,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,34,Jeremy Lin,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,30,Kostas Papanikolaou,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,33,Ed Davis,11.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Joey Dorsey,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,Nick Young,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,15.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,28,Francisco Garcia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,11,Ronnie Price,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,15,Jason Terry,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,20,Robert Sacre,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Isaiah Canaan,,,,,,,,,,,,Jordan Clarkson,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Los Angeles Lakers (2-9) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (5-5) 114-109 on Tuesday at Philips Arena in Atlanta.The Lakers were able to use a strong first half to allow for the victory Tuesday, out-scoring the Hawks 67-52. Despite being down 15 points coming into the third quarter, the Hawks went on a 13-0 run to get right back into the game, but unlike how the majority of the season has gone so far for the Lakers, they were able to hold off the comeback and secure the win.The Lakers shot 54 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three-point line in the win, while also receiving contributions up and down the roster. Kobe Bryant lead the way, scoring 28 points (10-18 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT), while handing out three assists. Bouncing back from a six-point game Sunday, Carlos Boozer was able to notch his first double-double of the season, as he finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Nick Young also made his much-anticipated season debut and didn't dissapoint, as he shot 6-for-10 from the field and 2-for-4 from beyond the arc to score 17 points in 28 minutes off the bench. Both Jordan Hill and Jeremy Lin contributed double-doubles of their own, with Hill scoring 18 points along with 10 rebounds, and Lin scoring 15 points and handing out 10 assists.The Hawks' second half comeback was lead by Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap. Millsap shot 11-for-16 from the field to score 29 points, while also grabbing four rebounds. He's now averaging 16.8 points and 8.4 rebounds on the year. Teague finished with 23 points and three assists, as he shot 8-for-14 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line. Thabo Sefolosha got the start at small forward in this one, with both DeMarre Carroll (groin) and Mike Scott (back) sitting out. He came one rebound shy of a double-double as he contributed 10 points and nine rebounds in the loss. The Lakers' next game will be on the road Wednesday against the Houston Rockets, while the Hawks will be at hom to play the Detroit Pistons on Friday. 											",Atlanta,Hawks,Los Angeles,Lakers,State Farm Arena,2,9,5,5,9.0,27.0,41.0,85.0,18.0,23.0,38.0,22.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,Thabo Sefolosha,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,31,Wesley Johnson,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,31,Paul Millsap,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,29.0,11.0,16.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,32,Carlos Boozer,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,10.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29,Al Horford,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,30,Jordan Hill,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Kyle Korver,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,39,Kobe Bryant,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,18.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,36,Jeff Teague,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,30,Jeremy Lin,3.0,10.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,30,Pero Antic,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,17,Ed Davis,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Kent Bazemore,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5,Nick Young,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,27,Mike Scott,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,15,Ronnie Price,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,17,Dennis Schroder,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Robert Sacre,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Shelvin Mack,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,20,Jordan Clarkson,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Bucks (6-5) held off the Knicks (3-9) 117-113 in Milwaukee on Tuesday.Milwaukee, which led by 17 at halftime, extended the lead to as much as 26 points in the third quarter, but the Knicks came storming back to close the gap late in the fourth quarter. Down 15 to begin the final period, the Knicks slowly chipped away at the lead, whittling it down to single digits with under three minutes to play. A Tim Hardaway, Jr. layup followed by a thunderous Iman Shumpert baseline slam cut the lead to just four with 1:51 remaining, but Khris Middleton responded with a pair of free throws on the other end to extend it back to six. After two J.R. Smith free throws, Milwaukee ran the shot clock down on its ensuing possession, ending in an Ersan Ilyasova step-back jumper from the left corner. Ilyasova knocked it down, returning the lead to six points. While the Bucks allowed New York to score three baskets in the final 30 seconds, Jerryd Bayless was able to ice the game at the line, going 5-of-6 in the final 26 seconds.The Bucks, who won their fourth game in five tries, placed seven players in double-figures, led by 20 points from Ilyasova off the bench. Brandon Knight added 14 points and nine assists, while Zaza Pachulia, starting in place of the injured Larry Sanders, added 14 points and 13 rebounds. Jabari Parker chipped in 12 points, and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 13 points and six rebounds in 18 minutes. Milwaukee out-rebounded New York 44-28 and scored 14 more points in the paint.The Knicks lost for the eighth time in their last nine games despite shooting 55 percent from the field. Carmelo Anthony led the way with 26 points, six rebounds and five assists, and Hardaway added 24 points off the bench. Shumpert finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in 36 minutes, easily his best performance of the season.Milwaukee heads east to take on the Nets in Brooklyn on Wednesday, while New York moves on to face the Timberwolves in Minnesota, also on Wednesday.

												The Phoenix Suns (6-5) defeated the Boston Celtics (3-6) 118-114 on Monday at TD Garden Arena in Boston. Despite only shooting a total of 16 free throws compared to the 31 that the Celtics shot, the Suns were still able to hold off the second-half charge by the Celtics to secure the win after dropping their last two. The Celtics are now riding a three-game losing streak, after losing by less than five points in their previous two games. Markieff Morris went off Monday, shooting 14-for-21 from the field and 1-for-3 from the three-point line to score 30 points, while also grabbing seven rebounds. This was a season-high for Morris, who scored only five points in their previous game against the Clippers. Goran Dragic also had a productive night offensively. He scored 22 points (9-15 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-1 FT), while adding seven assists and six rebounds. Like Morris, this was a season-high for Dragic, who's now combined for 41 points in his last two games. For the second game in a row, Alex Len performed well of the bench, as he scored 19 points (8-10 FG, 3-3 FT), and added seven rebounds. After reaching double figures only once in the first nine games of the season, Len has now scored 17 and 19 points in consecutive games. Marcus Morris shot a solid 5-for-8 from the field and 3-for-5 from beyond the arc for 13 points and seven assists.The Celtics were led by Jeff Green, who shot 59 percent from the field to score 28 points (10-17 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 8-9 FT), while also recording two steals. He's now averaging 18.9 points and five rebounds on the season. Rajon Rondo came one assist shy of his second triple-double, as he finished with 14 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. He's nearly averaging a triple-double, as he boasts season averages of 10.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 12.0 assists per game. Coming off the bench, Tyler Zeller had a season-high 19 points, and pulled down seven rebounds. It was only the second game this season where he's scored in double figures. Jared Sullinger also came up two rebounds shy of a double-double, as he posted 18 points and eight rebounds.  The Suns' next game will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, while the Celtics will travel to Philadelphia to play the Sixers on Wednesday.

												The Miami Heat (6-5) got an impressive road victory over the Brooklyn Nets (4-6) 95-83 at the Barclays Center on Monday night.The Heat were impressive for a few reasons in this win over the Nets, but what made it even more impressive was the fact that they got it done without All-Star shooting guard Dwyane Wade. Wade was out with a hamstring injury, but the team rallied and put up a strong all-around performance to get the win. They were led by Mario Chalmers, who scored 22 points (5-12 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 11-13 FT) to go with five assists, three rebounds and two steals in 34 minutes. Chris Bosh was just short of a double-double with 15 points (5-11 FG, 1-2 3 Pt, 4-4 FT), nine rebounds, one assist and one steal in 29 minutes. The Heat saw 10 players score on Monday night, and their bench production was big, putting up a total of 37 points. Miami now heads home to take on the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night.The Nets on the other hand are in the midst of a tough four-game losing streak, and while they got a solid 22 points (8-11 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT) from Bojan Bogdanovic, the rest of the starters struggled to do much. One of the lone bright spots was backup point guard Jarrett Jack, who put up 15 points (5-9 FG, 1-1 3 Pt, 4-4 FT), four assists and one steal off of the bench. Brooklyn is struggling to find answers right now, but they'll get a night off before taking on the Milwaukee Bucks at home on Wednesday night.

												The Orlando Magic (5-7) took down the Detroit Pistons (3-8) 107-93 on the road at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday night.The Magic may finally have found their groove. Winners of three of their last four games, Orlando is looking like a team that you don't want to play right now. On Monday night, the team was led by an impressive all-around performance from their starting lineup. Each of the five starters managed to put up double-digit points, with Nikola Vucevic posting an impressive double-double that included 25 points (10-18 FG, 5-5 FT), with 14 rebounds and three assists. Tobias Harris also had another strong night, scoring 24 points (10-17 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-2 FT), and contributing five rebounds, five steals, four assists and one block. Orlando heads back home next, and will be tested against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night.The Pistons on the other hand have lost two straight, and five of their last six games. This team can't get the ball rolling in the right direction currently, regardless of who steps up. On Monday, it was Caron Butler who stepped up off the bench for Detroit, scoring 20 points (5-11 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 7-7 FT), with six rebounds and one assist. The Pistons also got a double-double from big man Andre Drummond, who scored 12 points (5-12 FG, 2-4 FT), to go along with 10 rebounds and three blocks. Detroit will remain at home as they take on the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (10-1) flexed their muscles, knocking off the Houston Rockets (9-2) 119-93 at the FedExForum in Memphis on Monday night.The Grizzlies have officially shown us that they are the real deal, if any doubters were left out there. The talented Houston Rockets came to town on Monday, but the Grizzlies were ready to defend their home court. Memphis not only won the game, but dominated in impressive fashion. Memphis won with production from across the board, as eight players scored nine or more points. Mike Conley led the way by scoring 19 points (6-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and dishing out six assists. Beno Udrih led the bench in a big way, scoring 13 points (5-8 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 3-3 FT), to go along with six assists and one rebound. Memphis looks like a force to be reckoned with currently, and next they'll head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Wednesday night.For the Rockets, it's safe to say that the sky didn't come falling down with this loss, but it was definitely a game they wanted to make a statement with. Houston was just out-played in this game, and while Trevor Ariza and Dwight Howard had solid games, James Harden was surprisingly quiet, and struggled from the field. Ariza scored 16 points (4-13 FG, 1-7 3Pt, 7-7 FT), with four assists, three rebounds and one steal, while Howard had 15 points (6-11 FG, 3-4 FT), along with nine rebounds and two assists. Harden on the other hand, struggled with just six points (1-8 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 4-5 FT), but added five rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block. Houston now heads back home to take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs (6-4) kept the Philadelphia 76ers (0-10) winless to start the 2014-15 season, as they recorded the 100-75 victory on Monday night at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.It started out rough for the 76ers, as they were down 30-13 at the end of the first quarter, and just couldn't get back into it from there. For Philadelphia, they are still searching for answers, as only two players managed to score in double digits on Monday night. The two players who led the way in scoring included power forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who had 13 points (4-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT), with four rebounds and two blocks, and Michael Carter-Williams, who posted a line of 16 points (7-14 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 1-3 FT), five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Philadelphia will try to get their first win of 2014 on Wednesday at home against the Boston Celtics.For the Spurs, it was just another day at the office. San Antonio had seven players score eight or more points, and five score in double digits. Matt Bonner was the surprising one who led the way on Monday night though, as he scored 18 points (7-10 FG, 4-6 3Pt), to go along with three assists and one rebound. Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard all played 20 minutes or less in this game, meaning that the reserves got plenty of time on the court. In total, 11 players were on the floor for at least 16 minutes. San Antonio will get a night off before a huge game against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road Wednesday night.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (8-3) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (5-4) 102-93 on Monday at the Moda Center in Portland.With their fifth straight victory, Portland widens their Northwest Division lead, as they're currently four games ahead of the second-place Utah Jazz. Throughout the majority of the game, New Orleans had a significant advantage over the Trail Blazers. Through the first three quarters, the Pelicans out-scored Portland 80-68, as they were able to shoot 55 percent from the field. In the beginning of the fourth quarter, that fate quickly changed, as Portland was able to hold New Orleans to an abysmal 16 percent, which ultimately lead to their victory. Despite the defeat, Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis had a fantastic 31 point (14-20 FG), 11 rebound, three steal and three block performance. In his last three games, Davis has averaged 26 points per game, while shooting 71 percent from the field. Tyreke Evans scored an inefficient 13 points (5-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-5 FT), but was able to dish a game-high eight assists. Ryan Anderson was the team's lone off-the-bench bright spot, as he added 12 points. The Trail Blazers were lead by the deadly LaMarcus Aldridge, who scored 22 points (9-18 FG, 4-4 FT), while also grabbing nine rebounds. 10 of Aldridge's points came during the game-clinching fourth quarter, as New Orleans couldn't figure out a way to stop him. Damian Lillard added 24 points (7-18 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 8-8 FT), while also dishing off seven assists. Chris Kaman was Portland's lone bench performer, as he had a 15 point (7-10 FG), 10 rebound double-double performance. Portland will stay at home during their next game as they'll square off against the Chicago Bulls on Friday, while New Orleans will travel to Sacramento to face the Kings on Tuesday.  											",Portland,Trail Blazers,New Orleans,Pelicans,Moda Center,5,4,8,3,7.0,19.0,38.0,76.0,19.0,23.0,43.0,20.0,18.0,5.0,19.0,38.0,85.0,12.0,19.0,41.0,16.0,11.0,Allen Crabbe,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,20,Anthony Davis,11.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,31.0,14.0,20.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,37,LaMarcus Aldridge,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,36,Tyreke Evans,5.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,18.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,38,Robin Lopez,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Alexis Ajinca,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,15,Wesley Matthews,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,35,Eric Gordon,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,34,Damian Lillard,4.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,18.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,35,Jrue Holiday,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,19.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,39,Chris Kaman,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,20,Luke Babbitt,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,Steve Blake,2.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,29,Ryan Anderson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,35,Joel Freeland,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Austin Rivers,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,16,CJ McCollum,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,17,Jeff Withey,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Will Barton,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Darius Miller,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4

												The Chicago Bulls (8-3) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (5-4) 105-89 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.With their victory over Los Angeles, Chicago moves within a half game of the Eastern Conference leading Toronto Raptors. Meanwhile, Los Angeles is now tied with New Orleans for the eigth seed in the Western Conference. Despite the double-digit victory, Chicago trailed Los Angeles 50-48 going into halftime. As the game transitioned to the second half, Chicago's offense heated up as they shot an outstanding 59 percent until the end of the game, while Los Angeles only shot 44 percent. The Chicago Bulls had all five starters score in double-digits, with Jimmy Butler leading the way scoring 22 points (6-17 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 9-10 FT), while also contributing six rebounds and a game-high eight assists. While he only had 11 points (5-8 FG), Joakim Noah was able to make a tremendous impact as he had a season-high 16 rebounds and six assists. Coming off the bench, rookie forward Nikola Mirotic had an extremely solid performance, as he had 11 points (5-10 FG, 1-4 3Pt), while also grabbing seven rebounds. The Los Angeles Clippers were lead by potential MVP candidate Blake Griffin, who had a 19 point (7-15 FG, 5-10 FT), 10 rebound double-double performance. While Griffin was the better all-around player, Clippers sixth man Jamal Crawford lead the entire team with 24 points (10-17 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-5 FT), while also dishing out five assists. The NBA's leading rebounder, DeAndre Jordan, continued to clean up the glass, as he collected 17 rebounds, while also adding 10 points (5-6 FG). The Bulls' will stay on the road as their next game will be in Sacramento on Thursday, while Los Angeles will travel to Orlando to face the Magic on Wednesday.  											",Los Angeles,Clippers,Chicago,Bulls,Staples Center,8,3,5,4,7.0,23.0,36.0,81.0,10.0,22.0,40.0,20.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,Matt Barnes,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,28,Mike Dunleavy,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,35,Blake Griffin,10.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,36,Taj Gibson,5.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,20.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,41,DeAndre Jordan,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,36,Joakim Noah,16.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,36,JJ Redick,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,23,Jimmy Butler,6.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,17.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,45,Chris Paul,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,37,Kirk Hinrich,2.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,33,Jamal Crawford,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,10.0,17.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,27,Nikola Mirotic,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,18,Spencer Hawes,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,17,Aaron Brooks,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,19,Reggie Bullock,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,12,E'Twaun Moore,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Jordan Farmar,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13,Doug McDermott,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10,Glen Davis,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Cameron Bairstow,,,,,,,,,,,

												The New York Knicks (3-8) defeated the Denver Nuggets (2-7) 109-93 on Sunday.New York was coming off a depressing buzzer-beating loss to the Utah Jazz on Friday in which Trey Burke sank a long two-point field goal as time expired. The Knicks' win Sunday marks the end of their seven-game losing streak. Carmelo Anthony has been told by coach Derek Fisher to play his game and not overthink everything trying to perfectly execute the Triangle offense. In his last two games, Anthony has averaged 37 points, indicating that he's possibly starting to find his way within the new system. The Knicks go on the road to Milwaukee on Tuesday to face the Bucks.Denver has been the enigma of the NBA this season. They have a lot of talent, but they can't seem to figure out how they want to use it from game to game. As a team, they shot 39 percent from the field and coughed up 17 turnovers to the Knicks on Sunday. The Nuggets suffered through a six-game losing streak already this season, and Sunday's loss may be the start of another losing streak with the team finishing their current three-game roadtrip in Cleveland on Monday against the Cavaliers. 											",New York,Knicks,Denver,Nuggets,Madison Square Garden,2,7,3,8,6.0,14.0,41.0,76.0,21.0,27.0,43.0,16.0,15.0,13.0,34.0,32.0,80.0,15.0,24.0,33.0,19.0,17.0,Quincy Acy,8.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Wilson Chandler,5.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,14.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,31,Carmelo Anthony,9.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,10.0,14.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,38,Kenneth Faried,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,32,Samuel Dalembert,8.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Timofey Mozgov,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Shane Larkin,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,26,Arron Afflalo,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,31,JR Smith,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,28.0,10.0,16.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,36,Ty Lawson,2.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,6.0,18.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,39,Jason Smith,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Darrell Arthur,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,21,Amar'e Stoudemire,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Danilo Gallinari,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,13,Pablo Prigioni,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,23,JaVale McGee,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Travis Wear,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,Gary Harris,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,Tim Hardaway Jr.,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,Nate Robinson,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,10

												The Milwaukee Bucks (5-5) beat the Miami Heat (5-5) 91-84 on Sunday at American Airlines Arena in Miami.Miami went into halftime with an eight point lead, but the Bucks came out of the half on fire and quickly turned the deficit around, out-scoring the Heat 26 to 13 in the third quarter. They also played some solid defense and held the Heat to shoot only 41 percent from the field.The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight, who finished with 20 points (7-for-13 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and four assists. He hit a few clutch three pointers down the stretch to keep the Bucks out front and secure the victory. The two youngsters, Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo also held their own in the victory. Antetokounmpo contributed 11 points and seven rebounds, as he moved into the starting lineup and pushed Ersan Ilyasova to the bench. Parker produced 13 points of his own and grabbed 13 rebounds, as he was pushed to power forward with the addition of Antetokounmpo in the starting lineup as the small forward. Kris Middleton was dealing with a knee injury coming into this game, but finished with 10 points off the bench in 20 minutes.The Heat had all five starters reach double-digit scoring, but it wasn't enough to take the victory. Mario Chalmers went 7-for-13 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line to score 18 points, while also handing out five assists. He got the start at shooting guard, with Dwyane Wade sitting out. Chris Bosh came into the game averaging 21.6 points and 9.1 rebounds, but struggled offensively as he shot only 2-for-17 from the field and 1-for-6 from beyond the arc to finish with 10 points. Coming off the bench, rookie Shabazz Napier had one of his better games of the year. He had a career-high 10 points (4-for-5 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and also pulled down a career-high five rebounds in 26 minutes. He seemed to get a slight increase in playing time with Wade out. Shawne Williams also posted a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, marking his first of the year.The Bucks' next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Tuesday, while the Heat will go on the road to Brooklyn to take on the Nets on Monday.

												The Houston Rockets (9-1) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (3-8) 69-65 on Sunday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.This was an all-around ugly game for both teams, marked by a few scuffles and technicals along the way. Both teams shot very poorly, as Houston shot 29 percent from the field and 20 percent from the three-point line, while Oklahoma City shot 29 percent from the field and 16 percent from beyond the arc. The Rockets did take a 54-45 rebounding advantage by the end of the game, which may have allowed them the ugly victory.For the Rockets, James Harden had a game-high 19 points, while also adding nine rebounds and five assists. He struggled with his three-point shot though, as he only went 2-for-9 from behind the three-point line. Dwight Howard came one rebound shy of his eigth double-double of the season, as he finished with 12 points and nine rebounds. He struggled offensively and couldn't reach his season average of 19.2 points per game. Trevor Ariza chipped in 11 points, but also shot pretty poorly, as he went 4-for-11 from the field and 1-for-4 from the three-point line. The Rockets bench had a meager eight total points, with Francisco Garcia scoring six of those eight, so they didn't offer much help to the starters. Patrick Beverley (hamstring) returned to action for the Rockets after missing four game. He played 29 minutes as the starting point guard.The Thunder were led by Lance Thomas and Reggie Jackson, who scored 15 points a piece. Jackson had a surprising season-high 11 rebounds, but shot only 3-for-11 from the field. Most of his points came from the free-throw line as he converted on a perfect nine for nine. The 15 points for Thomas were also a season-high for him, although like Jackson, he got most of his production from the free-throw line, where he made 7-of-8.The only other Thunder player to reach double figures was Serge Ibaka, as he contributed 10 points and six rebounds. Continuing to come off the bench since returning from MCL surgery, Anthony Morrow struggled mightily as well, shooting only 1-for-9 from the field and 0-for-2 from beyond the arc for four points. Normally, scoring only 65 points would mean a blowout, but surprisingly, it kept the Thunder very much alive in this one.  The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzles on Monday, while the Thunder will also go on the road to Utah to play the Jazz on Tuesday. 											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Houston,Rockets,Chesapeake Energy Arena,9,1,3,8,3.0,19.0,20.0,68.0,22.0,28.0,45.0,14.0,15.0,7.0,35.0,23.0,80.0,16.0,30.0,54.0,11.0,14.0,Lance Thomas,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26,Trevor Ariza,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,37,Serge Ibaka,6.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,34,Donatas Motiejunas,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,32,Steven Adams,6.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Dwight Howard,9.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,39,Jeremy Lamb,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,25,James Harden,9.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,5.0,17.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,37,Reggie Jackson,11.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,36,Patrick Beverley,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,28,Anthony Morrow,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,28,Jason Terry,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,19,Kendrick Perkins,6.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Tarik Black,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,13,Nick Collison,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,15,Kostas Papanikolaou,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,15,Sebastian Telfair,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,21,Francisco Garcia,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,12,Ish Smith,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Troy Daniels,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4

												The Golden State Warriors (8-2) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (1-9) 136-115 on Sunday.Golden State is on a three-game win streak. They remain without David Lee (hamstring), but Draymond Green has been more than a capable fill-in. Everyone on their roster that was on the team last season is experiencing a new level of success under new coach Steve Kerr and his offensive system that stresses ball movement. Both Stephen Curry and Andrew Bogut finished with double-doubles Sunday. The Warriors get four days off before hosting the Utah Jazz on Friday.Kobe Bryant scored 44 points in 31 minutes. He shot 15-of-34 from the field and 11-of-16 from the free-throw line. Los Angeles shot 39 percent from the field as a team, while Warriors shot 54 percent. The Lakers have lost four straight games, and they start a three-game roadtrip Tuesday in Atlanta against the Hawks. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Golden State,Warriors,Staples Center,8,2,1,9,3.0,16.0,38.0,98.0,28.0,35.0,46.0,15.0,6.0,13.0,26.0,43.0,78.0,29.0,32.0,46.0,32.0,9.0,Wesley Johnson,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,31,Harrison Barnes,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,24,Carlos Boozer,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Draymond Green,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,24,Jordan Hill,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Andrew Bogut,10.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Kobe Bryant,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,44.0,15.0,34.0,3.0,12.0,2.0,31,Klay Thompson,3.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,18.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,29,Jeremy Lin,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Stephen Curry,4.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,30.0,10.0,19.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,29,Ed Davis,6.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Andre Iguodala,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,20,Ronnie Price,6.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,30,Leandro Barbosa,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Ryan Kelly,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,Marreese Speights,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20,Jordan Clarkson,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Shaun Livingston,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Robert Sacre,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Brandon Rush,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,5

												The Washington Wizards (7-2) defeated the Orlando Magic (4-7) 98-93 on Saturday.Washington is on a three-game win streak, which included wins against the Indiana Pacers, Detroit Pistons, and Orlando. While their 7-2 record is impressive, and everyone expects the Wizards to be a force to be reckoned with in the playoffs next summer, they have had an easy schedule to start the season. In fact, their two losses came against the only two teams they've played this season who are considered locks to make the playoffs (Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors). Bradley Beal has been out since the preseason with a broken wrist, but he is expected to make his debut next Friday. The Wizards have three days off before they'll host the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday.Orlando welcomed Victor Oladipo back to their active roster in the team's 101-85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday, but they brought him off the bench. Saturday, they gave him back his starting job at point guard and sent rookie Elfrid Payton to the bench to serve in a backup role. All five starters finished with double-digit scoring Saturday, but it wasn't enough to secure the win. The Magic will finish their current two-game roadtrip against the Detroit Pistons on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (5-3) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (5-4) 127-94 on Saturday.Cleveland has won four straight games, and in their last three games, they've scored at least 118 points. Their offense is firing on all cylinders, and coach David Blatt is using unconventional lineups to get the work done. He's regularly used LeBron James as the point guard. While James has always facilitated the offense, he hasn't spent a lot of time at point guard, and using a 6-8 forward there is creating devastating matchup problems for the Cavaliers' opponents. James scored 32 points Saturday and has averaged 35 points over the last three games. Cleveland will host the Denver Nuggets on Monday. They've already played once this season. The Cavs defeated the Nuggets 110-101 in their first matchup.Atlanta was on a four-game win streak before they ran into the monolithic Cavaliers. The Hawks gave up 33 points on 19 turnovers, all but handing over the game to the Cavaliers. Cleveland was up 71-43 at halftime, and the Hawks were resigned to their fate. John Jenkins started the second half at shooting guard in place of Kyle Korver, who the Hawks decided to rest due to the game being a route. Atlanta's next game is Tuesday. They'll host the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Indiana Pacers (4-7) defeated the Chicago Bulls (7-3) 99-90 on Saturday.Indiana is 3-1 over their last four games. Though they dropped their last game to the lowly Denver Nuggets on Friday, the Pacers' wins over the Bulls and Miami Heat in their last three games should be encouraging considering the fact that they remain without David West (ankle), George Hill (knee), C.J. Watson (foot), C.J. Miles (calf), Rodney Stuckey (foot), and Paul George (leg). The Pacers return home to host the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday.Chicago was without Derrick Rose (hamstring), and the Pacers were able to take advantage. Surprisingly, the Pacers out-rebounded the Bulls 46-34. Jimmy Butler continues to show off his offensive game this season. He scored a career-high 32 points, earning 11 of those points at the line on 14 attempts. Rose's status will likely be questionable for the Bulls' next game. They begin a seven-game roadtrip Monday in Los Angeles against the Clippers. 											",Chicago,Bulls,Indiana,Pacers,United Center,4,7,7,3,4.0,17.0,35.0,83.0,16.0,23.0,34.0,18.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,Mike Dunleavy,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,27,Chris Copeland,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,38,Pau Gasol,6.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,4.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33,Luis Scola,11.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,21.0,10.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Joakim Noah,4.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,31,Roy Hibbert,7.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,35,Jimmy Butler,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,32.0,10.0,17.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,40,Solomon Hill,12.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,6.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,33,Kirk Hinrich,2.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,7.0,17.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,31,Donald Sloan,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,24,Aaron Brooks,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,17,Damjan Rudez,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,23,Taj Gibson,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,24,Ian Mahinmi,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Doug McDermott,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,13,AJ Price,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,23,Nikola Mirotic,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,5,Lavoy Allen,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Tony Snell,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,12,CJ Miles,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Memphis Grizzlies improved their record to an NBA-best 9-1 with a 95-88 victory over the Detroit Pistons (3-7) Saturday at FedExForum.Detroit was out-scored 25-16 in the opening quarter, but rallied behind a Kyle Singler three-point barrage to cut the deficit to one at halftime and take a brief lead during the third quarter before the Grizzlies ultimately pulled away. Singler finished with a season-high 21 points on 5-of-7 shooting from downtown. The 21-point effort was Singler's first double-digit scoring game of the season. Greg Monroe added a 16-point, 11-rebound double double for Detroit.The Grizzlies were led by the front court duo of Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph, who combined for 40 points and 30 rebounds. Randolph's 22 boards were a season-high, and Gasol's 23 points gave the Memphis center his fifth game this season of 20 or more points. Memphis shot just 37 percent from the field, but controlled the glass and made a living at the free-throw line to take the victory. The Grizzlies out-rebounded Detroit 53-43, and shot 27-33 from the charity stripe.The Pistons were unable to get efficient production out of their back court against the tough Memphis defense that allows the fewest points per game in the NBA. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope shot 1-for-11 while Brandon Jennings and D.J. Augustin each shot below 40 percent.

												The Dallas Mavericks (7-3) took down the Minnesota Timberwolves (2-7) in impressive fashion 131-117 on Saturday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.The Mavericks are simply on a roll right now, and seem to be hitting their stride early on in this 2014 season. On Saturday, they got the definition of a ""team win"", with eight players scoring in double figures, and Monta Ellis leading the charge with 30 points (11-21 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT). While Ellis played 35 minutes, he was the only starter to see more than 29 minutes, as Dirk Nowitzki played just 23 and Tyson Chandler played only 24. Dallas was up by 19 at halftime, so they were able to rest some key players and get the reserves some additional playing time. Al-Farouq Aminu had an impressive night off the bench with 10 points (5-7 FG, 0-2 3Pt), six rebounds, three steals, two blocks and one assist in 23 minutes. The Mavericks will now head to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Monday night.For the Timberwolves, we saw them drop their fifth straight on Saturday, and each loss has been by at least nine points. They haven't been the same team without Ricky Rubio (ankle), and the minutes were spread out in a big way on Saturday night. A total of 11 players played, and everyone was out there for at least 12 minutes. Interestingly, Nikola Pekovic was the one who played just 12 minutes, scoring only two points (0-2 FG, 2-2 FT) to go with five rebounds and one assist. One of the few bright spots for Minnesota was Kevin Martin, who scored 34 points (12-17 FG, 4-6 3Pt, 6-6 FT) to go with three rebounds and one assist. Another name that fans had to be happy to hear was Shabazz Muhammad, who put up 18 points (6-7 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 5-5 FT) to go with four rebounds and two assists in only 14 minutes. Minnesota gets three days to recover before taking on the New York Knicks at home on Wednesday night.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (6-3) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (4-4) 97-87 on Saturday.Portland has won four straight games, and they earned their latest win with LaMarcus Aldridge (illness) and Nicolas Batum (knee) out of the lineup. Allen Crabbe has been filling in as the starting small forward while Batum has been out the last three games, and coach Terry Stotts threw a minor curve ball Saturday by inserting Meyers Leonard into the starting lineup in place of Aldridge. Leonard pulled down 12 rebounds and showed off his new three-point shot, converting 1-of-3 attempts. The Trail Blazers have two more games on their homestand, with the next coming against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday.Brooklyn dropped all three games on their short Western Conference roadtrip, and they'll head home to host the Miami Heat on Monday. Portland's three-point shooting was too much for Brooklyn on Saturday, and the Nets struggled on offense, shooting just 39 percent from the field and five percent from beyond the arc. Kevin Garnett recorded a double-double of 12 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes. 											",Portland,Trail Blazers,Brooklyn,Nets,Moda Center,4,5,7,3,11.0,26.0,33.0,78.0,20.0,27.0,47.0,26.0,14.0,1.0,19.0,35.0,89.0,14.0,15.0,40.0,14.0,9.0,Allen Crabbe,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,31,Joe Johnson,6.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,18.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,36,Meyers Leonard,12.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,29,Kevin Garnett,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,27,Robin Lopez,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,29,Brook Lopez,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21.0,10.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,29,Wesley Matthews,5.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,3.0,13.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,32,Bojan Bogdanovic,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,28,Damian Lillard,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,28.0,8.0,14.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,37,Deron Williams,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,37,Chris Kaman,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Mason Plumlee,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Joel Freeland,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,18,Jarrett Jack,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,26,Steve Blake,1.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,16,Alan Anderson,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,13,CJ McCollum,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,10,Mirza Teletovic,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,13,Will Barton,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,Jorge Gutierrez,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2

												The Golden State Warriors (7-2) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (4-6) 112-87 on Saturday.Golden State is on a two-game win streak. They were up 67-46 on the Hornets at halftime, and the Hornets were never able to dig into the deficit in the second half. Klay Thompson scored a game-high 21 points in 27 minutes. The Warriors will go on the road to face the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.Charlotte was playing the second night of a back-to-back set. They beat the Phoenix Suns 103-95 on Friday, and with the way the Suns run, it's no surprise the Hornets didn't have enough in the tank to take on a rested Warriors squad.

												The Sacramento Kings (6-4) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (5-4) 94-91 on Saturday.Sacramento lost three straight games coming into their matchup with the Spurs, and it was starting to appear as though their hot start to the season was simply a streak of good luck. However, with a win over the NBA champions, the Kings have shown that they're going to try and earnestly fight for a playoff spot this season. They missed all 12 of their three-point attempts in this game, but the inside work of DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy and Darren Collison was enough to carry the team. Sacramento will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday for their next game.San Antonio saw their three-game win streak come to an end Saturday. If there's a singular reason the Spurs lost, the finger should be pointed at the 16 points they allowed the Kings to score off of 14 turnovers. San Antonio will host the winless Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (5-3) defeated the Phoenix Suns (5-5) 120-107 on Saturday.Los Angeles has been trading wins for losses lately. They began the season with a two-game win streak, but since then, the Clippers have recorded wins and losses like coin flips. Matt Barnes was moved back into the starting lineup at small forward, and Jamal Crawford moved back to a bench role. Both players played 27 minutes and were positive contributors in plus/minus. Los Angeles will host the Chicago Bulls on Monday before embarking on a seven-game roadtrip.Phoenix was playing the second night of a back-to-back, coming off a loss at home to the Charlotte Hornets. The Suns shot 38 percent from the field, while the Clippers converted 53 percent of their shots, a statistic that tells the game story simply. Phoenix began a six-game roadtrip Saturday, and their next game will be against the Celtics in Boston on Monday.

												The Denver Nuggets (2-6) went into Indiana and got their second win of the year, beating the Pacers (3-7) 108-87 on Friday night.The Nuggets fans are probably feeling a bit more relaxed after this one, since their loss on Thursday night to the Trail Blazers was just painful to watch. The Nuggets looked like a different team on Friday, as they had seven players score in double figures, and 11 players score in total. Ty Lawson led the charge, scoring 11 points (4-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT) to go with 10 assists, three rebounds and one steal. Head coach Brian Shaw spread his minutes out well on Friday, and is still in the midst of finding the right starting five. Denver now heads to New York to take on the Knicks Sunday.For the Pacers, it was just a tough outing. They were down by 25 going into the fourth quarter, and turned to their bench pretty early on in this one. A total of eight players saw 22 or more minutes on Friday night, and A.J. Price actually led the team in scoring off the bench, with 14 points (5-9 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-3 FT), four assists, two rebounds and one steal in 24 minutes. Big man Roy Hibbert was very quiet on Friday, scoring only nine points (3-9 FG, 3-4 FT) to go with four rebounds, two blocks and one assist. The Pacers will now head to Chicago on Saturday night.

												The Orlando Magic (4-6) put aside the second-half struggles they have had this season, and pulled away over the final 24 minutes to secure a 101-85 home victory over the Milwaukee Bucks (4-5) on Friday night.The Magic began to create separation mid-way through the third quarter, when Tobias Harris and Evan Fournier sparked a 13-2 run that saw Orlando's one-point lead extended to double-digits. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks on a fourth quarter charge, but Milwaukee was unable to come closer than seven points as the Magic came away with their fourth victory of the season.The Milwaukee loss comes in spite of a career night from Antetokounmpo, who notched a career-high 19 points on 9-of-15 shooting. Brandon Knight scored 24 to lead the Bucks, and also added six rebounds and five assists. Tobias Harris led the attack for Orlando with a 26-point, 10-rebound double-double. Victor Oladipo (face) made his season debut. He played 25 minutes off the bench and scored 13 points.The two teams shot similar percentages from the field, but Orlando was able to come away with the win based on a 10-24 shooting night from downtown while adding 21 points from the charity stripe. The Magic also controlled the boards, out-rebounding Milwaukee 45-38. 											",Orlando,Magic,Milwaukee,Bucks,Amway Center,4,5,4,6,10.0,24.0,35.0,79.0,21.0,27.0,45.0,22.0,15.0,2.0,19.0,34.0,76.0,11.0,14.0,37.0,17.0,15.0,Tobias Harris,10.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,10.0,18.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,37,Jabari Parker,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,27,Channing Frye,8.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,30,Ersan Ilyasova,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,13,Nikola Vucevic,9.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,33,Larry Sanders,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Evan Fournier,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,13.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,35,Jared Dudley,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Elfrid Payton,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,22,Brandon Knight,6.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,9.0,17.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,34,Luke Ridnour,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,17,Giannis Antetokounmpo,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,9.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,30,Aaron Gordon,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,O.J.

												The Atlanta Hawks (5-3) defeated the Miami Heat (5-4) 114-103 on Friday.Atlanta has won four straight games, and they've been without starting small forward DeMarre Carroll (groin) for the last two games. Thabo Sefolosha has been filling in admirably in Carroll's stead. Sefolosha finished with 12 points Friday. He was one of eight Hawks players to finish with double-digit points. Miami is on a two-game losing streak, but their struggles against the Hawks were explainable with Dwyane Wade sitting out with a minor hamstring injury. James Ennis received the spot start in place of Wade, but it was Mario Chalmers off the bench who showed up big. He had a double-double with a team-high 23 points and 11 assists in 40 mintues. Wade is questionable to play in the Heat's next game Sunday at home against the Milwaukee Bucks.The Hawks will finish off their back-to-back set Saturday in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (4-3) defeated the Boston Celtics (3-5) 122-121 on Friday.Cleveland has won three straight games after starting the season 1-3. Their offense is starting to fire on all cylinders with the Cavaliers scoring 110 points or more in each of their last three games. Dion Waiters sat out Monday's game against the New Orleans Pelicans with a back contusion, but he was able to return to action Friday.Last Saturday, Boston pulled off a win over the Chicago Bulls without Rajon Rondo in the lineup, but they've dropped two straight games since his return. Too much shouldn't be read into the correlation, but it's worth mentioning, because if the team doesn't like the direction they're heading with Rondo this season, he could end up on the trade block with his contract set to expire. The Celtics were up 17 points going into the fourth quarter, but a 38-point fourth for the Cavaliers helped them to complete the comeback behind a game-high 41 points from LeBron James.The Cavaliers will finish off a back-to-back set at home Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks. Boston has the next two days off before hosting the Phoenix Suns on Monday.

												The Utah Jazz (4-6) defeated the New York Knicks (2-8) 102-100 on Friday.The Jazz were coming off back-to-back losses heading into Friday's game, and their star player made sure they came away with a win. Gordon Hayward scored a season-high 33 points in 38 minutes. Utah has one more game on their five-game Eastern Conference road trip. They'll go on to Toronto to finish off their back-to-back set against the Raptors on Saturday.Carmelo Anthony's 46 points were impressive, but they weren't enough to earn the win for the Knicks. Only one other Knicks player, Pablo Prigioni scored in double-digits. Prigioni finished with 13 points in 29 minutes off the bench. New York is struggling to find their groove this season, and with defensive wing Iman Shumpert going down with right hip contusion Friday, they'll have another hurdle to jump. Shumpert is questionable for the Sunday's game against the Nuggets. They've lost seven straight games.

												The Houston Rockets (8-1) took down the Philadelphia 76ers (0-9) 88-87 at the Toyota Center on Friday night.Close, but no cigar for the Philadelphia 76ers. The Sixers were looking to grab their first win of the season, and nearly did so, losing by one to the Rockets. Philadelphia got a big game from Tony Wroten with 19 points (7-16 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-6 FT) to go with eight assists, four rebounds and one steal. The key for Philadelphia on Friday was simply being balanced across the board though, as 10 players scored. They rebounded the ball well and everyone did their part. Unfortunately, they couldn't overcome a fourth quarter run by the Rockets, as they were outscored 25-19 in the final quarter. Philadelphia will get the rest of the weekend off before heading to San Antonio to take on the Spurs.The Rockets got a huge game from James Harden, as he scored 35 points (10-24 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 14-16 FT) to go with seven assists, six rebounds, three steals and one block. He literally did everything for this team, and the Rockets only saw three players score in double figures on Friday. Dwight Howard had a nice game as well, posting a double-double with 21 points (9-14 FG, 3-12 FT) and 16 rebounds. Houston has been very impressive this year, and they look like a serious contender. The Rockets will get Saturday off, and they head to Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder on Sunday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans (5-3) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (2-6) 139-91 on Friday.Minnesota was playing without two of their veteran starters. Ricky Rubio will be out another 6-7 weeks with a serverely sprained left ankle, and Thaddeus Young is away from the team indefinitely to be with his family following the passing of his mother. Rookie Zach LaVine has been handed the starting point guard duties with Rubio out. LaVine started his third straight game and put up 13 points in 31 mintues. He didn't record a single assist in the game as the Timberwolves shot just 40 percent as a team. They'll continue their two-game road trip in Dallas on Saturday when they face the Mavericks.The Pelicans seem to be coming into their own this season now that they have the healthy roster they thought they were going to have last season. Jrue Holiday scored a team-high 24 points in 28 minutes, converting all but one of his field goal attempts as the Pelicans finished the game shooting 67 percent from the field. Coach Monty Williams was on the coaching hot seat coming into the season, but with Anthony Davis having the Pelicans looking like a playoff team, everyone should be smiling in New Orleans. They have two days off before embarking on a four-game road trip that begins in Portland on Monday against the Trail Blazers.

												The Detroit Pistons (3-6) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (3-7) 96-89 in overtime on Friday.Brandon Jennings paced the Pistons, scoring a team-high 29 points in 36 minutes. They had dropped three straight games before pulling out the win over the injury-depleted Thunder. Since being challenged by coach Stan Van Gundy to start being more aggressive on offense, Jennings has responded by looking for his shot earlier in games. The Pistons finish their four-game road trip in Memphis on Saturday against the Grizzlies.Despite playing without their two MVP-level players in Russell Westbrook (hand) and Kevin Durant (foot), the Thunder have competed realitively well. They're 2-2 in their last four games, and Reggie Jackson continues to put up All-Star numbers to try and show that he is indeed an All-Star caliber player when given the minutes and possessions to prove it. Jeremy Lamb bounced back from two poor games to score a team-high 24 points. The Thunder have a day off before hosting the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (4-5) defeated the Phoenix Suns (5-4) 103-95 on Friday.Charlotte was coming off two losses to the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers at the start of their current four-game Western Conference roadtrip. Kemba Walker scored a team-high 19 points in 33 minutes. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is going to miss at least two games with a stress reaction in his foot. Rookie P.J. Hairston earned the first start of his NBA career, filling in at small forward with Kidd-Gilchrist out. Marvin Williams was questionable for the game with knee soreness, but he was able to play and contributed 24 minutes as the starting power forward. The Hornets will finish off their road trip Saturday against the Golden State Warriors.Phoenix was on a five-game homestand that wrapped up with this loss to the Hornets. The Suns had all five starters finish in double-digits scoring, but they shot just 43 percent from the field. Phoenix's biggest gaff came from the 18 points they gave up off of turnovers in the game compared to the Hornets' eight. The Suns have another game Saturday. They'll face the Los Angeles Clippers on the road.

												The San Antonio Spurs (5-3) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (1-8) 93-80 on Friday.San Antonio has won three straight games. Every team on the Spurs' schedule through their first eight games is a projected playoff team, excluding the Lakers of course. Their schedule begins to loosen up some in the next couple weeks with the Spurs facing several lottery-bound teams.Los Angeles couldn't do anything on offense against the Spurs. The Lakers shot 37 percent from the field and 17 percent from beyond the arc. Kobe Bryant shot just 1-for-14 from the field to finish with a season-low nine points.The Spurs will finish off their current four-game roadtrip Saturday against the Kings in Sacramento.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (8-1) erased a 26-point deficit to knock off the Sacramento Kings (5-4) 111-110 on Thursday night at the FedExForum in Memphis.The Grizzlies were down big early in this one, but made a massive fourth quarter comeback, which was complete with a tip-in alley-oop by Courtney Lee with just 0.3 seconds left. Memphis started out slowly at home in this one, but finally got it going late, and they were led by an impressive double-double from Mike Conley, who had 22 points (8-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT), 11 assists, one rebound and one steal. The bench production was big for the Grizzlies, and they can not only thank Lee for the tip-in game winner, but also for his 16 points (6-9 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-3 FT), three assists, three steals and one rebound in 36 minutes. Memphis now gets a night off before taking on the Detroit Pistons at home Saturday.For the Kings, it was just a painful loss in a game that looked to be a blowout early on. Sacramento got solid production from four of their five starters, and DeMarcus Cousins posted yet another double-double, with 22 points (8-17 FG, 6-7 FT) and 12 rebounds. Rudy Gay led the team in scoring Thursday, and posted 25 points (8-17 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 8-8 FT), with seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. The Kings were off to a hot start at the beginning of the season, but have lost three straight now, and will look to turn things around when they head back home to take on the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday night.

												The Chicago Bulls (7-2) took down the Toronto Raptors (7-2) 100-93 on the road at the Air Canada Centre on Thursdsay night.The Bulls look to be the part of a serious contender to this point, and beating a strong team like the Raptors on the road just proves that. Chicago was led by an impressive team effort, and Pau Gasol posted yet another double-double with 27 points (12-19 FG, 3-4 FT), 11 rebounds, three blocks, two assists and one steal. Jimmy Butler also had a huge game, playing a total of 40 minutes and producing in a big way, scoring 21 points (7-10 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 6-8 FT) with nine rebounds, six assists and one block. The Bulls will now head back home and take on the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night.For the Raptors, they nearly got a triple-double from Kyle Lowry. He had 20 points (8-19 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 1-3 FT), eight rebounds and eight assists, but it just wasn't enough in the end. James Johnson also filled up the box score off the bench, scoring 16 points (7-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT) to go with five rebounds, four steals, four blocks and one assist in just 24 minutes. The Raptors get a night off before taking on the Utah Jazz on their home floor on Saturday night.

												The Dallas Mavericks (6-3) put on a complete show while beating the Philadelphia 76ers (0-8) by 53 on Thursday night 123-70 at the American Airlines Center.The Mavericks apparently were out for blood in this game, as they rolled over the 76ers from the word go. The Mavs outscored them 38-10 in the first quarter, and were up 73-29 at halftime. If Dallas hadn't taken their foot off the gas at points in this game, it probably could have been even worse. The Mavericks got everyone in on the action Thursday, with 13 players getting on the floor, and everyone scoring. They were led by Dirk Nowitzki in scoring with 21 points (7-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 6-7 FT) to go with four assists and three rebounds in only 20 minutes. The Mavs will now get a night off before taking on the Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Saturday night.This young 76ers team is still trying to find answers, and they couldn't get anything going on Thursday night. They shot a brutal 30 percent from the field, and 52 percent from the free-throw line. A total of two players scored in double figures, and it was the two point guards, Michael Carter-Williams and Tony Wroten. Carter-Williams was playing in his first game of the season, and he saw 30 minutes of action off the bench, scoring 19 points (6-19 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-10 FT) to go with eight rebounds and five assists. Wroten started the game and scored 11 points (3-7 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 3-6 FT) to go with four rebounds and two assists. The 76ers had better have a plan to get things turned around, as they're on the road in Houston on Friday night against the 7-1 Rockets.

												The Washington Wizards (6-2) held off the Detroit Pistons (2-6) 107-103 on Wednesday night at the Verizon Center in Washington, DC.It took a fourth quarter run to get the job done, but the Wizards extended their impressive start to the 2014 season. The team was led by John Wall, who had 27 points (7-19 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 13-16 FT), along with 11 assists, three rebounds, three steals and one block. Wall wasn't alone in this one though, as five players scored in double figures, and we saw a double-double from big man Marcin Gortat, with 14 points (7-12 FG, 0-2 FT) and 13 rebounds. Wednesday night's win was the second in a row for Washington, and their sixth over the last seven games. They now get a few days off before taking on the Orlando Magic at home on Saturday night.The Pistons had three players in double figures, with all three having impressive nights. Brandon Jennings led the way with his double-double, which included 32 points (11-19 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 7-9 FT) and 10 assists. Greg Monroe fell just short of his own double-double, posting a stat line of 18 points (6-13 FG, 6-7 FT), and nine rebounds. Detroit's third big scorer was a more surprising one, as Kentavious Caldwell-Pope got his shot to fall on Wednesday, scoring 20 points (8-14 FG, 4-6 3Pt). The Pistons are off to a slow start to the 2014 season, with this being their third loss in a row. Detroit gets a night off before taking on the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road on Friday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks (4-3) completed a fourth quarter comeback to beat the Utah Jazz (3-6) 100-97 on Wednesday night at Philips Arena.The Jazz found themselves up by six heading into the fourth quarter, but things didn't quite go as planned. Utah scored only nine points in the fourth, and were out-scored 18-9 to lose by three when all was said and done. Utah was led by a strong all-around showing in terms of scoring, as six players scored in double figures. Despite the scoring balance, it still just wasn't enough. Alec Burks lead the way with 22 points (9-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT), to go along with three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Trey Burke posted a double-double for the Jazz, with 11 points (5-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt) and 11 assists. It was his first double-double of the year. The Jazz have now dropped two straight, and will head to New York to take on the Knicks Friday.The Hawks have to be happy to walk away with the win after scoring just 18 points in the fourth quarter. They did the job on the defensive end though, which allowed them to get over the .500 mark on the year. This was Atlanta's third win in a row, and they got a monster game from Paul Millsap, who had 30 points (13-23 FG, 4-8 3Pt), along with 17 rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Kyle Korver also posted a double-double, with 17 points (5-10 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and 10 rebounds. He also chipped in six assists in 38 minutes. Atlanta will now get a night off before taking on the Miami Heat at home on Friday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (3-6) got their first road win of the season, beating the Boston Celtics (3-4) 109-94 at the TD Garden on Wednesday.Depite playing without Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook, the Thunder were still able to get the job done. They showed up big on Wednesday, grabbing a 15-point win over the Celtics. Oklahoma City was led by a big game from Reggie Jackson, who had 28 points (8-15 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 10-10 FT), along with eight assists, three rebounds and one steal. They also got an impressive performance off the bench from Anthony Morrow, who scored 28 points (11-16 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT), with five rebounds and one assist.

												The Indiana Pacers (3-6) got an impressive road win over the Miami Heat (5-3) 81-75 at the American Airlines Arena on Wednesday.It may not have been Paul George vs. LeBron James, but the Pacers still got a solid win over a talented Heat team. This was a low scoring game, but the Pacers were led by an impressive double-double from Roy Hibbert, with 16 points (7-14 FG, 2-2 FT) and 15 rebounds. He also was able to post three blocks and two steals. Chris Copeland continued to score in bunches, as he had another 17 points Wednesday. Only three players scored in double figures for the Pacers, but it didn't matter in the end, as everyone who got in the game were able to add to the stellar defensive effort. Indiana has now won two games in a row, and they'll head back home to take on the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.For the Heat, it was the Dwyane Wade show, as only he and Shawne Williams scored in double figures. Wade had 20 points (8-16 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-7 FT), with four rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. The Pacers' defense really locked in on the Heat in this game, and even forced Chris Bosh to have a tough night offensively, as he only scored nine points (3-13 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 2-3 FT), to go along with three assists, three steals, two rebounds and one block. Miami will look to get back to their winning ways on Friday night, as they'll be on the road facing the Atlanta Hawks.

												The Orlando Magic (3-6) traveled to Madison Square Garden and took down the New York Knicks (2-7) 97-95 on Wednesday night.This one was a battle of 2-6 teams, with both looking to get one game closer to the .500 mark. The Magic showed up when it mattered most on Wednesday night, outscoring the Knicks by four in the fourth quarter to get the two point victory. Evan Fournier led the scoring output for Orlando, as he finished with 28 points (8-14 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 10-14 FT), four steals, two assists and two rebounds as well. The points total was a season-high for the guard. Nikola Vucevic added an impressive double-double with 20 points (8-15 FG, 4-4 FT) and 13 rebounds. He's now combined for 65 points in the last three games and continues to provide consistent scoring and rebounds. The Magic snapped a two game losing streak with this win, and now head back home to take on the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night.It's been a painful start to the 2014 season for Carmelo Anthony and company, and this loss had to be tough to swallow. Anthony led the way with 27 points (10-17 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 5-6 FT), to go along with five rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Aside from J.R. Smith, every other player on the team had 10 points or fewer, as Smith had 19 points (6-16 FG, 3-8 3Pt, 4-4 FT), while also contributing four rebounds and three assists off the bench. New York is still trying to find their identity, and this was their sixth loss in a row, after a promising 2-1 start to the year. The Knicks remain at home, and get a day off before taking on the Utah Jazz on Friday night.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (6-3) defeated the Denver Nuggets (1-6) 130-113 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver.The Blazers were scorching hot from the beginning of this game, torching the Nuggets for 84 points in the first half. They shot 51 percent from the field and 49 percent from behind the three-point line, to give them a season-high scoring total of 130 points. Despite out-rebounding the Trail Blazers and having less turnovers, the Nuggets just couldn't keep the Blazers from scoring at will.This was the second matchup this week between the two teams. After LaMarcus Aldridge and Wesley Matthews did most of the damage on Sunday, it was Damian Lillard and Robin Lopez who led the charge Wednesday. Lillard finished the game with 27 points and nine assists. He shot 10-for-16 from the field and 5-for-6 from beyond the arc. Lopez contributed 19 points of his own (8-11 FG, 3-3 FT), while also adding five rebounds. The Blazers had plenty of help off the bench with Chris Kaman and C.J. McCollum combining for 31 points on 10-for-15 shooting from the floor. This was Kaman's third game in a row scoring double figures off the bench. Taking Nicolas Batum's spot in the starting lineup, the inexperienced Allen Crabbe totaled seven points in 17 minutes. The Nuggets were led by Ty Lawson, who scored 32 points (11-17 FG, 4-5 3Pt, 6-7 FT), while dishing out six assists. The 32 points was a season-high for Lawson. J.J. Hickson continued to receive minutes in his second game of the season after returning from suspension. He posted his first double-double of the year, going for 14 points and 11 rebounds in 21 minutes. Kenneth Faried had a relatively quiet game as he only scored 10 points and pulled in four rebounds.

												The Houston Rockets (7-1) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (2-5) 113-101 on Wednesday in Mexico City. Despite the Rockets playing so well this season, the inexperienced Timberwolves held tough and gave the Rockets a good fight. The Rockets had a big third quarter where they outscored the Timberwolves 31-21 to gain the advantage in an otherwise evenly played game. Minnesota has now dropped three games in a row, while Houston rebounded with a victory after their first loss of the season to the Warriors on Saturday. Even without starting point guard Patrick Beverley and power forward Terrence Jones, the Rockets' big three were able to have enough production to get the victory. James Harden recorded a double-double, scoring 23 points (8-23 FG, 2-8 3Pt) and adding 10 assists. Harden has only scored below 20 points once this season, as he makes his case for league MVP. Dwight Howard added a double-double of his own, posting 22 points and 10 rebounds. He's now recorded six double-doubles in seven games and is averaging 19.7 points and 11.5 rebounds on the year. Trevor Ariza also had his shot falling in this game, going 7-for-12 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to score 19 points. He's shooting 48 percent from beyond the arc this season. The Timberwolves were led by Corey Brewer, who came off the bench to go a perfect 7-for-7 from the field and 1-for-1 from the three-point line. He scored 18 points in 24 minutes. It was his highest scoring output of the season after only reaching double digits once this season before Wednesday. Rookie Andrew Wiggins was able to score 15 points, but didn't do much else for the Wolves, as he only recorded one rebound and a block. He's starting to get more comfortable with his offensive game now that he's seven games into the season. Nikola Pekovic notched his fourth double-double of the season as he finished with 11 points and 13 rebounds. He's averaging 14.4 points and 9.1 rebounds on the year. The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Friday.

												The Toronto Raptors (7-1) held off the Orlando Magic (2-6) on Tuesday night at the Air Canada Centre with a final score of 104-100.The Raptors have looked the part of a team that you don't want to mess with when playoff time rolls around, at least to this point in 2014. Toronto saw the Magic come to town on Tuesday night and give them a major fight, but they managed to walk away with their fifth home win (5-0) of the season after out-scoring the Magic 32 to 17 in the fourth quarter. The Raptors got a strong all-around performance on Tuesday, including six players scoring in double figures, with Kyle Lowry leading the way with 19 points (8-16 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 2-2 FT). He also tacked on seven assists, six rebounds and three steals. Toronto gets a night off now before playing another home game against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday night.The Magic lost their second straight game, but fought hard to the finish, and nearly pulled the upset. Evan Fournier led the way with 24 points (9-18 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 2-4 FT), with three steals, two assists and two rebounds. The most well-rounded performance for the Magic though, will go to youngster Tobias Harris, who scored 23 points (8-16 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 5-5 FT), to go along with 13 rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. Orlando will look to head in the right direction tomorrow night, as they travel to New York to take on the Knicks.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (7-1) were able to hold off a late push from the Los Angeles Lakers (1-6) with a finishing score of 107-102 for their seventh win of the season.The Lakers just can't seem to get over the hump, and are off to a tough start through their first seven games of the season. Even with Kobe Bryant lighting up the box score with 28 points (10-26 FG, 3-10 3Pt, 5-6 FT), to go along with seven rebounds, six assists and four steals, it just wasn't enough. The Lakers got some solid production from their starters, with all five players scoring in double figures, but the bench totaled just 14 points in the loss. Jordan Hill posted a double-double with 13 points (6-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 14 rebounds, while also contributing three assists, two steals and two blocks. The Lakers now head to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on Wednesday.The Grizzlies on the other hand are looking like a serious contender right now, and a large part of that is thanks to their consistency across the board. Six players scored in double figures, but every player who was on the floor contributed in some manner when they were out there. Mike Conley led the way scoring 23 points (7-16 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 7-7 FT), with three assists, three steals and one rebound. Even the lone starter who didn't score in double figures, Marc Gasol, nearly had a triple-double, with eight points (3-10 FG, 2-2 FT), nine assists and eight rebounds. The Grizzlies get a night off before taking on the Sacramento Kings at home on Thursday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (4-4) got their record up to .500 by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder (2-6) 85-78 on Tuesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center.The Thunder just can't seem to get the ball rolling right now, but it's understandable since they're currently without two of the best players in the NBA in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Reggie Jackson and Serge Ibaka did everything they could, with Jackson scoring 29 points (12-21 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-3 FT), to go along with four rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block, and Ibaka posting 14 points (4-13 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT), with seven rebounds, two assists and one block. In the end though, the Bucks just had more bench proudction which allowed the Bucks to stop the Thunder from stealing a road win. Oklahoma City now heads to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday.The Bucks may have only had one player score in double figures from their starting lineup in Brandon Knight, who scored 16 points (6-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-5 FT), with four assists, four rebounds and one steal, but the bench picked up the slack. Milwaukee had 53 bench points in this game, and were led by 19 points (6-15 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 5-7 FT) and four rebounds from O.J. Mayo. Giannis Antetokounmpo also had a big night, nearly posting a double-double, with 14 points (6-13 FG, 2-4 FT), and nine rebounds. The Bucks will look to get above .500 on Friday night when they head on the road to Orlando to play the Magic.

												The Dallas Mavericks proved to be too much to handle for the Sacramento Kings Tuesday night at the America Airlines Center, winning 106-98.The Kings got off to a fast start, led by Rudy Gay, accumulating a lead as high as 24 points in the first half.  Dallas promptly responded though, battling back to cut the deficit to nine, as the buzzer sounded signifying the end of the second quarter. Gay tallied a line of 26 points (7-14 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 11-13 FT), eight rebounds, eight assists, and two steals while turning the ball over seven times.Monta Ellis was held scoreless in the first half, but was a huge factor in the second half finishing with 16 points (7-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 1-3 FT). Maverick's superstar Dirk Nowitzki registered a team-high 23 points (7-12 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 7-8 FT), seven rebounds, three assists, and a block with two turnovers. The future hall of famer certainly did the heavy lifting Tuesday, against a Kings team looking to regain their form after a tough loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder Monday.Thursday, the Dallas Mavericks look ahead to their next game against the Philadelphia 76ers while the Sacramento Kings will go on the road Thursday to take on the Memphis Grizzlies in their next matchup.

												The Charlotte Hornets (3-5) were outscored 27-15 in the fourth quarter by the Portland Trail Blazers (5-3) on Tuesday at the Moda Center in Portland and took a 102-100 loss.The Hornets were up big early on in this one, reaching a 23 point lead in the first half, while eventually going into halftime up 13. Charlotte just couldn't hold on to the lead though, and ended up losing a close one on the road in Portland. The Hornets were led by a double-double from Lance Stephenson with 14 points (5-10 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 2-4 FT) and 14 rebounds. Charlotte had a well-balanced attack offensively, with eight total players scoring, and each of them scoring at least seven points. Brian Roberts chipped in 12 points (4-7 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) in only 12 minutes of action, while Kemba Walker struggled to knock down his shot, scoring 16 points on 6-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt and 3-4 FT. The Hornets continue their tough road stretch against the Phoenix Suns on Friday night.The Trail Blazers came storming back in this one, and did so in impressive fashion. Portland was led by their dynamic duo of Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge, but got solid production from multiple players on Tuesday night. Lillard scored 29 points (12-21 FG, 5-8 3Pt), with seven assists, four rebounds and two steals, while Aldridge scored 25 points (10-21 FG, 5-5 FT), with 14 rebounds and three assists. The Blazers have won two in a row now, and head on the road to take on the Nuggets tomorrow night in Denver.

												The Golden State Warriors fell to the San Antonio Spurs 113-100 Thursday at the ORACLE Arena, despite shooting an impressive 54 percent from the field.In the second game of a back-to-back, coach Gregg Popovich uncharacteristically opted to play his veterans, and it paid off in a big way. Tim Duncan had himself a double-double in the contest, with 12 points (5-13 FG, 2-3 FT) and 13 rebounds; he added three assists and two turnovers, while turning the ball over once. Tony Parker posted an equally impressive line of 28 points (11-17 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 4-4 FT), seven assists, one rebound, and one turnover in 30 minutes of action.Warriors' guard Klay Thompson exploded Thursday for 29 points (9-17 FG, 5-6 3Pt, 6-6 FT). His effort wasn't enough, though, as Golden State turned the ball over way too frequently, finishing with a total of 19 as a team. Harrison Barnes chipped in with a season-high 22 points (9-12 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and Stephen Curry added 16 (7-18 FG, 0-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT). Curry did not score in the second half.The San Antonio Spurs attempted an astounding 23 more shots from the field than the Golden State Warriors in this matchup.The Warriors will play next at home against the Brooklyn Nets Thursday, while the Spurs will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,San Antonio,Spurs,Chase Center,4,3,5,2,7.0,20.0,33.0,65.0,16.0,18.0,36.0,23.0,18.0,10.0,24.0,46.0,92.0,11.0,15.0,36.0,28.0,8.0,Harrison Barnes,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,9.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,38,Kawhi Leonard,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,35,Draymond Green,4.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,31,Tim Duncan,13.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Andrew Bogut,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Matt Bonner,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,23,Klay Thompson,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,29.0,9.0,17.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,39,Danny Green,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,25,Stephen Curry,6.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,18.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,35,Tony Parker,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,28.0,11.0,17.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,30,Andre Iguodala,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,22,Kyle Anderson,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,Festus Ezeli,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Manu Ginobili,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,17.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,25,Leandro Barbosa,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Aron Baynes,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,Shaun Livingston,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Cory Joseph,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19,Brandon Rush,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3,Boris Diaw,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,22

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (3-3) took down the New Orleans Pelicans (3-3) 118-111 on Monday night at the Quicken Loans Arena.All of the sudden, the Cavaliers find themselves back at the .500 mark after a slow start to the season. This win for LeBron James and company came over Anthony Davis and the up-and-coming New Orleans Pelicans. The Cavaliers were led by none other than James, who had an impressive triple-double, with 32 points (9-17 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 13-17 FT), 12 rebounds and 10 assists in 40 minutes. Kyrie Irving had an impressive game as well, putting up 32 points (11-21 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 6-7 FT), with nine assists and five rebounds in 41 minutes. The Cavaliers will get a few days off before heading to Boston to take on the Celtics on Friday night.The Pelicans received a big boost off of the bench from Ryan Anderson on Monday night, as he scored 32 points (11-19 FG, 8-12 3Pt, 2-2 FT), with five rebounds, three assists and one steal in 34 minutes off the bench. We can't overlook the strong play of Anthony Davis once again either, as he had 27 points (12-21 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 3-4 FT), with 14 rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks in 40 minutes. The Pelicans are heading back home next, and they'll be taking on Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night.

												The Indiana Pacers (2-6) snapped a six-game winning streak, knocking off the Utah Jazz 97-86 on Monday night.The Pacers are currently without four starters, but it was the only starter who's left that led the charge Monday. Roy Hibbert put up 29 points (11-21 FG, 7-7 FT) with five rebounds, one assist, one block and one steal in 33 minutes. Indiana badly needed to find a way to get the win, as dropping to 1-7 would have been a difficult hole to climb out of. The Pacers got an impressive contribution from newly-signed A.J. Price, who scored 22 points (8-12 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT) in 25 minutes off the bench. Starting point guard Donald Sloan, filling in for George Hill (knee) struggled mightily, contributing just two points on 1-of-9 shooting.For the Jazz, it's a disappointing double-digit loss to a vastly depleted team. Utah got an impressive performance from Gordon Hayward, who finished with 30 points (11-15 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 6-6 FT) and added eight rebounds and five assists. While Hayward, Derrick Favors and Enes Kanter all scored in double figures, no other player on the team was able to do so, and the bench unit shot just 3-of-13 from the field.Next up, Utah remains on the road, heading to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Wednesday night. The Pacers travel to Miami to take on the new-look Heat in a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference Finals.

												The Atlanta Hawks (3-3) went to New York and beat the Knicks (2-6) 91-85 on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.The Hawks got a strong road win to even up their record at 3-3 on the year, and they have a well-rounded offensive performance to thank for it. Every player who touched the floor for the Hawks ended up scoring, and they were led by 19 points (6-14 FG, 3-4 3Pt, 4-4 FT) in 34 minutes from Paul Millsap. Kyle Korver also had a strong night, scoring 17 points (4-13 FG, 3-9 3Pt, 6-6 FT), with eight rebounds and two assists in 33 minutes. The Hawks now head back home to take on the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.The Knicks just couldn't get it going offensively, and have now lost five straight games, including back to back losses to the Hawks. New York was led by none other than All-Star Carmelo Anthony, who had 25 points (11-25 FG, 0-5 3Pt, 3-5 FT) with nine rebounds and seven assists in 42 minutes.

												The Chicago Bulls (6-2) beat the Detroit Pistons (2-5) 102-91 on Monday night at the United Center in Chicago.The Bulls are off to an impressive start to 2014, and a large part of that has been due to a major team effort on the offensive end. While Derrick Rose led the team in scoring with 24 points (9-20 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-5 FT) and seven assists, the Bulls got production from all over. Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah both posted double-doubles, with Gasol putting up 17 points (8-17 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) to go with 15 rebounds, four assists, four blocks and one steal. Noah posted 13 points (5-13 FG, 3-4 FT) with 14 rebounds and six assists. The Bulls look to keep their winning ways rolling as they head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Thursday night.For the Pistons, they just couldn't dig themselves out of a first half hole, and have lost two in a row now. Detroit only played eight players in this game, and while seven of the eight scored at least nine points, no one scored more than 19. Both Josh Smith and Greg Monroe had double-double's, with Smith collecting 11 rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Monroe scored 16 points (8-15 FG) to go with 10 rebounds and two assists. The Pistons now look to right the ship as they'll head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Wednesday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs (3-3) beat the Los Angeles Clippers (4-3) 89-85 on Monday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The Spurs made a rally in the fourth, outscoring the Clippers 25-15 to complete the comeback and steal an impressive road win on Monday night. The Spurs were led by the impressive all-around game from Kawhi Leonard, who had 26 points (10-18 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-5 FT) with 10 rebounds, three assists, three steals and one block in 37 minutes. Tim Duncan also posted a double-double, with a stat line that included 18 points (6-14 FG, 6-8 FT) 11 rebounds, three assists and one block in 36 minutes. The Spurs now head to Golden State to take on the Warriors on Tuesday night.For the Clippers, it was a disappointing loss that they let slip away. Los Angeles saw four of their five starters score in double figures, but outside of Blake Griffin with 23 points (9-17 FG, 5-7 FT), no single player scored more than 13. Griffin chipped in 10 rebounds, six assists and one steal as well in 37 minutes, putting together an impressive night. Chris Paul nearly finished with a triple-double, falling just one assist short, and had 12 points (6-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt) with 10 rebounds and nine assists in 39 minutes. The Clippers are now off until Saturday, when they take on the Phoenix Suns at the Staples Center.

												The Brooklyn Nets (4-2) defeated the Orlando Magic (2-5) 104-96 on Sunday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Magic shot 52 percent from the field and 53 percent from behind the arc compared to the Nets 48 percent from the field and 28 percent from three-point. The Nets were able to out-rebound the Magic 45 to 31, with Mason Plumlee leading the way as he recorded a team-leading 10. This win marks the second consecutive victory for Brooklyn as they now sit one game out of first place behind the Toronto Raptors, who they'll play Wednesday in an attempt to  take a share of the lead in the Atlantic Division.The Nets got a huge contribution out of starting shooting guard, Bojan Bogdanovic. He shot 9-for-12 from the field and 2-for-3 from the three-point line, finishing with a team-high 22 points and six rebounds. Considering he's only reached double figures in points once this season, it was an unexpected season-high for Bogdanovic. Deron Williams was the next highest scorer, as he added 18 points and seven assists, which is right on par with his season averages of 19.8 points and seven assists. Coming off the bench, Plumlee turned in his first double-double of the season with 12 points and 10 rebounds in only 16 minutes. Joe Johnson struggled to find his shot, and hit only five of his 14 shots from the field to add 13 points in 32 minutes. The Magic continued to see Nikola Vucevic shine, as he recorded his fifth double-double of the season, going off for 27 points and 12 rebounds. He's now averaging 17.2 points and 12.3 rebounds on the year. Evan Fournier, who's still filling in for Victor Oladipo, continued to do a stand up job and finished with 19 points on 6-of-9 shooting from the field and 2-of-2 from three-point land. After coming off one of his best games of the year against Minnesota when he finished with 15 points and four assists, Elfrid Payton came back down to earth and only provided two points (1-5 FG). It wasn't all bad though, as he did chip in six assists. Tobias Harris was uncharacteristicly quiet, as he shot only 4-for-13 from the field for 11 points.     The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Magic will go on the road to Toronto to play the Raptors on Tuesday. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Orlando,Magic,Barclays Center,2,5,4,2,,,,,,,,,,8.0,15.0,39.0,75.0,10.0,16.0,31.0,25.0,17.0,Joe Johnson,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,32,Tobias Harris,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,35,Kevin Garnett,8.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,28,Channing Frye,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,33,Brook Lopez,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,25,Nikola Vucevic,12.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,27.0,13.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32,Bojan Bogdanovic,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,9.0,12.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,31,Evan Fournier,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,33,Deron Williams,4.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,40,Elfrid Payton,0.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,28,Mirza Teletovic,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,19,Maurice Harkless,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,14,Jarrett Jack,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Luke Ridnour,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,19,Alan Anderson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,22,Ben Gordon,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,7,Mason Plumlee,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Aaron Gordon,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,Jorge Gutierrez,,,,,,,,,,,,Willie Green,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,19

												The Charlotte Hornets (3-4) had a brutal third quarter to lose to the Los Angeles Lakers (1-5) on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The Hornets were fresh off of a double-overtime thriller that featured a crazy bank-shot three from Lance Stephenson to give them the win. They didn't have much time to rest, and it seemed that their legs started to give in a bit during the second half of this one, as they were oustcored 65-41 over the span of the final two quarters. The Hornets were led by 23 points (10-23 FG, 3-6 FT) from Al Jefferson, as well as eight rebounds, one assist and one steal. The Hornets went deep into the bench in this one, but it wasn't enough. They now head to Portland on Tuesday to take on the Trail Blazers.For the Lakers, it's a sigh of relief getting to put one in the win column. They had a well-rounded team effort in this game, with five players scoring in double figures, and nine players scoring in total. The team was led by 21 points (7-20 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 6-7 FT) with six rebounds, four assists and one steal from Kobe Bryant, as well as 21 points (8-12 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 2-2 FT), with seven assists, three rebounds and a steal from Jeremy Lin. With the Lakers officially in the win column, they now head on the road to take on the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night.

												The Utah Jazz (3-4) defeated the Detroit Pistons (2-4) 97-96 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills.After trailing by five points going into the fourth quarter, the Jazz were able to outscore the Pistons 23-17 to finish the game and steal a victory in Detroit. The Jazz shot 46 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three-point line compared to the Pistons who shot only 39 percent from the field and 26 percent from beyond the arc. The Jazz were also able to get to the line 10 more times than the Pistons, which gave them just enough of an edge to get the one-point victory.Utah spread the points around in a total team-effort victory. Enes Kanter and Derrick Favors both recorded double-doubles. It was Favors' third on the year, as he finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds, while Kanter contributed his first of the season with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Gordon Hayward scored 17 points of his own, shooting 5-for-13 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line. He led all scorers for the Jazz. Alec Burks also reached double figures, shooting 6-for-13 from the field to finish with 14 points and four assists. With Rodney Hood sitting out with plantar fasciitis in his foot, rookie Dante Exum soaked up the majority of his playing time, as he had nine points and recorded five assits in 20 minutes.The Pistons got their biggest contribution from Brandon Jennings. He finished the game shooting 8-for-15 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc for 23 points and five assists. Jennings struggled to begin the season with two four-point games in a row, but he's gotten into a groove lately and has now reached double figures in four straight games. Andre Drummond had a huge game on the boards as he finished with 18 rebounds. Greg Monroe wasn't far behind with 11 rebounds of his own, and the pair helped the Pistons out-rebound Utah 51 to 43. Monroe also had 19 points, as the team continues to play their big lineup with Kyle Singler coming of the bench. Josh Smith reached double figures in scoring as he produced 13 points, while also coming one rebound shy of a double-double with nine.       The Pistons' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Monday, while the Jazz will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Monday.  											",Oklahoma City,Thunder,Sacramento,Kings,Chesapeake Energy Arena,5,2,2,5,,,,,,,,,,6.0,22.0,34.0,75.0,13.0,19.0,35.0,22.0,10.0,Lance Thomas,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30,Rudy Gay,10.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,19.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,37,Serge Ibaka,9.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,14.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,35,Jason Thompson,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28,Steven Adams,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,22,DeMarcus Cousins,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,16.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Jeremy Lamb,9.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,13.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,34,Ben McLemore,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,27,Reggie Jackson,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,6.0,19.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,41,Darren Collison,5.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,34,Kendrick Perkins,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Nik Stauskas,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,15,Nick Collison,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,25,Carl Landry,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Sebastian Telfair,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,5.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,17,Ramon Sessions,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,13,Ish Smith,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Reggie Evans,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Perry Jones III,,,,,,,,,,,,Ray McCallum,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4

												The Sacramento Kings (5-2) were beaten by the injury-plagued Oklahoma City Thunder (2-5) 101-93 on Sunday night at the Chesapeake Energy Arena.The Kings have been a pleasant surprise to this point in the 2014 season, but lost one on the road to a Thunder team who is dealing with all kinds of injury issues. This is a team who definitely has some serious talent in players like DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay, for starters. Cousins put up 16 points (7-15 FG, 2-5 FT), with seven rebounds, four steals, two blocks and an assist, but had some foul troubles. Gay was the Kings' leading scorer on Sunday though, and posted a double-double with 23 points (9-19 FG, 1-6 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and 10 rebounds. He also chipped in six assists with two steals as well. The Kings are going to be on the road Tuesday against the Dallas Mavericks next.Not only are the Thunder without Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, but they've been forced to sign players just to have enough bench players to feel confident about their depth. Their most recent signing was Ish Smith, who played eight minutes and scored seven points (2-2 FG, 3-3 FT) with one assist. The Thunder were led offensively by point guard Reggie Jackson, who scored 22 points (6-19 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 9-10 FT), to go along with six assists and two rebounds. The Thunder used as much firepower as they had to beat the Kings, with nine players getting in on the action. The return of Jeremy Lamb recently has been a welcomed one, as he scored 17 points (5-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) with nine rebounds and four assists. The Thunder will head to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks on Tuesday night next.

												The Philadelphia 76ers (0-7) couldn't snap the losing streak, getting dominated by the Toronto Raptors (6-1) 120-88 on Sunday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.This game was simply a tough one for the 76ers, as they lost by 32 points, and couldn't get much to go their way. They were without Nerlens Noel (ankle) in this one, and while the bench managed to score 44 points, the starters couldn't all do their part. The team was led in scoring by Tony Wroten with 18 points (6-16 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 5-7 FT), and he chipped in five assists, three rebounds and a steal as well. Philadelphia also got solid production from big man Henry Sims with 12 points (5-11 FG, 2-2 FT), eight rebounds, three assists and one steal. The 76ers are off until Thursday, when they head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki.The Raptors on the other side saw production come from all over the place, including deep into the bench. A total of 11 players scored for Toronto, and 13 players saw time on the court. DeMar DeRozan, who's off to a hot start in 2014 led the way with 24 points (8-12 FG, 8-8 FT), while adding six rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block in only 26 minutes. Greivis Vasquez led the bench in minutes with 26, and made the most of his time on the court, scoring 13 points (5-11 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT), to go along with six assists, four rebounds and a steal. The Raptors are now 4-0 at home this year, and they'll get a day off before taking on the Orlando Magic at the Air Canada Centre on Tuesday.

												The Miami Heat (5-2) took down the Dallas Mavericks (4-3) 105-96 at the American Airlines Center on Sunday.The Heat didn't need LeBron James to take down the Mavericks on Sunday night, as it was newly acquired Luol Deng who led the charge with 30 points (13-19 FG, 4-9 3Pt, 0-2 FT), to go along with five rebounds, four assists and one steal. The Heat have gotten off on the right foot to start 2014, and the two players left from the ""big three"" stepped up once again in this win, with Chris Bosh posting a double-double of 20 points (7-10 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 6-11 FT) and 10 rebounds, while also dishing out five assists. Dwyane Wade had a double-double of his own, with 20 points (9-18 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-2 FT) and 10 assists. The Heat head back home to take on the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night.The Mavericks couldn't use the home court to their advantage in this game, even though they had five players score in double figures. Tyson Chandler had a big double-double with 16 points (7-10 FG, 2-3 3Pt) and 15 rebounds, while Monta Ellis chipped in 23 points (8-14 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 5-6 FT) with five assists. Dallas had a few players really struggle shooting the ball though, as Chandler Parsons scored just four points (1-9 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 2-2 FT), and J.J. Barea had only three points (1-9 FG, 1-3 3Pt). The Mavericks are at home once again on Tuesday night against the Sacramento Kings.

												The Phoenix Suns (4-3) gave the Golden State Warriors (5-1) their first loss on the year Sunday with the score finishing at 107-95, at the US Airways Center.No one is doubting the talent that the Suns have this year, and that includes the Warriors after losing by double digits to them on Sunday. The Warriors got solid production from four of their starting five, but couldn't get much bench production, which ended up making a big difference. Golden State was led by 28 points (10-20 FG, 4-10 3Pt, 4-4 FT) from Stephen Curry, as well as 10 assists and five steals. Curry had a tough night with turning the ball over though, as the Suns' defense was all over him consistently throughout the game. Draymond Green nearly posted his own double-double, putting up 22 points (7-14 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT), to go along with nine rebounds, four blocks and one steal.The Suns really saw their scoring spread out across the board with 10 players giving contributions, while also receiving solid production from their bench. The two players specifically who stepped up off the bench for Phoenix included Isaiah Thomas, who had 22 points (4-13 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 13-14 FT) with seven assists, three rebounds and one steal, and Gerald Green, who had 19 points (6-12 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 3-3 FT). The Suns now get to stay home for their game against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night.

												The Denver Nuggets (1-5) lost their fifth straight game, this time against the Portland Trail Blazers (4-3) on Sunday night at the Moda Center in Portland.The Nuggets just can't seem to get the ball rolling to this point in 2014. While they semeed to stick with their starting lineup in this game (to some extent, at least), they still lost another game, and this one was by a large margin. Ty Lawson did a little bit of everything for Denver, with 18 points (7-16 FG, 4-6 FT), eight assists, six rebounds, and two steals, but it wasn't enough. The Nuggets saw only three players score in double figures, but a total of 10 players score at some point during the game. Denver heads home next, but they'll be taking on this same Portland team on Wednesday night.For the Trail Blazers, it was just one of those nights where things were clicking. They saw six players score in double figures, and four players pull down at least eight rebounds. Portland crashed the glass hard, and were led in scoring by LaMarcus Aldridge, who had 28 points (12-26 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT), to go along with nine rebounds, four assists, one block and one steal. The Blazers' ability to move the ball around was huge, as the tallied 27 assists as a team, compared to just 14 for the Nuggets. Nicolas Batum was being looked to by the medical staff after the game, but it is unclear what his injury is. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Charlotte,Hornets,Staples Center,3,4,1,5,6.0,17.0,42.0,82.0,17.0,22.0,38.0,28.0,11.0,3.0,14.0,34.0,78.0,17.0,25.0,39.0,15.0,10.0,Wesley Johnson,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,35,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Carlos Boozer,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,Marvin Williams,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,29,Jordan Hill,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Al Jefferson,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,10.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,33,Kobe Bryant,6.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,20.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,34,Lance Stephenson,11.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,12.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,34,Jeremy Lin,3.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,32,Kemba Walker,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Ronnie Price,2.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,17,PJ Hairston,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,9,Ed Davis,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Cody Zeller,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Wayne Ellington,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,19,Jason Maxiell,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Xavier Henry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,Gary Neal,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,24,Robert Sacre,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Brian Roberts,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11

												The Los Angeles Clippers (4-2) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (3-3) 106-102 on Saturday.The Clippers were paced by J.J. Redick's 30 points, but they also had big contributions from Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, and Chris Paul. Griffin scored 23 points, and Paul had a double-double of 22 points and 11 assists. Crawford was moved into the starting lineup in place of Matt Barnes to try and give the Clippers more talent in their starting lineup. Crawford finished with 20 points in 31 minutes in his first start of the season. Glen Davis made his season debut after having sat out the first five games of the season with a groin injury. He played nine minutes off the bench.After struggling through his first three games of the season, Damian Lillard has caught fire over the last week. He did his best to ignite a comeback for the Blazers on Saturday, but his flourish of scores down the stretch were clouded by a few poor decisions by Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge that kept the win out of reach. Aldridge finished with a double-double of 21 points and 10 rebounds, while all five Blazers starters finished with double-digits scoring. The Trail Blazers will finish off a back-to-back set at home Sunday against the Nuggets. The Clippers will host the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.

												The Wizards (5-2) rebounds from a loss to Toronto on Friday, knocking off the Pacers (1-6) for the second time in four nights.Washington, which won in Indianapolis on Wednesday night, jumped out to a big first quarter lead en route to the 97-90 victory. The Wizards led 32-14 after one and held a 19-point lead at the half. The Pacers would come storming back, however, trimming the lead to single digits by the end of the third.

												The Heat (4-2) knocked off the Timberwolves (2-4) 102-92 in Miami on Saturday night, ending a two-game losing skid. Playing without Ricky Rubio, who rolled his ankle in Friday’s overtime loss to Orlando, Minnesota turned to rookie Zach LeVine fill in at point guard.

The Wolves struggled from the field (40.2 percent) and were led by 19 points and 11 rebounds from Nikola Pekovic. Thaddeus Young added 16 points and six rebounds, while Shabazz Muhammad added 13 points off the bench in 11 minutes. Gorgui Dieng pitched in 12 points and six rebounds. The Timberwolves out-rebounded Miami 17-6 on the offensive glass but recorded just 13 assists on 35 field goals, compared to Miami’s 26 (41 field goal attempts).Chris Bosh continued his strong play for the Heat, scoring 24 points to go with seven rebounds in 35 minutes. Dwyane Wade added 25 points (11-16 FG) of his own, as well as eight assists and a pair of steals. Norris Cole, who continues to start over Mario Chalmers, had 11 points and six assists.Miami jumped out to an early 29-13 lead and maintained a 12-point advantage at halftime. However, Minnesota would storm back late, going on a 6-0 run in the middle of the fourth quarter to slice the deficit to just four with 3:55 remaining. The Wolves would only get one field goal the rest of the way, though, as Bosh and Wade scored the final 10 Miami points to seal the victory.The Timberwolves move on to face the Rockets in a nationally televised game Wednesday.

While Rose’s replacement, Kirk Hinrich, was held scoreless in 28 minutes, Aaron Brooks picked up the slack with 26 points (9-15 FG) off the bench. Pau Gasol chipped in 19 points and nine assists, while Joakim Noah added 13 points, 11 rebounds and six assists.

Kelly Olynyk added 18 points and 11 rebounds, while Jeff Green chipped in 14 points. Chicago, which had previously lost only to Cleveland, jumped out to a five-point first quarter advantage but were unable to stop Boston in the second, as the Celtics used a late 7-0 run to go into halftime with a 15-point lead. That lead was upped to 16 by the end of the third, but Chicago would make a run in the final period. Down 13 with 4:18 remaining, Brooks spurred a 12-2 run to slice the lead to just three with one minute to play. After Olynyk missed the first of two free throws, Brooks hit another jumper to pull Chicago within two. However, Boston would shut the door on the comeback, going 7-of-8 at the line in the final minute to ice the game.Up next, the Celtics host the Thunder on Wednesday night. Chicago remains home to host the Pistons on Monday.

												The Charlotte Hornets (3-3) hit a buzzer-beating three pointer to knock off the Atlanta Hawks (1-3) 122-119 in double overtime on Friday night.It took two full overtimes before we had a winner, but the Hornets walked away with another home win, their third of the 2014 season. If not for a deep three-pointer at the buzzer from offseason acquisition, Lance Stephenson, these two would have played a third overtime. The Hornets got big games from a few key players, including big man Al Jefferson, who had 34 points (15-24 FG, 4-8 FT) with nine rebounds and three assists. Kemba Walker fell just short of a triple-double with 15 points (6-16 FG, 0-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT), with 10 assists and nine rebounds. The Hornets had four other players score in double figures, including Gary Neal, who scored 23 points (6-11 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 8-9 FT) off of the bench.The Hawks had to feel drained after losing this game, as they had the ball with just over two seconds left in the second overtime, but a moving screen was called on Kyle Korver. Atlanta got double digits from each of their starters, including double-double's from Jeff Teague with 22 points (9-23 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 3-4 FT) and 15 assists, and Al Horford with 24 points (11-16 FG, 2-3 FT) and 10 rebounds.

												The Magic (2-4) knocked off the Timberwolves (2-3) 112-103 in overtime at the Amway Center on Friday night.In what was a great game to watch, the Timberwolves just couldn't steal one on the road. They were led by Kevin Martin's 21 points (7-20 FG, 3-11 3Pt, 4-4 FT), and NIkola Pekovic's 16 points (6-13 FG, 4-5 FT). While it was really an all-around effort from the Timberwolves, who saw 12 players score in this game, including 16 points (6-11 FG, 4-6 FT) from reserve Corey Brewer, they did get some bad news. Minnesota lost Ricky Rubio to an ankle injury, which they're awaiting MRI results on. The Timberwolves will head to Miami and take on the Heat on Saturday.The Magic put up 18 points in overtime to walk away with their second win of the season, and saw a total of six players score in double-digits. They were led by 20 points (8-15 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 2-3 FT) from Evan Fournier, as well as a huge double-double from Tobias Harris, who scored 17 points (7-15 FG, 1-2 3 Pt, 2-4 FT), with 16 rebounds. While the starters played heavy minutes, Aaron Gordon chipped in 17 points (6-9 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 3-3 FT) with six rebounds off of the bench. The Magic will get a day off before playing against the Nets in Brooklyn on Sunday.

												The Bulls (5-1) extended their winning streak to four games with Friday’s 118-116 win over the 76ers (0-6). Playing without Derrick Rose (ankles), Jimmy Butler led the way for Chicago. The Marquette product had 15 points in the first half, finishing with 23 to go with seven rebounds and five assists. It was Mike Dunleavy, however, who led in scoring, pouring in 27 points on 9-of-15 shooting, including 5-of-8 from three-point range. Kirk Heinrich added 13 points and seven assists, while Taj Gibson chipped in 11 points off the bench. Pau Gasol had a 17-point, 12-rebound double-double. Philadelphia, which shot over 47 percent from the field, trailed by 16 entering the final period. Chicago maintained the lead throughout the fourth but the Sixers would mount a furious comeback late. Down nine with 36 seconds remaining, Philadelphia got hot from beyond the arc, as Chris Johnson and Hollis Thompson combined to hit three consecutive three-pointers, cutting the Chicago lead to just one with five seconds to play. Kirk Hinrich hit a pair of free throws to extend it to three with two seconds remaining, and a K.J. McDaniels heave at the buzzer fell well short of the rim.The Sixers, whose last two losses have come by a combined five points, were paced by another strong performance by Tony Wroten. Filling in as the starting point guard for Michael Carter-Williams (shoulder), Wroten finished with 31 points but shot just 11-of-27 from the field. Thompson chipped in 21 points, while Henry Sims added 16 and eight rebounds. Nerlens Noel did not play after injuring his ankle against Orlando on Wednesday. Up next, the Sixers head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Sunday evening. Chicago, meanwhile, travels back home to host the Celtics on Saturday.

												The Bucks (2-4) got 18 points from rookie Jabari Parker, but it wasn’t enough to hold off the Pistons in Detroit on Friday.Milwaukee fell 98-95 for its second consecutive defeat after losing to the Bulls on Wednesday. The Bucks, who shot 46.6 percent from the floor and 25 percent (5-of-20) from three, trailed by four entering the fourth quarter but were never able to completely erase the lead. A Parker steal and dunk trimmed the deficit to two with 1:28 to play, but Greg Monroe responded with a basket on the other end. Then, following a Brandon Knight layup, Josh Smith rebounded a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope airball and laid it in, pushing the lead back to four. Caron Butler would go on to close the game out at the free throw line.For the second straight game, the Bucks got production from a number of sources, as 10 players saw double-digit minutes. Leading scorer Brandon Knight had 17 points, nine assists and six rebounds, joining Parker as the only Bucks in double-figures. Larry Sanders had seven points and five rebounds in 25 minutes, while Kendall Marshall, who entered the starting lineup in place of Jared Dudley, added three points and four assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo contributed nine points off the bench, as did Dudley.Detroit had six players in double-figures, led by 19 points from Caldwell-Pope. Brandon Jennings added 15 points, including four three-pointers, and Andre Drummond had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Josh Smith continued to struggle from the floor, shooting 5-of-14 (4-10 FT) en route to 14 points. Milwaukee, which out-rebounded Chicago by eight on Wednesday, grabbed 35 rebounds, compared to Detroit’s 40. Looking ahead, the Bucks return home to host the Grizzlies on Saturday. Detroit hosts the Jazz on Sunday evening.

												The Pacers (1-4) dropped their fourth straight game, falling to the Celtics 101-98 in Boston on Friday night.Still without David West (ankle) and George Hill (knee) - and, of course, Paul George (leg) - the Pacers started a backcourt of Donald Sloan and Chris Copeland to go with Solomon Hill, Luis Scola and Roy Hibbert. All five starters scored in double-figures, with Hibbert’s 22-point, 11-rebound double-double leading the way. Copeland added 17 points and six rebounds, and Scola chipped in 11 points and eight boards. Lavoy Allen had 12 points off the bench. Boston got a team-high 17 points from Jared Sullenger, who also pulled down six rebounds. Jeff Green contributed 15 points and seven rebounds, while Avery Bradley added 11 points. It was an off-night for Rajon Rondo, who scored a quiet eight points (4-10 FG) to go with six assists, his lowest total of the season. Rookie Marcus Smart also struggled, scoring three points on just 1-of-6 shooting in 16 minutes.The Celtics, who led by two entering the fourth, were able to hold off a late Pacers run, as a five point lead evaporated in the final minute. Two Sloan free throws cut the lead to one with three seconds remaining, but Bradley knocked down a pair on the other end to put Boston back up by three. On the ensuing possession, Indiana was unable to get off a last-second heave.Next up, the Celtics travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Saturday. Indiana head back home to host the Wizards on Saturday night.

												The Brooklyn Nets were too much to handle for the New York Knicks in a 110-99 win at the Barclays Center on Friday.Coach Derek Fisher decided to go with an unusual starting lineup without a prototypical point guard, which presumably is not needed in the triangle offense. Iman Shumpert and Tim Hardaway Jr. got the start instead of normal starter Shane Larkin, who was regulated to a bench role tonight. The strategy did not pay off as the Knicks got burnt often at the three-point line.Brooklyn went 14-24 as a team from three-point land, connecting at a 58 percent clip. Brook Lopez looked like his awkward, yet effective self, scoring 20 points (6-10 FG, 8-10 FT) with nine rebounds, one assist, one steal, and two blocks. Deron Williams also showed his full repertoire tonight scoring a team-high 29 points (10-15 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 7-10 FT).Carmelo Anthony had a poor shooting night for the third straight game, shooting 25 percent from the field. He scored 19 points (5-20 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-9 FT) with four rebounds, four assists, and one steal while turning the ball over once.The Knicks will look to right the ship Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks while the Nets take on the Orlando Magic on Sunday.

												The Raptors (5-1) knocked off the Wizards (4-2) 103-84 at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on Friday.Wearing the iconic purple throwback uniforms from the late-90’s, Toronto jumped out to a quick first quarter lead and never looked back. The Raptors led 28-18 after one and extended the margin to 24 points by halftime. The lead held through the third quarter, as Washington was never truly able to chip away until garbage time.Toronto shot 43.8 percent from the field and just over 77 percent from the line (24-of-31).

												The Cleveland Cavaliers (2-3) took down the Denver Nuggets (1-4) on Friday night at the Pepsi Center.The past day was filled with drama and rumors about the Cleveland Cavaliers. Did Kyrie Irving and LeBron James get into a ""healthy"" discussion after last night's loss? Well, at least for a night, that's all pushed to the side, as the Cavaliers went on the road and got the job done against the Nuggets. It was a team effort for the Cavs on Friday night, as seven players scored in double digits, including a double-double from James, with 22 points (8-18 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 5-6 FT) with 11 assists. Before this game, the Cavaliers had managed just six assists as a team in each of their last two games. In this one, Irving tallied six assists by himself, and the team had 25 total assists.The Nuggets are in the midst of trying to figure out what lineup clicks, and we saw nine players get on the floor for at least 16 minutes. Randy Foye led the charge with 28 points (10-19 FG, 5-10 3Pt, 3-4 FT) with nine assists. The other solid performance for Denver came from Wilson Chandler, who posted a double-double with 14 points (5-10 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 2-2 FT) with 10 rebounds.The Cavaliers get the weekend off before taking on the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday, November 10th. The Nuggets will head to Portland to play the Trail Blazers on Sunday night.

												The Houston Rockets (6-0) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (2-2) 98-81 on Thursday.As he's done several times every season over the past few years, coach Gregg Popovich opted to rest several of his players Thursday. It was a planned day of rest for Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, and they were joined on the bench by Marco Belinelli, who injured his groin in Wednesday's game, and Tiago Splitter, who tried to return to action Wednesday but had to leave do to a flair up of his calf issue. The Spurs were resigned to starting Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Matt Bonner, and Aron Baynes against Dwight Howard and James Harden.Howard had his best game of the season, posting 32 points and 16 rebounds in 33 minutes. Harden put up 20 points to go with six rebounds, six assists, and three blocks in 33 minutes, doing himself well in what appears to be a season he'll be making a bid for both the scoring championship and the MVP Award.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (3-2) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (3-2) 108-87 at the Moda Center in Portland on Thursday.The Mavericks were up by four points at halftime, but the Trail Blazers separated from the Mavs with a huge 35-18 third quarter, and the outcome of the game never came back into question. Portland held the Mavs to 37 percent shooting from the field and 22 percent from beyond the arc, while the Trail Blazers finished shooting 52 percent from the field and 40 percent from beyond the arc. LaMarcus Aldridge finished with a game-high 20 points in 30 minutes, and the Blazers rested their starters down the stretch to give some of their bench players extended run. C.J. McCollum and Chris Kaman finished with double-digit points off the bench. McCollum had 13 points in 21 minutes, converting three three-pointers.The Mavericks will finish off a back-to-back set Friday when they play on the road against the Utah Jazz.

												The Charlotte Hornets (2-3) defeated the Miami Heat (3-2) 96-89 on Wednesday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte.Although the Heat turned the ball over only eight times in this matchup, the team collectively couldn't score the ball enough and finished the game shooting 39 percent from the field and 19 percent from beyond the arc. The Hornets went 43 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three-point line. Despite only shooting a slightly higher percentage, and committing more turnovers, it was still enough for the Hornets to get the victory and inch a game closer to the Heat in the Southeast Division. Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh led the Heat and were the only two players to score in double figures. Bosh recorded his third double-double of the year, going for 23 points and 13 rebounds, while Wade had 25 points and seven assists. Despite dealing with an arm injury, Luol Deng was able to start Wednesday, and he had nine points and two steals in 27 minutes. Norris Cole struggled to find his shot in this one, as he went 1-for-6 from the field and 0-for-2 from beyond the arc. Rookie Shabazz Napier scored seven points in 26 minutes and stayed consistent with the types of numbers he's had for the first five games of the season. With Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (chest) out for his second straight game, Gerald Henderson got the start again. Despite the start, Henderson played only 18 minutes, and finised with just four points. Al Jefferson eclipsed the 20-point mark and led the Hornets in scoring for the second straight game, finishing with 28 points and 10 rebounds. This was his first double-double since recording one in the season opener against the Bucks. Lance Stephenson's early-season struggles continued, as he shot only 3-for-12 from the field to score eight points. He was still able to contribute 13 rebounds, so it wasn't all bad for the forward. Kemba Walker found his stroke Wednesday, scoring 18 points (5-6 FG, 2-2 3Pt, 6-6 FT) with seven assists. The Hornets' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Heat will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday.

												The Orlando Magic (1-4) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-5) 91-89 on Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.This was a battle of current Eastern Conference bottom feeders, as both teams came in looking for their first victory of the 2014-15 season. In a sloppy game, both teams committed over 20 turnovers, but the Magic were able to secure the victory after out-rebounding the Sixers 51 to 38. Channing Frye posted his first double-double of the season, scoring 13 points and securing 11 rebounds. Tobias Harris continued to lead the Magic in scoring as he finished with 18 points (8-18 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and eight rebounds. He's now scored in double figures in all five games for the Magic this season. Nikola Vucevic continued to post strong offensive numbers, chipping in 17 points to go along with five rebounds. This was the first game this season he had less than 10 rebounds. Coming off the bench, Ben Gordon went 5-for-11 from the field and 5-for-6 from the free-throw line to contribute 15 points. Tony Wroten continued his strong start to the season, finishing with 27 points and eight assists. He shot 9-for-16 from the field and 4-for-6 from the three-point line, but also comitted nine turnovers. He's now eclipsed the 20-point mark in four out of five games this season. Brandon Davies had the next most points for the Sixers, as he had 20 points of his own, going 9-for-11 from the field. Coming off the bench, rookie K.J. McDaniels played 28 minutes and turned that into 12 points (5-10 FG, 1-2 3Pt) and three blocks. Uncharacteristic of a guard, he continues to provide blocks for the Sixers. Nerlens Noel had to leave after 17 minutes with a sprained left ankle and did not return. The Magic's next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday, while the Sixers will play at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday.  											",Philadelphia,76ers,Orlando,Magic,Wells Fargo Center,1,4,0,5,8.0,25.0,32.0,74.0,15.0,23.0,37.0,22.0,20.0,3.0,20.0,39.0,88.0,10.0,12.0,51.0,14.0,24.0,Luc Mbah a Moute,5.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,25,Tobias Harris,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,8.0,18.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,36,Brandon Davies,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,20.0,9.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,29,Channing Frye,11.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,12.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,36,Nerlens Noel,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,17,Nikola Vucevic,5.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,36,Hollis Thompson,9.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,34,Evan Fournier,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,27,Tony Wroten,3.0,8.0,5.0,2.0,27.0,9.0,16.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,35,Elfrid Payton,6.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,28,Henry Sims,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23,Aaron Gordon,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,7,KJ McDaniels,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,28,Luke Ridnour,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,19,Chris Johnson,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,12,Ben Gordon,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,20,Malcolm Thomas,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,Dewayne Dedmon,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,10,Alexey Shved,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,18,Maurice Harkless,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17

The Celtics out-rebounded the Raptors 55 to 24, keeping them in the game in this close one. Kyle Lowry had his best game of the season.

From that point on, the teams traded baskets until the final minute-and-a-half, when the Wolves capitalized on a couple of key Brooklyn turnovers to end the game on a 9-0 run. Nikola Pekovic converted a basket, plus the foul, with 0:48 to play that put Minnesota up 94-91. Following a Brook Lopez offensive foul, Ricky Rubio found Thaddeus Young for a basket to put Minnesota up 96-91 with less than 30 seconds to play. Joe Johnson would miss two shots on the ensuing Nets possession, and Andrew Wiggins secured the rebound for Minnesota to salt the game away.The Wolves, who shot just over 41 percent from the field, were led by 26 points and seven rebounds from Kevin Martin.

												The Pistons (1-3) earned their first win of the season, knocking off the Knicks (2-3) 98-95 Wednesday night.Detroit, which shot just 36.8 percent from the field, was led by 23 points and a season-high 18 boards from Greg Monroe, who started at power forward and played 36 minutes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 20 points, including four three-pointers, and D.J. Augustin added 12 off the bench. Josh Smith struggled mightily from the field, connecting on only 2-of-17 shot attempts, only one of which came from beyond the arc. Andre Drummond battled foul trouble throughout the game but still managed to post seven points and 13 rebounds in 29 minutes.The Knicks, who have now dropped two in a row after beating Cleveland and Charlotte, shot it well from three (45.0 percent) but relied heavily on jumpshots, attempting just 10 free throws, compared to Detroit’s 33. On a night when Carmelo Anthony shot a paltry 5-of-21 from the field, second-year guard Tim Hardaway, Jr. led the way for New York, scoring 20 points (8-15 FG, 4-7 3Pt) off the bench. Jason Smith chipped in 17 points, while Iman Shumpert added 15 (5-13 FG) to go with six boards and five assists.Detroit held a double-digit lead entering the fourth quarter, but the Knicks slowly clawed their way back with a mid-quarter run spurred by Hardaway and Amare Stoudemire. A layup from Anthony cut the lead to just five with a 1:05 to play, but Detroit was able to get to the line and hold on, despite missing five free throws in the final minute.Up next, the Pistons host the Bucks at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Friday. The Knicks return to New York to face the Nets at the Barclays center Friday.

												The Bulls (4-1) knocked off the Bucks (2-3) 95-86 at the BMO Harris Bradley Center on Wednesday night.Playing without Joakim Noah (illness), Chicago once again turned to Taj Gibson to fill the void. And for the second straight night, Gibson did not disappoint. After scoring 16 points in Tuesday’s win over Orlando, Gibson hung 23 points and 10 rebounds on the Bucks in a game-high 44 minutes. Pau Gasol added 22 points and 14 boards, and Jimmy Butler chipped in 13 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Derrick Rose, who missed Tuesday’s contest, scored just 13 points to go with seven assists and four turnovers. The Bulls shot 46.6 percent from the field and 73.3 percent (22-of-30) at the free throw line.Milwaukee, looking for its first winning streak since the 2012-13 season, led by four at halftime but came out flat in the third quarter, allowing Chicago to regain the lead entering the final period. The teams traded baskets for most of the fourth, and a Giannis Antetokounmpo dunk - his third of the quarter - brought the Bucks to within one with 5:31 remaining. The Bulls would make a run, however, capped by a Kirk Hinrich corner three-pointer with 2:15 remaining that put Chicago up 88-80. The Bucks would never get back to within six, and the Bulls were able to salt the game away at the free throw line.Antetokounmpo, affectionately known as “The Greek Freak,” led the way for Milwaukee, scoring 13 points (6-11 FG) in 27 minutes off the bench to go with eight boards. Khris Middleton added 11 points in 23 minutes, and Brandon Knight chipped in 10 points, 9 rebounds and seven assists as the only other Bucks player in double-figures. Milwaukee shot a paltry 37.1 percent from the floor and converted only 3-of-15 three-point attempts. Second overall pick Jabari Parker struggled from the floor (4-12 FG), scoring only eight points in 25 minutes. All 11 Bucks who entered the game saw at least 12 minutes of playing time.Milwaukee moves on to face the Pistons in Detroit on Friday, while the Bulls head east to take on the winless 76ers, also on Friday night.

												The Wizards (4-1) got 31 points and 10 rebounds from John Wall en route to a 96-94 overtime victory over the Pacers (1-4) on Wednesday night.The Wizards, who led for most of the game, clung to a four-point lead with less than two minutes remaining. Following a Marcin Gortat missed free throw, Donald Sloan hit a jumper in the paint to cut the Washington lead to two. After a Paul Pierce missed three on the other end, Sloan converted again to tie the game at 82 with 1:20 remaining. A pair of Pierce free throws put the Wizards back up two, but Sloan would not go down without a fight. Following a timeout, Sloan drove the lane and hit a circus layup over three Wizards defenders with six seconds remaining. Pierce would miss a long three-pointer as time expired, sending the game into overtime.The teams traded basket in the extra five minutes, but the Wizards were able to build a five-point lead with just over one minute remaining. A Chris Copeland jumper and two Sloan free throws cut the deficit to just one with 15 seconds to play. Wall knocked down 1-of-2 free throws after being intentionally fouled, leaving the Pacers with a chance to win or tie with 12 ticks on the clock. Indiana’s execution was less-than-ideal, however, with the possession ending on a Roy Hibbert 27-foot three-pointer. Chris Copeland grabbed the rebound and was able to release a desperation heave, which did not fall through the cylinder.Sloan’s big night - 31 points, six rebounds, seven assists - led the way for Indiana, which shot just 38.9 percent from the floor. Solomon Hill added 14 points and eight assists, while Chris Copeland chipped in 19 points and 12 rebounds off the bench.The Wizards shot even worse from the floor (37.4 percent) but got to the line 23 times, converting 21 of those attempts. Garrett Temple, tasked with starting in place of Bradley Beal, scored 16 points and had seven rebounds, and Marcin Gortat added 14 points to go with 10 boards. The veteran Pierce had his fair share of struggles, converting just 3-of-15 field goals.The Wizards move on to face the Raptors in Toronto on Friday. Meanwhile, Indiana heads east to Boston to take on the Celtics, also on Friday.

												The Spurs (2-1) had seven players in double-figures and got to the free throw line 38 times in Wednesday’s 94-92 win over the Hawks (1-2). San Antonio, coming off of a 94-89 loss to the Suns on Friday, jumped out to an early 27-15 first quarter lead. The Hawks would slowly claw back into the game, though, trimming the lead to six entering the fourth quarter. The Spurs opened the fourth on a quick 6-0 to vault the lead back into double-digits, but the Hawks would respond. An 8-0 run capped by a Dennis Schroder layup brought Atlanta to within two with 9:04 remaining, causing the Spurs to call a timeout. After the timeout, the teams traded buckets virtually the rest of the way. Three Manu Ginobili free throws put the Spurs up 91-90 with a minute remaining. Tim Duncan added a free throw to push the lead to two, but Jeff Teague hit a short jumper to knot the score at 92 with 13 seconds to play. Ginobili then drove to the hoop and drew a foul, knocking down both of what would end up being the game-winning free throws with three seconds on the clock.It was an all-around effort from both teams, as no player scored more than 17 points. Paul Millsap and DeMarre Carroll each had 17 for Atlanta, while Mike Scott chipped in 12 off the bench.

												The Utah Jazz (2-3) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (1-3) 102-100 on Wednesday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City. The Cavaliers haven't been able to find their flow as a team thus far, and they took their second straight loss Wednesday.The Jazz were led by the duo of Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors, who each scored 21 points on a combined 16-of-25 from the field. Favors also contributed 10 rebounds, putting togeher his second double-double of the season, while Hayward added seven assists. After going for 17 points on Monday, Enes Kanter had his second straight game with solid offensive output, as he finished this game with 18 points and five rebounds. Alec Burks was the fourth Jazz starter to reach double-digit scoring, as he had 11 points of his own. Coming off the bench, Trevor Booker led all reserves with nine points and four rebounds. The big three of LeBron James, Kyrie irving, and Kevin Love were the only Cavaliers to score in double-digits in this game. James went 8-for-18 from the field and 3-for-5 from beyond the arc for 31 points, while adding four assists as well. Irving got off a team-high 23 shots and converted on 12 of them, finishing with 34 points of his own. Despite shooting only 2-for-10 from the field and 1-for-5 from three-point land, Love scored 14 points, largely due to making it to the line 11 times and making nine of them. Shawn Marion got the start at shooting guard over Dion Waiters, but struggled to establish any consistency and finished scoreless with two rebounds. Waiters didn't do much off the bench as he had only five points, but considering he only played 13 minutes, it wasn't as bad as it looked. The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, while the Cavaliers will go on the road to Denver to play the Nuggets on Friday. 											",Utah,Jazz,Cleveland,Cavaliers,Vivint Smart Home Arena,1,3,2,3,7.0,21.0,39.0,77.0,17.0,22.0,41.0,26.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Gordon Hayward,4.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,36,LeBron James,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,31.0,8.0,18.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,42,Derrick Favors,10.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,21.0,9.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,34,Kevin Love,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,38,Enes Kanter,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,8.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,27,Anderson Varejao,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,31,Alec Burks,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,33,Shawn Marion,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23,Trey Burke,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,22,Kyrie Irving,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,34.0,12.0,23.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,44,Rodney Hood,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,13,Dion Waiters,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,Trevor Booker,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,20,Tristan Thompson,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,24,Dante Exum,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,24,Mike Miller,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21,Joe Ingles,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13,Will Cherry,,,,,,,,,,,,Rudy Gobert,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,Joe Harris,,,,,,,,,,,

Led by DeMarcus Cousins, the Kings also out-rebounded the Nuggets 40 to 32.The Kings are quickly becoming the surprise of the Western Conference.

												The Golden State Warriors (4-0) stayed undefeated with a 121-104 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers (3-2) on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. With the victory Wednesday, the Warriors will now have a coveted matchup of undefeated teams Saturday against the 5-0 Rockets. There was no slowing the Warriors down as they shot 58 percent from the field and an unheard of 60 percent from beyond the three-point line. They were able to outscore the Clippers 65-42 in the first half, allowing them to coast to a victory in the second half.David Lee returned to the court Wednesday, but was going to be used in a limited bench role, as he just came off a hamstring injury. After playing in just seven minutes of time, he aggravated the hamstring and was held out of the rest of the game. Draymond Green continued to take Lee's spot in the starting lineup and went off for a season-high 24 points (8-13 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 4-4 FT) and eight rebounds. Steph Curry led all scorers in this matchup, going for 28 points and seven assists, while shooting 9-for-18 from the field and 4-for-8 for beyond the three-point line. Klay Thompson went off for 29 points Sunday but came down to earth slightly in this one and recorded 19 points (7-13 FG, 3-4 3Pt). The Warriors went a combined 20-for-20 from the free-throw line. The Clippers received a big boost from the bench with Jamal Crawford shooting 8-for-13 from the field and 3-for-6 from the three-point line to finish with 24 points on the night. DeAndre Jordan and Chris Paul both finished with double-doubles as Paul went for 15 points and 12 assists, and Jordan scored 17 points with 13 rebounds. This production comes a game after Paul's triple-double on Monday against the Jazz. Blake Griffin didn't have as much impact as usual, as he only recorded one rebound, but he still was able to add 14 points. J.J. Redick was the only other Clipper to score in double digits, as he had 12 points in 23 minutes. The Warriors' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Saturday, while the Clippers will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday. 											",Golden State,Warriors,Los Angeles,Clippers,Chase Center,3,2,4,0,15.0,25.0,43.0,73.0,20.0,20.0,39.0,29.0,23.0,7.0,19.0,37.0,80.0,19.0,25.0,29.0,26.0,13.0,Harrison Barnes,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,27,Matt Barnes,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,20,Draymond Green,8.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,8.0,13.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,35,Blake Griffin,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,Andrew Bogut,14.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,34,DeAndre Jordan,13.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,17.0,7.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,35,Klay Thompson,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,19.0,7.0,13.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,30,JJ Redick,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,23,Stephen Curry,6.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,9.0,18.0,4.0,8.0,5.0,33,Chris Paul,2.0,12.0,4.0,0.0,15.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,31,Leandro Barbosa,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,17,Jamal Crawford,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,8.0,13.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,24,Andre Iguodala,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,20,Spencer Hawes,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,23,David Lee,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,Reggie Bullock,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12,Shaun Livingston,1.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,18,Jordan Farmar,0.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,19,Festus Ezeli,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,9,Jared Cunningham,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9

They were also outscored 27-18 in the fourth quarter, which allowed the Raptors to secure the 12-point victory.With Andre Roberson going down in Monday's game with a foot injury, the Thunder figured had to hope that would be the end of their bad luck.

Early reports have said it isn't too serious, but more should be known in the future. Serge Ibaka finished with his first double-double of the year, going for 25 points and 11 rebounds. With the mounting injuries, Lance Thomas got the start at small forward, and he went 6-for-11 from the field for 14 points and five rebounds. Nick Collison, Kendrick Perkins, and Sebastian Telfair were the only three players available to come off the bench in this, game and they combined for 22 points, but it wasn't enough to keep the Thunder in the game.The Raptors were again led by DeMar DeRozan. He scored 16 points to go along with three rebounds and is now averaging 23.7 points and 7.3 rebounds on the year. With Amir Johnson (ankle) being held out again, Patrick Patterson got the start and found his stroke, going 5-for-9 from the field and 2-for-2 from beyond the arc for 14 points and eight rebounds. Tyler Hansbrough came off the bench and got to the line 10 times, converting on eight of his attempts. He had 12 points and seven rebounds. Suffering a facial contusion, Jonas Valanciunas had to leave the game after only 12 minutes, and he finished with six points and two rebounds in the limited time. The Thunder's next game will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, while the Raptors will go on the road to Boston to play the Celtics on Wednesday.  											",Toronto,Raptors,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Scotiabank Arena,1,4,3,1,8.0,31.0,30.0,79.0,28.0,33.0,36.0,22.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,Terrence Ross,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,24,Perry Jones III,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,Patrick Patterson,8.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,14.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,35,Serge Ibaka,11.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,25.0,11.0,14.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,45,Jonas Valanciunas,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,Steven Adams,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,30,DeMar DeRozan,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,30,Lance Thomas,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,32,Kyle Lowry,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,30,Reggie Jackson,4.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,4.0,14.0,0.0,6.0,4.0,41,Chuck Hayes,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,Nick Collison,8.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,26,James Johnson,4.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21,Kendrick Perkins,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Tyler Hansbrough,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,26,Sebastian Telfair,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,27,Lou Williams,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,18,Jeremy Lamb,,,,,,,,,,,,Greivis Vasquez,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,18,Anthony Morrow,,,,,,,,,,,

He finished with 12 points, and this was his first game since the opener where he was able to score in double digits. The Magic's next game with be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, while the Bulls will travel to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks on Wednesday. 											",Chicago,Bulls,Orlando,Magic,United Center,0,4,3,1,7.0,15.0,35.0,75.0,21.0,27.0,44.0,23.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Mike Dunleavy,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,21,Tobias Harris,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,15.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,37,Taj Gibson,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,32,Channing Frye,7.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,35,Pau Gasol,13.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,16.0,7.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,40,Nikola Vucevic,13.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,9.0,22.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,40,Jimmy Butler,9.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,21.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,35,Evan Fournier,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,40,Kirk Hinrich,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,30,Elfrid Payton,6.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,31,Aaron Brooks,2.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,29,Luke Ridnour,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,16,Doug McDermott,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,11,Aaron Gordon,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,13,Tony Snell,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,Dewayne Dedmon,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7,E'Twaun Moore,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,Ben Gordon,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Nikola Mirotic,6.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,22,Willie Green,,,,,,,,,,,

												The New Orleans Pelicans (2-2) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (1-3) 100-91 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.Having six players reach double-digit scoring and out-rebounding the Hornets 47 to 34, the Pelicans were able to grab a bounce-back victory after taking a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday, and they pulled themselves to an even 2-2 on the season. With Michael Kidd-Gilchrist sitting out with a chest injury, the Hornets inserted Gerald Henderson into the starting lineup. In 31 minutes, he contributed six points and two steals. Lance Stephenson also struggled to find his offensive game Tuesday, as he shot only 1-for-6 from the field and finished with two points and seven rebounds. Despite the hype coming into the season, Stephenson has been relatively disapointing and is averaging only 6.3 points on the season. Al Jefferson reached the 20-point plateau for the second straight game. He finished with 20 points and five rebounds in 32 minutes. Coming off the bench, Gary Neal shot 9-for-15 from the field and 2-for-4 from beyond the three-point line to score 21 points, while also adding six rebounds. Kemba Walker had a relatively quiet night but still produced 11 points and three assists. Anthony Davis recorded his third double-double in four games this year, scoring 24 points and pulling in 13 rebounds. Teams have struggled to find an answer for the young forward as he's now averaging 23.8 points and 13.3 rebounds on the year. Point guard Jrue Holiday came one assist shy of his own double-double and finished with 16 points and nine assists. Other than Davis, Tyreke Evans and Omer Asik both had double-doubles. Evans contributed 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Asik had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Providing a spark off the bench, Ryan Anderson went 7-for-12 from the field and 2-for-6 from the three-point line to add 16 points to the Pelicans' total. He'll continue to be relied upon as the most reliable source of points off the bench this season. The Hornets' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will go on the road to San Antonio and play the Spurs on Saturday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers (2-2) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (1-2) 101-82 on Tuesday at the Moda Center in Portland. With their second loss of the season through three games, and with LeBron James seemingly struggling to find his groove, there are going to be a lot of worried narratives after a 19-point loss to the Trail Blazers. It has only been three games though, and as proved true when James first joined the Heat four years ago, it takes time for teams to learn how to play together, regardless of the talent available. The Trail Blazers had a strong showing from their starters Tuesday. Despite dealing with an abdominal injury, Damian Lillard led all scorers with 27 points (6-13 FG, 5-10 3Pt, 10-10 FT), and he also chipped in seven assists in 36 minutes. Wesley Matthews had the next highest point total on the Blazers as he added 21 of his own, shooting 8-for-14 from the field and 3-for-8 from the three-point line. Robin Lopez had a strong showing and scored 19 points to go along with 10 rebounds. All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge scored 16 points and had four rebounds. Despite having his lowest scoring output of the season, Aldridge is still averaging 22.8 points on the year. The Blazers' bench struggled in the victory and only produced 11 points. The Cavaliers were led by Kevin Love who went 7-for-14 from the field and 5-for-8 from beyond the arc to finish with 22 points and 10 rebounds. He has posted a double-double in all three games this season and is averaging 19 points and 13.3 rebounds. James struggled to find his shot and scored only 11 points, shooting 4-for-12 from the field and 2-for-4 from behind the three-point line.  He also had seven rebounds and seven assists. The only other Cavalier to reach double-digit points was Tristan Thompson, who came off the bench for 10 points and recorded eight rebounds in 22 minutes. Kyrie Irving also struggled with his shot, finishing 3-for-17 from the field and 1-for-5 from three-point land to score nine points.    The Trail Blazers' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday, while the Cavaliers will go on the road to Utah to play the Jazz on Wednesday.

												The Phoenix Suns (3-1) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (0-5) 112-106 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.Despite the Lakers reaching the free-throw line 41 times compared to the Suns' 29, they couldn't get the job done on defense to keep the Suns from putting the ball in the hoop. By out-scoring the Lakers 32-22 in the second quarter, the Suns were able give themselves a big enough lead to allow some wiggle room in the second half so they could seal the victory. Coming off the bench, Gerald Green took the reins for the Suns and pitched in 26 points, shooting 11-for-19 from the field and 2-for-4 from the three-point line. This was a season-high for Green even though he only got 23 minutes of playing time. Markieff Morris had his second double-double of the year. He scored 23 points for the Suns, while also grabbing a team-high 10 rebounds. Isaiah Thomas chipped in 22 points of his own off the bench, as he shot 8-for-16 from the field and 1-for-3 from behind the three-point line. He has now scored over 20 points in three of the Suns' four games this season and has given the Suns a consistent option off the bench. Goran Dragic was also able to score in double-digits, putting up 16 points with seven rebounds.Kobe Bryant led the Lakers with 39 points, and he grabbed nine rebounds. Bryant shot 37 times, converting 14 of them, while also going 3-for-7 from beyond the arc. Jordan Hill recorded his first double-double of the season, scoring 11 points and grabbing 12 rebounds as the starting center. Jeremy Lin, who's struggled to begin the season, finally found his shot and went 4-for-8 from the field and 1-for-2 from three-point land to score 18 points. Ryan Kelly (hamstring) made his season debut and finished with two points on 1-of-2 shooting. The Suns' next game will be at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday, while the Lakers will host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday. 											",Los Angeles,Lakers,Phoenix,Suns,Staples Center,3,1,0,5,6.0,16.0,35.0,88.0,30.0,41.0,49.0,16.0,12.0,6.0,18.0,41.0,91.0,24.0,31.0,52.0,28.0,13.0,Wesley Johnson,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,33,Marcus Morris Sr.,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,34,Carlos Boozer,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,28,Markieff Morris,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,23.0,9.0,18.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,31,Jordan Hill,15.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,15.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Miles Plumlee,7.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Kobe Bryant,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,39.0,14.0,37.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,44,Goran Dragic,7.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,29,Jeremy Lin,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,27,Eric Bledsoe,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,21,Ed Davis,9.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Isaiah Thomas,3.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,30,Ronnie Price,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,20,Alex Len,9.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,20,Wayne Ellington,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,21,P.J.

												The Houston Rockets (4-0) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-4) 104-93 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. This game was a matchup of the defeated versus the undefeated. The Rockets were able to keep their hold atop the Southwest Division by getting the victory and continuing their dominant start to the season, while the Sixers continued to struggle and are still looking for their first win. James Harden finished with 35 points (7-18 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 17-18 FT) and nine rebounds in 38 minutes. Trevor Ariza had the second most points, as he finished with 24 points, shooting 8-for-13 from the field and 6-for-9 from beyond the arc. He also contributed six rebounds, seven assists, and two steals. Ariza has lived up to expectations thus far in the four games the Rockets have played, as he's now averaging 15 points and 5.3 rebounds on the season. Dwight Howard also produced his third double-double of the season and finished this game with 11 points and 14 rebounds. Howard sat out Monday's practice after a knee-to-knee collision during Saturday's game against the Celtics but was able to play 36 minutes Monday, implying that the knee issue is not serious.The Sixers continued to get production from Tony Wroten who has been filling in for Michael Carter-Williams (shoulder) at the point.

												The Brooklyn Nets (2-1) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (1-3) 116-85 on Monday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Thunder struggled to keep a handle on the ball during this matchup, as they had 18 turnovers compared to the Nets' eight. The Nets also trumped the Thunder in shooting percentage, going 52 percent from the field and 48 percent from behind the three-point line, while the Thunder went only 39 percent from the field and 35 percent from beyond the arc. Already wrought with injuries, the Thunder caught even more bad news during this game. Andre Roberson, who has been starting at shooting guard with all the injuries to the team, had to leave the game with a sprained left foot. He was only able to play 11 minutes. Reggie Jackson made his regular season debut and started at point guard. He lead the team with 23 points and five assists. Jackson had seven turnovers, but after sitting out due to a sprained ankle, he's still shaking the rust off and should round into form soon. With the injury to Roberson, Sebastian Telfair played an extended 34 minutes, scoring 16 points and dishing out six assists. He'll be relied upon even further in the next few games, as Roberson will miss Tuesday's game, and the Thunder only have two healthy guards at the moment. Nearing a double-double, Serge Ibaka finished with 15 points and nine rebounds in 29 minutes. The Nets had six players finish with double-digit scoring. Brook Lopez (foot) made his season debut, scoring 18 points and collecting six rebounds in 24 minutes. Deron Williams came one assist shy of a double-double, posting 17 points and nine assists. Coming off the bench, Alan Anderson found his stroke and hit 7-of-8 from the field and 4-of-4 from behind the three-point line to finish with 18 points in only 15 minutes. Veteran Joe Johnson chipped in 13 points and six assists, shooting 5-of-10 from the field and 2-of-2 from beyond the arc.    The Thunder's next game is on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, while Nets will go on the road to Minnesota and play the Timberwolves on Wednesday. 											",Brooklyn,Nets,Oklahoma City,Thunder,Barclays Center,1,3,2,1,11.0,22.0,42.0,80.0,15.0,17.0,39.0,23.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,Joe Johnson,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,27,Perry Jones III,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,33,Kevin Garnett,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,Serge Ibaka,9.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,7.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,29,Brook Lopez,6.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,18.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,23,Steven Adams,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,29,Bojan Bogdanovic,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,26,Andre Roberson,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Deron Williams,3.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,36,Reggie Jackson,4.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,23.0,8.0,20.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,41,Mason Plumlee,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,5.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Kendrick Perkins,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,18,Jerome Jordan,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,11,Lance Thomas,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22,Jarrett Jack,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27,Nick Collison,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,19,Mirza Teletovic,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,20,Sebastian Telfair,5.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,10.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,34,Alan Anderson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,15,Jeremy Lamb,,,,,,,,,,,

												The Los Angeles Clippers (3-1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1-3) 107-101 on Monday.Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple-double of the 2014-15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14-of-21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season-low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes.Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.

												The Kings used a strong fourth quarter to pull away from the Clippers en route to a 98-92 victory at the Staples Center on Sunday.The game, which tipped off around 12:30 P.M. local time, featured a pair of division foes, as well as two of the best young big men in the league in Blake Griffin and DeMarcus Cousins.

After a 40-point effort Friday against Portland, Rudy Gay added 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists.

Redick added 12 points, including a pair of three-pointers.The Kings jumped out to an early 25-19 first quarter lead but found themselves trailing 51-45 at halftime.

												The Dallas Mavericks (2-1) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (1-1) 109-104 on Saturday.Chandler Parsons lead the way for the Mavericks, scoring a team-high 20 points in 34 minutes. Dirk Nowitzki came up big down the stretch and finished with 17 points in 30 minutes. Raymond Felton remains sidelined with a high ankle sprain and is expected to miss at least another week.Anthony Davis continues to show that he may not have any peers. He finished with 31 points and 15 rebounds in 43 minutes, and it appears the Pelicans are going to hitch their ride to the workman-like superstar this season in their bid to become a part of the playoff conversation in the stacked Western Conference. After playing just 27 minutes in the Pelicans' season opener, starting point guard Jrue Holiday played 37 minutes Saturday and finished with 24 points and six assists. The Pelicans gave all but nine of their minutes to just seven players, using a shorter rotation than what coach Monty Williams generally has used in the past. The Mavericks' next game is at home Monday against the Boston Celtics. The Pelicans' next game is on the road Monday against the Memphis Grizzlies.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (3-0) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (1-1) 71-69 on Saturday.Tayshaun Prince was given the start at small forward with Courtney Lee out due to a concussion that he suffered in Friday's game. Lee will be reevaluated before Monday's game to determine if he's past any symptoms that would exclude him from playing. Prince finished with just two points in 18 minutes. This was a gritty game between two defense-first teams, and it showed in the box score. The Grizzlies shot 36 percent from the field and 27 percent from beyond the arc.Michael Kidd-Gilchrist capitalized on the teams' shooting woes to corral 12 rebounds to go with 11 points in recording his first double-double of the season. The Hornets shot 36 percent from the field and 29 percent from beyond the arc, matching the Grizzlies' futility on offense. Bismack Biyombo was once again left on the bench for the entire game, and if the Hornets aren't going to use the young athletic big man against a large frontcourt like the Grizzlies who stress getting their offense close to the rim, Biyombo may find himself tied to the bench for most of the season.The Grizzlies' next game is at home Monday against the New Orleans Pelicans. The Hornets will complete a back-to-back set on the road Sunday against the New York Knicks.

												The Washington Wizards (2-1) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (1-2) 108-97 on Saturday.Paul Pierce was ejected from Saturday's game after playing just 17 minutes. He disagreed with a clear-path foul call and argued with the referees until they levied two technical fouls against him with just seven seconds left before halftime. In Pierce's absence, second-year forward Otto Porter received 37 minutes and put up 21 points and five rebounds. John Wall recored his third straight double-double to begin the season, finishing with 19 points and 10 assists in 38 minutes.After two stellar games to begin the season, backup shooting guard O.J. Mayo came down to earth Saturday, finishing with just three points in 19 minutes. Fellow backup guard Jerryd Bayless was there to pickup the slack. Bayless finished with 20 points and two steals in 21 minutes off the bench. Rookie Jabari Parker recorded his second straight double-double, and it appears that lining up as the team's power forward will allow him to do a lot of board work this season.The Bucks have two days off before continuing their road trip against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks (1-1) defeated the Indiana Pacers (1-2) 102-92 on Saturday.Jeff Teague scored a game-high 25 points in 33 minutes. Teauge did a lot of his work at the free-throw line, connecting on all 10 of his attempts there. DeMarre Carroll narrowly missed a double-double, finishing with 11 points and nine rebounds in 34 minutes. The Hawks shot 51 percent from the field, getting off any shots they wanted against a Pacers team that is thinned out by injuries.Second-year forward Solomon Hill showed off his contributions in the box score a little more than usual, putting up 10 points, five rebounds, six assists, and two three-pointers in 34 minutes as the starting small forward. Chris Copeland scored a team-high 21 points in 34 minutes off the bench. As a team, the Pacers shot just 38 percent from the field, a dubiously low shooting percentage that seldoms come accompanied with a win. David West (ankle) may be close to returning, but C.J. Watson (foot) is expected to miss at least another week, while George Hill (knee) will likely be out closer to three more weeks.The Pacers' next game is at home Tuesday against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Hawks have three days off before they go on the road to face the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets (1-1) defeated the Detroit Pistons (0-3) 102-90 on Saturday.Kevin Garnett must have known it was Daylight Savings Time, because he turned back the clock himself Saturday, putting up 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes. The Pistons sagged off of Garnett all night, and he made them pay with a barrage of mid-range jumpers. Joe Johnson didn't want to let Garnett get all the glory. Johnson abused the Pistons both inside the paint and beyond the arc, scoring a game-high 34 points to go with eight rebounds in 39 minutes. New coach Lionel Hollins is letting his verterans play this season, an idea that seemed out of the question for ex-coach Jason Kidd last season. Mirza Teletovic continues to be a great source of long-range shooting and rebounding off the bench for the Nets. He finished with 12 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes.Andre Drummond was confined to 22 minutes due to foul trouble, but the return of Greg Monroe to the active lineup helped soften the blow of Drummond spending much of the game on the bench. Monroe was suspended for the first two games of the season, but in his regular season debut Saturday, he put up a double-double of 18 points and 11 rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Josh Smith each played over 40 minutes but had shooting woes throughout the game. Smith finished 2-of-8 from the free-throw line, while Caldwell-Pope missed all six of his heaves from beyond the arc. Brandon Jennings, who lost significant minutes to backup D.J. Augustin in the Pistons' first two games, was a revelation in the first half of the game and finished with 18 points and nine assists in 36 minutes. The Nets' next game is at home Monday against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Pistons have three days off before hosting the New York Knicks on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets (3-0) defeated the Boston Celtics (1-1) 104-90 on Saturday.Terrence Jones bounced back nicely from a subpar performance in the Rockets' last game.

Patrick Beverley sat out the game with a hamstring injury, and sophomore guard Isaiah Canaan filled in as the starting point guard, finishing with nine points and three three-pointers in 35 minutes.Jeff Green scored a team-high 17 points, and Rajon Rondo pulled down 10 rebounds, but the Celtics couldn't find the hoop Saturday and shot just 38 percent from the field, including only four percent from beyond the arc. The Celtics's next game is on the road Monday against the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Chicago Bulls (2-1) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (1-2) 106-105 on Saturday.Derrick Rose sat out the game as a precaution. He sprained his ankle in Friday's loss to the Cavaliers. Rose was originally listed in the starting lineup before being removed just before tip-off. He said he could have played if the game was a must-win but that it's more important to make sure he doesn't injure himself further at this time of the season. Kirk Hinrich started at point guard in Rose's absence, and Jimmy Butler, who had missed the first two games of the season with a thumb injury, returned to the lineup and started at shooting guard. Butler finished with 24 points in 38 minutes, shooting 11-of-15 at the free-throw line. Rookie Nikola Mirotic posted 12 points and eight rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench.Thaddeus Young suffered a scary neck injury and had to leave after playing just 17 minutes. He was diagnosed with a neck strain and never returned to the game. Anthony Bennett started the second half at power forward in Young's absence. Kevin Martin moved into the starting lineup for the Timberwolves on Saturday. He finished with 33 points and seven rebounds in 36 minutes. Corey Brewer moved to the bench so that Andrew Wiggins could remain in the starting lineup at small forward. Brewer played just 17 minutes. Ricky Rubio tied his career-high mark with 17 assists, celebrating the four-year, $55 million contract extension he signed with the Timberwolves on Friday.The Bulls have two days off before hosting the Orlando Magic on Tuesday. The Timberwolves have three days off before going on the road to face the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder (1-2) defeated the Denver Nuggets (1-1) 102-91 on Saturday.Russell Westbrook underwent surgery to repair his broken right hand Saturday and will be reevaluated in four weeks to set a more firm timetable. With several other players sidelined with injuries as well, the Thunder had just eight healthy bodies to use and were still able to come away with a win. Lone healthy point guard Sebastian Telfair played 39 minutes and put up four points, nine assists, and four steals. Perry Jones has become the team's defacto go-to scorer of late, and he finished with 23 points in 41 minutes. The Nuggets looked to a menagerie of players for an answer to beat the debilatated Thunder after going into the half down 55-33. They used 12 players in total but were unable to find the right configuration of players Saturday to contest for a win. Ty Lawson bounced back from a disappointing season opener and finished with 25 points and five assists in 35 minutes.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (2-0) defeated the Indiana Pacers (1-1) 97-89 on Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.Starting shooting guard Courtney Lee was forced to leave the game after he was kneed in the back of his head while on the ground during a scrum under the hoop. Lee suffered a mild concussion and will likely have to undergo the league's concussion protocol testing, which could lead to him missing some games going forward. Tayshaun Prince, who didn't get off the bench in the Grizzlies' first game, started the second half in Lee's place. The Pacers are trying to stay afloat despite all of the injuries they've had to start the season. George Hill (knee) is still two weeks from returning; C.J. Watson (foot) will likely be out at least another week; and David West (ankle) hasn't been cleared for practice, meaning he may miss more than the three games he was originally projected to sit out. The Pacers were considered a fringe playoff team before those three players fell prey to injuries, and if the team continues to have injury issues pile up, it'll be hard for their backups to overcome powerhouses like Memphis.    The Grizzlies' next game is on the road Saturday against the Charlotte Hornets. The Pacers' next game is on the road Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks.

												The Celeveland Cavaliers (1-1) defeated the Chicago Bulls (1-1) 114-108 in overtime Friday.LeBron James was able to get his groove back in the Cavs' second game of the season Friday after putting up a subpar performance in his homecoming game Thursday. James finished with 36 points, eight rebounds, and four steals to lead the way for the Cavs as they secured their first win of the new LeBron James era in Cleveland. Kevin Love posted a second straight double-double, finishing with 16 points and 16 rebounds, while backup big man Tristan Thompson stepped up off the bench and posted a big double-double of his own, finishing with 16 points and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes.Derrick Rose sprained his left ankle when he came down on Kyrie Irving's foot after a shot attempt. Rose stayed in the game initially but was later removed and never returned to action, instead opting to ice the injury in locker room. It is unclear how severe the injury is at this time, but in an effort to avoid further injury, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Bulls err on the side of caution and keep Rose out of action until his ankle is back at full strength. Jimmy Butler (thumb) went through shootaround Friday but was not ready to lace up his shoes and get back on the court. Kirk Hinrich started in Butler's absence, and Hinrich's late-game heroics had the game all but locked up before the Cavaliers enjoyed a favorable foul call and a bad defensive foul by second-year player Tony Snellthat allowed them to tie it up and force overtime. The Cavaliers have three days off with their next game not coming until Tuesday at the Moda Center against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Bulls will finish off a back-to-back set when they play on the road against the Timberwolves on Saturday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks (1-1) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0-2) 93-81 on Friday.Nerlens Noel recorded the first double-double of his NBA career, finishing with 14 points and 10 rebounds in 35 minutes. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute returned to action for the Sixers after being away from the team during the last week to be with teammate Joel Embiid back in the two players' home nation of Cameroon as the rookie Embiid is spending time with his family following the passing of his younger brother. Mbah a Moute came off the bench in his return, finishing with six points and three rebounds in 25 minutes. Michael Carter-Williams (shoulder) remains sidelined but has a tentative return date of Nov. 13.The Bucks started the same five players that they ran out in their season-opening loss to the Hornets.

												The Phoenix Suns (2-0) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (1-1) 94-89 on Friday.Kawhi Leonard returned to the active lineup for the Spurs after missing extended time with an eye infection. He started at small forward and played 24 minutes. With Tiago Splitter (back/calf) still sidelined, Austin Daye was given a spot start at power forward to matchup with the Suns' small-ball power forward Markieff Morris. Daye played 19 minutes and finished with six points. Matt Bonner, who started the Spurs' opener at center did not get off the bench against the Suns.Alex Len played a career-high 32 minutes and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds to record the first double-double of his NBA career. Len did his damage off the bench, while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes, a development that doesn't mean much in the course of one game, but after the Suns invested a fifth-overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len, his development is something they're going to be keen to push, and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point. Isaiah Thomas lead the Suns with a team-high 23 points off the bench.The Spurs have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks. The Suns will finish a back-to-back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz.

												The Sacramento Kings (1-1) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (1-1) 103-94 on Friday.Rudy Gay scored a game-high 40 points in 36 minutes to lead the way for the Kings. New point guard Darren Collison followed up his impressive season debut with another great performance Friday, finishing with 17 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists in 38 minutes. The signing of Ramon Sessions before the start of training camp put the depth of Collison's role in question, but if the first two games of the season are any indication, Collison should be part of the Kings' core in tune with DeMarcus Cousins and Gay.Damian Lillard rebounded well from a subpar opener and finised with 20 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge continued to show off his new three-point shot, coverting one 1-of-3 attempts from beyond the arc and finishing with 22 points in 38 minutes. Thomas Robinson has played just two minutes total this season and was not used at all in the Blazers' second game, a dubious development following the team's decision not to pickup Robinson's 2014-15 option on his contract earlier this week.The Trail Blazers' next game is at home Sunday against the Golden State Warriors. The Kings' next game is on the road Sunday against the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers (2-0) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (0-3) 118-111 on Friday.Blake Griffin scored a game-high 39 points to pace the Clippers, and proving that everyone in the NBA is shooting three-pointers these days, Griffin also connected on both of his three-point attempts. Jamal Crawford added 22 points off the bench, but the Clippers barely pulled out the win against the struggling Lakers.Kobe Bryant is doing his best to prove his doubters wrong. He finished with 21 points and seven assists in 35 minutes. Jeremy Lin had his breakout game with the Lakers after having struggled through the first two games of the season. He finished with 17 points and nine assists in 35 minutes. Jordan Hill scored a team-high 23 points, making a series of jumpers that are generally perceived to be out of his range. The Lakers showed a lot of fight in Friday's game, and where there seemed to be only despair following their first two blowout losses, the Lakers played well enough to offer some hope for their prospects this season if everything goes right and they stay healthy.The Clippers' next game is at home Sunday against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers will complete their back-to-back set on the road Saturday against the Golden State Warriors.

												The Washington Wizards (1-1) secured their first win of the season Thursday, defeating the Orlando Magic (0-2) 105-98 at the Amway Center in Orlando.Nene and DeJuan Blair returned from their one-game suspensions. Blair never got off the bench Thursday, but Nene was slotted into the starting lineup at power forward and played 34 minutes. Marcin Gortat started at center and finished the game with a double-double of 20 points and 12 rebounds, while John Wall also posted a double-double, scoring 30 points to go with 12 assists. Garrett Temple received a second straight spot start at shooting guard with Bradley Beal (wrist) sidelined. Temple scored 12 points in 34 minutes.Channing Frye made his regular season debut with the Magic after having missed the team's first game while still recovering from the MCL sprain in his knee that was suffered during training camp. Frye played 24 minutes as the starting power forward and scored two points to go with two rebounds. Kyle O'Quinn, who started at power forward in the Magic's season opener, sat out Thursday's game with a sprained ankle that he suffered in the opener. Starting center Nikola Vucevic posted his second consecutive double-double, putting up 23 points and 12 rebounds in the Magic's second loss in as many games. The Magic's next game is at home against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves (1-1) defeated the Detroit Pistons (0-2) 97-91 on Thursday at the Target Center in Minneapolis.Kevin Martin returned to the active roster after having missed the team's season opener Wednesday with a sprained ankle he had suffered in Tuesday's practice. Somewhat surprisingly, the Timberwolves opted to bring Martin off the bench in favor of starting No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins at shooting guard and Corey Brewer at small forward. Wiggins played 24 minutes and finished with eight points and four rebounds. Martin played 20 minutes off the bench and finished with 12 points and two rebounds. Mo Williams was used at shooting guard late in the game next to Ricky Rubio to get more scoring into the lineup, and it's possible that there could be a minutes battle at shooting guard for the Timberwolves for as long as Martin, Wiggins, and Williams are all on the roster together. Williams played 24 minutes off the bench and put up 13 points and four assists.The Pistons have a minutes battle in their backcourt as well. Starting point guard Brandon Jennings played just 16 minutes while backup point guard D.J. Augustin played 33 minutes off the bench and finished with 20 points and six assists. It's unclear if coach Stan Van Gundy is trying to send a message to Jennings or if the starting job will soon be handed over to Augustin, but something is amiss with the Pistons turning to Augustin for more minutes in both of their games thus far this season.

												The New York Knicks (1-1) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (0-1) 95-90 on Thursday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. LeBron James' homecoming didn't end the way he'd probably imagined, and it appears James is trying to fit into the Cavaliers' new offense as merely one of the cogs. He played 43 minutes but finished with just 17 points, which is more than 10 points off his career per-game average of 27.5 points. Kevin Love met his skeptics face-to-face, putting up a Love-like line of 19 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes. The Cavaliers used a nine-man rotation and leaned heavily on the starters in their first regular season game under new coach David Blatt. James, Love, Kyrie Irving, and Dion Waiters all played at least 38 minutes, while the minutes at center were split between starter Anderson Varejao (27) and backup center Tristan Thompson (20).After looking like a lottery-bound team following their drubbing by the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, the Knicks surprised everyone by pulling out a win over Cavaliers on Thursday. Carmelo Anthony played 34 minutes and finished with 25 points and six assists. Quincy Acy moved into the starting lineup at power forward, pushing Amar'e Stoudemire to a bench role. Acy played 22 minutes and finished with eight points and 10 rebounds. The Knicks leaned heavliy on their bench, with 10 players seeing at least 13 minutes of action Thursday. Starting center Samuel Dalembert played just six minutes and was replaced in the starting lineup in the second half by Jason Smith.The Cavaliers' next game is on the road Friday against the Chicago Bulls. The Knicks' next game is at home Sunday against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Dallas Mavericks (1-1) defeated the Utah Jazz (0-2) 120-102 on Thursday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.Enes Kanter is the starter at power forward for the Jazz, but he appears to be in a time share with backup power forward Trevor Booker. Kanter played 20 minutes, and Booker received 19 minutes. While there doesn't appear to be a position battle developing, as long as Booker is stealing a healthy dose of minutes from Kanter, the big man's production will remain somewhat limited. Derrick Favors played 35 minutes as the starting center and posted his first double-double of the season, finishing with 17 points and 11 rebounds.The Mavericks went full-Spurs and didn't play a single player over 29 minutes in the blowout win. They had a 25 point lead at halftime and didn't need much production from their starters deep into the game. J.J. Barea made his debut with the Mavericks after signing with the team earlier in the day. He played 19 minutes off the bench and finished with four points and three assists.The Jazz's next game in at home Saturday against the Phoenix Suns. The Mavericks' next game is on the road Saturday against the New Orleans Pelicans. 											",Dallas,Mavericks,Utah,Jazz,American Airlines Center,0,2,1,1,8.0,19.0,47.0,80.0,18.0,23.0,40.0,25.0,9.0,11.0,31.0,33.0,79.0,16.0,18.0,39.0,22.0,16.0,Chandler Parsons,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,29,Gordon Hayward,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,35,Dirk Nowitzki,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,9.0,13.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,23,Derrick Favors,11.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,34,Tyson Chandler,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25,Enes Kanter,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,19,Monta Ellis,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,29,Alec Burks,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,25,Jameer Nelson,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,20,Trey Burke,3.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,15.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,34,Al-Farouq Aminu,10.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,19,Trevor Booker,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,18,Devin Harris,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,24,Rodney Hood,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,16,Brandan Wright,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,14.0,6.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Rudy Gobert,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,12,J.J.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (0-2) 93-90 on Thursday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Russell Westbrook left the game in the first quarter with a broken right hand and did not return to the game. It is unclear how long Westbrook will be out with the injury, but some reports suggested he could miss a few as two weeks. With Kevin Durant already sidelined due to foot surgery for at least the first month of the season, the Thunder are in danger of digging a hole to start their season that may be too deep to crawl out of and reach the playoffs in the Western Conference. In addition to Durant, the Thunder are also dealing with injuries to Anthony Morrow, Mitch McGary, Jeremy Lamb, Grant Jerrett, and Reggie Jackson. They may only have eight healthy players for their next game if no one returns to action Saturday against the Denver Nuggets.The Clippers couldn't create much separation from Oklahoma City despite all of the injuries the Thunder are dealing with. Spencer Hawes was brought in this offseason to help shore up the Clippers' frontcourt depth by giving them a versatile shooter off the bench. It was expected Hawes might carve out a big enough role to steal some minutes from starters Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, but that wasn't the case in the opener as Hawes played just 19 minutes off the bench, while Griffin played 38 and Jordan played 35. The Clippers finish off a back-to-back set to start the season on Friday when they play Lakers.

												On opening night for both teams, the Hornets held off the Bucks 108-106 in overtime. Milwaukee got off to a hot start, shooting nearly 53 percent from the field en route to a 57-46 halftime advantage. A Brandon Knight-led run early in the third quarter pushed the lead up to 24 points, but the new-look Hornets would fight back. Charlotte outscored Milwaukee 32-15 in the final period, slowly chipping away at the lead by stifling the Bucks’ ballhandlers on the defensive end. Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton committed some key turnovers down the stretch, setting the stage for Kemba Walker’s heroics. Walker, who signed a four-year, $48 million extension Tuesday, converted a layup to bring the Hornets within two points with seven seconds to play. Then, after Middleton made 1-of-2 free throws, Walker came off a high screen and drilled a running three-pointer with less than two seconds remaining to send the game into overtime. A pair of Jabari Parker free throws gave the bucks the early overtime lead, but with the game tied at 106 with 16 seconds left, Charlotte again looked to Walker. He sized up Knight at the top of the key and connected on a tough, step-back jumper to give Charlotte a 108-106 advantage with five seconds remaining. Following a timeout, the Bucks were able to get Middleton an open look, but he misfired from the left wing as time expired.Knight led the way for Milwaukee, scoring 22 points (5-17 FG, 10-10 FT) to go with 13 assists and eight rebounds. O.J. Mayo added 17 points off the bench, and Parker chipped in eight to go with four boards. Middleton finished with 17 points and six rebounds.It was a tough Hornets debut for Lance Stephenson, who finished with just seven points on 3-of-12 shooting. However, he added eight assists and a team-high 13 boards. Walker led all scorers with 26 points, while Al Jefferson chipped in 14 to go with 10 rebounds.The Bucks now head back to Milwaukee to host the 76ers on Friday. Charlotte hosts Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies on Saturday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies (1-0) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (0-1) 105-101 Wednesday at the FedExForum in Memphis.It wasn't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year.Gasol finished the game with 32 points (12-17 FG), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals, and two blocked shots, getting a little bit of everything on the stat sheet Wednesday. Not far behind was Zach Randolph, who had 25 points (12-16 FG), 13 rebounds, an assist, and a block. Mike Conley also passed the double-digit benchmark and finished with 16 points to go along with one rebound, six assists, and a steal. The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5-for-11 from the field and 2-for-4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points.With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10-18 FG, 2-3 3PT, 4-4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Mo Williams matched Young's efficiency and added 18 points (6-9 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 4-4 FT) of his own. Williams also contributed four assists and a steal. No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins made his regular season debut but only had six points, three rebounds, an assist, and two steals, playing just 18 minutes.The Grizzlies' next game is on the road Friday against the Indiana Pacers, while the Timberwolves will take on the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in Detroit.

Rookie first-round pick Doug McDermott got a taste of his first NBA regular season action and scored 12 points (5-9 FG, 2-5 3Pt) in addition to grabbing five rebounds, two assists, and a steal in 24 minutes of action.While the Knicks forced the Bulls into 15 turnovers, they just didn't have the offensive output needed to keep them in the game. Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire were the only two players to finish in double figures with 14 and 12 apiece. Anthony also had four rebounds, three assists, and a steal. Stoudemire added eight boards, a steal, and a blocked shot. Samuel Dalembert made his Knicks regular season debut and finished with six points, four rebounds, two assists, and three blocked shots.

Smith, had five points (2-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt), three rebounds, an assist, and three steals.The Knicks' next game is against the Cavaliers on the road Thursday. The Bulls' next game will also be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
