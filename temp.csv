												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 111-104, at State Farm Arena on Wednesday evening.

The Hawks (2-2) found themselves in some dire straits early, falling behind by a 42-22 margin after one quarter. While they sliced that deficit in half during a second quarter where they thrived on both ends of the court, they still faced a double-digit halftime deficit. However, Atlanta continued to have the hot hand throughout the third quarter, posting 32 points and chipping off another three points from the Mavericks' (2-2) advantage. Their persistence culminated in a dominant final 12 minutes in which they outscored Dallas by a 31-17 margin to secure the comeback win. While neither club shot particularly well, a 10-point advantage in free-throw accuracy for the Hawks (71.0 percent-61.5 percent) was key to the home squad's success.

Wesley Matthews paced the Mavericks with 23 points, a total he supplemented with three rebounds and two assists. Luka Doncic followed with a near double-double of 21 points, nine boards, two assists, one steal and one block. Dennis Smith, Jr. contributed 16 points, seven rebounds and six assists, while DeAndre Jordan and Maxi Kleber had matching 11-point tallies, Jordan notably also hauled in 16 rebounds.

Kent Bazemore's 32 points, which he supplemented with seven assists, three rebounds and three steals, led the Hawks. Taurean Prince mustered 24 points, four rebounds and three assists. Tre Young shot 3-for-12 from the field, but a 10-for-13 showing from the charity stripe helped lead to 17 points for the rookie. He added five assists and four rebounds. DeAndre' Bembry pitched in an 11-point, 16-rebound double-double off the bench.

The Mavericks remain on the road and tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Friday night, while the Hawks remain home and face the Chicago Bulls on Saturday evening.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 102-86, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday night.

The Nets (2-2) and the Cavaliers (0-4) both entered this game with losing records, but it was clear from tip-off which team had it going tonight, and which hadn't it. Brooklyn jumped ahead with a 24-17 first-quarter lead, but the Cavaliers answered quickly with a 28-21 second quarter that evened things up 45-45 at the break. However, Brooklyn broke free in the third quarter and they never looked back after winning the third period with a huge 38-17 score. Cleveland would won the final 12 minutes by a 24-19 score, but it was too late for them. Brooklyn closed things out with ease and got back to .500, while the Cavs are still looking for their first win in their second post-LeBron era.

All of the five Brooklyn starters scored in double digits. D'Angelo Russell led the way with an 18-point, eight-assist effort, while Joe Harris chipped in with 16 points and six rebounds. Jared Dudley added 12 points, while both Caris LaVert and Jarrett Allen filled their respective stat sheets. LaVert finished with 10 points, six rebounds and four assists, while the center added 10 points, eight rebounds and three assists.

Kevin Love ended being Cleveland's best player after finishing with 14 points and 11 rebounds across 28 minutes, and Rodney Hood added 10 points. Cedi Osman had eight points with six rebounds, but the biggest contributions came off the bench: Jordan Clarkson had 14 points, while the rookie Collin Sexton finished with 14 points of his own.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the visiting Charlotte Hornets, 112-110, at United Center on Wednesday. 

Chicago was looking for their first win of the season in this competitive matchup, as it wasn't decided until the final seconds. In fact, there were 12 ties and 21 lead changes in total, as neither club led by more than 11 points. The Bulls actually scored the final four points of this game in the final 80 seconds, as that turned a two-point deficit into a two-point victory. Rebounding was the difference for Chicago, as they outrebounded Charlotte, 45-36. Transition offense was also key, with the Bulls winning the fastbreak differential, 16-4. Chicago ended up shooting 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from three-point range while holding Charlotte to just 44 percent from the field and 29 percent from long range.

The Hornets (2-3) were led by Kemba Walker, as he tallied 23 points, three rebounds and six assists. Cody Zeller totaled 14 points, six rebounds and two assists. Nicolas Batum accrued 13 points, three rebounds and four assists while Jeremy Lamb amassed 12 points, three rebounds and three assists. 

The Bulls (1-3) got another gem out of Zach LaVine, as he led the way with 32 points, four rebounds and five assists. Cameron Payne was the only other starter in double figures, as he accumulated 21 points, five rebounds and four assists. Jabari Parker was huge off the bench, providing 11 points, nine rebounds, four assists and two steals. 

These teams will have a rematch on Friday, but that will be played in Charlotte.

												The Miami Heat defeated the New York Knicks, 110-87, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday evening. 

Despite the lopsided final score in favor of the home squad, it was the Knicks (1-4) that looked like the early favorite for a blowout win. New York held a 27-16 lead after one quarter, but the Heat (2-2) quickly erased their deficit with a 31-18 advantage in the second period. Their dominance only expanded coming out of intermission, as they compiled 45 points while limiting their visitors to 20 in a decisive third period that essentially put the game away. As the final score implies, Miami won the battle on the stat sheet in the majority of categories, and they out-shot the Knicks by a 48.1 percent-36.3 percent margin.

Dewayne Dotson paced the Knicks with 20 points from the bench, a total he supplemented with 10 rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Tim Hardaway, Jr. poured in 14 points and added three rebounds and two assists. Mario Hezonja was the only other double-digit scorer with 13 points. Enes Kanter logged only 19 minutes on his way to an eight-point, five-rebound night. 

Hassan Whiteside led the Heat with a 22-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included three blocks. Josh Richardson supplied 21 points, eight rebounds, one assist and one steal. Rodney McGruder drew another start and posted 19 points, six rebounds, five assists and one steal. Goran Dragic pitched in 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Kelly Olynyk poured in 11 points, dished out six assists, hauled in three rebounds and recorded one steal.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 112-105, at Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday night.

The Raptors (5-0) are showing early in the season why they should be considered as one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference and they had no problems to dismantle a combative Timberwolves (2-3) squad that fought this game until the very end. However, the Raptors were in control early on and they never let it go: they jumped to a 26-19 lead in the first quarter and increased their lead to nine points at the break following a 31-29 second quarter. Minnesota showed some fight in the third quarter (26-26) and they won the final 12 minutes of action (29-31), but it wasn't enough. The Canadian franchise closed things out when they needed to, and remained undefeated through their first five games of the season.

Kawhi Leonard led the way for Toronto with 35 points, five rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks, while Kyle Lowry once again posted a double-double with 13 points and 10 assists, while also adding six rebounds and four steals. Serge Ibaka contributed with 15 points, while Jonas Valanciunas came close to post another double-double off the bench with 16 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes. Norman Powell added 10 points.

Jimmy Butler once again led the Timberwolves with 23 points but he also filled the stat sheet with six steals, five assists and four rebounds. Taj Gibson had 13 points with six rebounds, and Jeff Teague finished with 12 points and nine assists. Karl-Anthony Towns disappointed, though, since he only had 12 points and eight boards.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Houston Rockets, 100-89, at Toyota Center on Wednesday evening. 

The game started out with both teams trading baskets, and the Rockets holding a slight edge for most of the first quarter before settling on a 29-24 lead heading into the second. The Jazz flipped the switch in the second, where they outscored Houston by 13; 28-25, to take a 52-44 lead into halftime. The Jazz stayed strong in the third and held a 13-point lead midway through the quarter. They managed to carry a 14-point advantage into the fourth, where they did not let up. The Rockets made a push, cutting the gap to five, but the Jazz quickly reestablished their double-digit lead and cruised to an impressive win on the road. 

Donovan Mitchell had a massive night, with 38 points on 14-of-25 shooting, in 39 minutes. Rudy Gobert tallied 12 points, 13 rebounds, three blocks and two steals, while Joe Ingles added 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Jae Crowder chipped in nine points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal, in 32 minutes off the bench. The Jazz shot 44 percent from the field, including 10-of-29 from deep. 

Meanwhile, The Rockets fell again without Chris Paul, as Michael Carter-Williams finished with seven points on 3-of-7 shooting, two assists and one steal, in 20 minutes as Houston's starting point guard. Carmelo Anthony tallied 22 points on 9-of-17 shooting, along with seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block, while James Harden led the Rockets with 29 points, seven assists, five rebounds and one steal. The Rockets shot 40 percent from the field, including 11-of-40 from long range. 

The Rockets (1-3) look ahead to Friday, when they play host to the Clippers. The Jazz (2-2) take on the Pelicans in New Orleans on Saturday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the host San Antonio Spurs, 116-96, at AT&T Center on Wednesday evening. 

The Spurs started out strong at home, but the Pacers closed the first quarter on a 11-5 run to take a, 28-22, lead into the second quarter. The  Pacers kept it up in the second, as they pushed their lead to 15 midway though the quarter, and held on to take a, 34-28, lead into halftime. The Pacers had the Spurs figured out in this one, as they came out in the third quarter and continued to maintain control over the game. The Spurs could barely cut the lead to single digits before Indiana took a, 88-71, lead into the final frame. The Pacers were able to cruise to the 20-point win, as they outscored the Spurs, 28-25, in the fourth quarter, to earn their first road win of the season.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 123-108, at Fiserv Forum on Wednesday.

The hot start of the regular season from the Bucks (4-0) hit a bump in the road in Wednesday's first quarter, as Milwaukee scored just 22 points in the first 12 minutes and found itself down by 12 points to the visiting 76ers (2-3). The Bucks' struggles, however, would end there, as they would go on to score 49 points in the second quarter and took a seven-point lead into the locker room. 

They'd never let go of that lead thanks in large part to the stellar play from Giannis Antetokounmpo, who finished with a triple-double of a game-high 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists in 37 minutes. Khris Middleton added 25 points of his own on 6-of-18 shooting from the field, while starting center Brook Lopez made five three-pointers in one quarter on his way to scoring 21 points in 32 minutes. As a team, it wasn't a great shooting performance for the Bucks, who hit just 30 percent of their threes and shot 41 percent from the field overall, but they managed to make a living at the free throw line and shot a very impressive 28-of-30 from the charity strip Wednesday night. 

For the 76ers, Joel Embiid had another monster night, posting 30 points, 19 rebounds and six assists in 36 minutes, but he shot just 9-of-24 from the field. Fellow young star Ben Simmons also didn't shoot great, going just 6-of-15, but he still managed to post a triple-double of 14 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists in his return from a back injury. Overall, it was just a poor shooting night from the 76ers, as while 32.4 percent from behind the arc is a decent mark, they hit just 41.3 percent of their shots overall and 70 percent of their attempts from the free throw line en route to their second straight loss.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Phoenix Suns 131-113 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Wednesday. 

The Lakers found their first win of the season against one of the leagues youngest teams in the Suns. LeBron James quickly put behind him the free throw woes that resulted in a brutal OT loss to the Spurs earlier in the week and bounced back to lead Los Angeles (1-3) to their first win. A close first quarter that saw the Lakers end with a two point lead was overshadowed by an explosive 44 points in the second quarter. Javale McGree was at the heart of the action in that period, as he finished dunks (unlike his failed dunk in the first quarter, quickly shared on social media) and got to the free throw line in the twenty point rout to end the half. Phoenix (1-3) played from behind for the majority of the game, however, they saw a strong outing from their No. 1 overall pick DeAndre Ayton. 

LeBron James finished with 19 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and three steals, while Lance Stephenson led all scorers with 23 points on 10-of-14 shooting off the bench. All five Lakers starters finished in double figures, including Josh Hart, who started in place of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Ayton finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds on 11-of-14 shooting and Devin Booker added 23 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the loss. 

The Lakers will play the second game of a back-to-back at home against the Nuggets on Thursday, while the Suns will head to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Saturday.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, 97-92, at Golden 1 Center on Wednesday evening.

Things got interesting towards the end of the game, as Memphis was able to trim a double-digit lead down to just five by the end of regulation.  It wound up being too little and too late for the Grizzlies (2-2), though, as the team was unable to mount a full comeback by the time the clock expired.  Perhaps the bigger loss for Memphis, however, was an injury to All-Star center Marc Gasol.  The veteran big man suffered a shoulder injury that sent him to the locker room in the fourth quarter.  He did not return, and the extent of the injury remains to be determined.

Sacramento (2-3), meanwhile, saw strong production from its young players in the win.  De'Aaron Fox contributed 21 points, eight rebounds, and six assists.  Fox had one of the night's biggest highlights with an emphatic breakaway slam.  His backcourt partner, Buddy Hield, led the team with 23 points.  Sacramento also saw strong play from its young big men.  Willie Cauley-Stein scored 15 points to go with 10 rebounds, five of which came on offense.

For the Grizzlies, veteran point guard Mike Conley led the team with 27 points.  He added six rebounds and five assists.  Before exiting with his injury, Gasol had notched 10 points as well as nine rebounds and three blocks, both team highs.  The 33-year-old center entered Wednesday's game averaging 14.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game.

Next on the schedule for the Kings is a matchup with the Washington Wizards on Friday.  Memphis, meanwhile, hosts the Phoenix Suns and reigning number one pick DeAndre Ayton on Saturday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Washington Wizards 144-122 at Oracle Arena on Wednesday. 

It was the Stephen Curry show right out the gate for the Warriors after a significant night for the two time MVP. Curry passed Jamal Crawford for fifth all time on the three point field goals made list and did it by pouring in 21 points first quarter. Golden State's point guard went on to score 51 points in 32 minutes. Add Kevin Durant's 30 points on 13-of-18 shooting and the game became far too much for the Wizards to handle as the game became a blowout early in the second quarter. 

Washington (1-3) attempted to go three-for-three during the first quarter and posted a respectable 37 points, however, the Warriors 46 points in front of their home crowd proved daunting. Bradley Beal poured in 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting, but the rest of the starters were unable to match the high pace and efficiency that the Warriors (4-1) were playing at. 

Curry's finished with 51 points, three assists and four rebounds on 15-of-24 shooting and 11-of-15 from behind the arc. John Wall, Marcus Morris and Otto Porter Jr. also finished in double figures scoring to aid Beal. Golden State finished 58.2 percent from the floor, redefining lights out even for Oracle Arena's standard. 

Both teams play on Friday, as the Warriors visit Madison Square Garden to take on the New York Knicks, while the Wizards continue their west coast road trip and meet the Sacramento Kings.

The Pelicans (3-0) and The Clippers (2-2) played a back-and-forth game, but in the end the hosts came through and used a big second half to keep their undefeated streak alive. New Orleans jumped to a 27-26 lead after the first quarter, but the Clippers stormed back with a 36-32 second quarter that lifted them to a 62-59 lead at the break. However, the Pelicans didn't want to lose their undefeated record and flipped the script in the second half: a 32-22 third quarter pushed them ahead into the final 12 minutes, and they closed things out with a 25-25 fourth quarter that secured them a seven-point win while keeping their winning run alive to start the 2018-19 season.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 126-112, at Pepsi Center on Tuesday evening.

The Nuggets (4-0) had made quite the statement with a 100-98 victory over the world champion Golden State Warriors on Sunday night, but on paper, they had an even bigger defensive challenge on their hands Tuesday. The Kings (1-3) came into the contest scoring the second-highest points per game (125.7), with several of their key young pieces excelling early in the new season. However, Denver was the team that came out of the gates hot, jumping out to a 68-55 halftime lead. They didn't take their foot off the gas coming out of intermission, either, as they tacked another 11 points to their advantage with a 37-point third-quarter haul. That left them in the driver's seat for a comfortable victory, 

Marvin Bagley III led the Kings with 20 points, a total he supplemented with nine rebounds, three assists and five blocks. Justin Jackson was strong off the bench as well, posting 17 points, three rebounds, three assists and a block. Frank Mason III turned in a full line of 14 points, seven assists, five rebounds and one steal. Iman Shumpert drew a second straight start and contributed 12 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Willie Cauley-Stein and Yogi Ferrell generated matching 11-point tallies.

Jamal Murray overcame his left tibial contusion to pace the Nuggets with 19 points, four assists, one rebound and one steal. Gary Harris poured in 18 points and added five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Paul Millsap registered 15 points, five rebounds, one steal and one block. Nikola Jokic pitched in a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included six assists and one steal. Trey Lyles contributed 12 points, five rebounds, three assists and one block. Mason Plumlee, Monte Morris and Malik Beasley all posted 11-point efforts off the bench with some extra playing time due to the big second-half lead.

The Kings head back home to take on the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday evening, while the Nuggets head to Los Angeles for a showdown with the Lakers on Thursday night.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the host Boston Celtics, 93-90, at TD Garden on Monday.

After losing 14 of their previous 15 games in Boston, Orlando picked up their biggest win of the season on Monday. In fact, this was a wire-to-wire win for the Magic, as a 28-19 first quarter was too much for the Celtics to overcome. Defense was critical for Orlando, as they held Boston to just 40 percent from the field and 23 percent from three-point range while winning the turnover differential, 12-9. Ball movement was also huge for the Magic, out-assisting Boston, 28-21.

The Magic (2-2) got another spectacular performance out of Nikola Vucevic, as he tallied 24 points, 12 rebounds and three steals on 11-of-18 from the field. Jonathan Issac finished with 18 points and 12 boards. Evan Fournier provided 14 points, six rebounds and 10 assists while D.J. Augustin amassed 10 points, three rebounds and 10 assists. 

The Celtics (2-2) were led by Kyrie Irving, as he accrued 22 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two steals. Al Horford collected 15 points, six rebounds and four assists. Gordon Hayward generated 11 points, four rebounds and three assists. Jayson Tatum totaled seven points, 10 rebounds and four assists. 

Both teams return to action on Thursday, with Orlando playing host to the Portland Trail Blazers and Boston traveling to face the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 127-106, at Scotiabank Arena on Monday night.

The Raptors (4-0) didn't have many problems to stay undefeated and secure their fourth straight win of the season against a Hornets (2-2) team that was never able to match Toronto's pace and intensity. Toronto quickly raced to a nine-point lead after the first 12 minutes of action (31-22) and they didn't have problems to close things out quickly. The best sign of Toronto's dominance was the fact that they won every single quarter of the game while scoring at least 30 points in each one of them: 31-22, 31-25, 35-32 and 30-27.

Kawhi Leonard was the top scorer for the Raptors since he finished with 22 points and also added four rebounds and three assists, but Kyle Lowry also stood out with a double-double of 16 points and 14 assists. Danny Green had 16 points and Serge Ibaka came close to a double-double of his own with 15 points and eight boards. Jonas Valanciunas came off the bench to put 17 points and 10 rebounds in only 19 minutes.

Kemba Walker led the way for the Hornets with 26 points, five rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes, but it wasn't enough. Jeremy Lamb added 16 points, and Nicolas Batum chipped in with 13 of his own. Two bench players also reached the 10-point plateau: Willy Hernangomez (11 points, five boards) and Malik Monk (10 points, three assists).

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks, 124-113, at Fiserv Forum on Monday night.

The Bucks (3-0) and the Knicks (1-3) delivered an intense game in the second half, as Milwaukee looked totally in control of the game in the first half (71-52) but the Knicks flipped the script and a 35-17 third-quarter gave Milwaukee a one-point advantage heading into the final 12 minutes of action. At one point the game was tied at 100-100, but the Bucks pulled away late for good and ended winning by a relatively comfortable margin thanks to good execution on offense and an improvement on the defensive end down the stretch.

Giannis Antetokounmpo was the best player for the Bucks and once again filled the stat sheet admirably with 31 points, 15 rebounds, four assists and two blocks, but he wasn't the only Milwaukee player who stood out offensively. Khris Middleton contributed with 30 points and seven rebounds, while Eric Bledsoe chipped in with a double-double with 16 points and 13 assists. Brook Lopez added 13 points with four rebounds.

Tim Hardaway Jr. led the way for the Knicks with 24 points but he only shot 10-of-23 from the field and 3-of-9 from three-point range. Enes Kanter contributed with a double-double of 14 points and 13 rebounds, while Trey Burke had 19 points, five boards and four assists. Mario Hezonja had a strong game off the bench with 18 points, four rebounds, three assists and two blocks.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Indiana Pacers, 101-91, at Target Center on Monday evening. 

What was expected to be a hard-fought inter-conference battle played out exactly that way in the first half, with the Timberwolves (2-2) holding a slim 50-49 edge at halftime. However, the Pacers (2-2) were sharp coming out of intermission, forging a 73-72 lead heading into the final period. That's when Minnesota's defense came alive, as they stifled their visitors to the tune of 18 points while pouring in 29 on the other end of the floor. It was enough for a double-digit victory, one they secured without the services of Andrew Wiggins for most of the game. The star wing went to the locker room with a bruised quadriceps muscle in the first half and never returned to the game.

The Pacers were led by a pair of 20-point tallies from Victor Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic. Oladipo provided seven rebounds, three assists and a block as well, while Bogdanovic also brought in five boards. Myles Turner was the only other double-digit scorer with 16 points, a total he supplemented with three rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Thaddeus Young totaled nine points, six rebounds, a steal and a block, while Domantas Sabonis returned from a one-game absence due to a knee injury to lead the bench with eight points and seven rebounds.

The Timberwolves were paced by Jimmy Butler's 20 points. Karl-Anthony Towns generated a 17-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included three blocks. Taj Gibson went for 13 points, eight rebounds, one assist, two blocks and one steal. Rookie Josh Okogie's 12 points led the bench, and he added four rebounds and three steals. Derrick Rose continued the impressive start to his season with 11 points, five assists, two rebounds and one steal. Jeff Teague mustered just six points on 2-for-9 shooting but dished out 10 assists.

The Pacers remain on the road and next tangle with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night, while the Timberwolves take a trip over the border to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday evening as well.

The visiting Bulls (0-3) impressively jumped out to a 61-59 halftime lead, with some red-hot shooting from Zach LaVine helping lead the way. However, it was the Mavericks (2-1) which made a statement in the second half, keeping their new-look offense humming while buckling down on the other end of the floor to outscore the visitors by a 56-48 margin. Chicago was still markedly better shooting-wise, draining 51.3 percent of their attempts, including 56.5 percent from three-point range. However, Dallas countered with a 41-34 edge on the boards and by committing four fewer turnovers.

LaVine tallied a game-high 34 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block. Jabari Parker followed with a bench-leading 20 points and added three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Justin Holiday poured in 16 points, while Bobby Portis contributed 12 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in another start at power forward. Kris Dunn went for nine points, seven assists and four rebounds in his season debut.

Wesley Matthews' 20 points paced the Mavericks. He added four assists, two rebounds and two steals. Luka Doncic provided 19 points, six assists, three rebounds and one steal.

The first quarter started out with some back and forth action but slowed down to set the pace for the rest of the low-scoring game. The Jazz led, 22-19, after one quarter and looked solid on their home court. However, the Grizzlies started the second quarter on a 6-0 run to take the lead. They controlled the game for most of the quarter and closed strong to take a, 47-46, lead into halftime. The Grizzlies kept up their momentum in the third, as they started the quarter on with an 11-4 run, and held on to take a, 70-63, lead heading into the final frame. The Jazz were not able to get it together and trailed by ten or more for much of the fourth quarter. On the other hand, the Grizzlies earned their second straight win in impressive fashion.

The game started out close, and stayed that way until it was tied up at 62 at halftime. Both teams came out ice cold in the third quarter, where the Wizards outscored the Trail Blazers by one, to take a, 78-77, lead into the final frame. The close contest continued right down to the wire, where after a series of lead changes and ties, it stood tied at 108, with 19 seconds remaining. Things began to get crazy as the Blazers drained a three to go up 111-108, only to have the Wizards answer with a three of their own, sending the game to overtime, tied at 111. Insanity ensued in overtime, as the teams once again matched shot, for shot, until the Wizards hit a three to lead 125-121, with 11 seconds left. The Blazers still hit another three to make it a one-point game, and after two missed free throws by John Wall, had a chance for the win, but came up short. This marks the first win of the season for the Wizards and the first lost for the Trail Blazers. 

Markieff Morris led the Wizards with 28 points, nine rebounds, one steal, one assist and one block, in 25 minutes.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Phoenix Suns, 123-103, at Oracle Arena on Monday.

The Warriors (3-1), who were coming off their first loss of the season Sunday night in Denver, made light work of the visiting Suns (1-2) in what was an impressive bounce-back effort. Golden State led with from wire-to-wire, and the team was once again led by Steph Curry, who continues to be on fire from behind the arc to start the regular season. Curry finished with a game-high 29 points (8-11 FG, 6-13 3Pt) to go along with eight assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes. Kevin Durant was close behind with 22 points on 9-of-17 shooting in just 26 minutes, while Klay Thompson struggled shooting, going just 1-of-6 from three-point range, but he still managed to finish with 16 points. 

As for the Suns, even in defeat, they still managed to get some stellar performances from their young stars. Devin Booker led the way with a team-high 28 points (11-21 FG, 3-9 3Pt), six assists, five rebounds and two steals in 38 minutes, while T.J. Warren put together an incredibly efficient performance off the bench, scoring 27 points on 12-of-17 shooting in just 24 minutes as a reserve. Rookie DeAndre Ayton posted his second double-double of the season, recording 20 points (6-11 FG) and 14 rebounds in 31 minutes. In the end, Phoenix was just unable to keep pace with the high-scoring Warriors, and that was mainly because of the team's inability to hit from behind the arc, where they shot just 9-of-33 (27.3 percent) from Monday night.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 143-142, at Staples Center in overtime on Monday evening.

San Antonio (2-1) seemingly put the nail in the coffin with just under 90 seconds remaining in regulation, as a put-back basket from LaMarcus Aldridge gave the Spurs an eight-point lead.   The Lakers (0-3), though, did what seemed impossible and launched an 8-0 run in the final 88 seconds of game time to force overtime.  The run was capped by a deep, game-tying three-pointer from superstar forward LeBron James.  Despite the momentum shift at the end of regulation, overtime saw plenty of back-and-forth.  James had a chance to help LA seal at least a second overtime at the free-throw line, but missed both shots with 11 seconds remaining in OT.  The Spurs ultimately gained the lead on a Patty Mills jumper in the final seconds of overtime.  

In addition to his clutch put-back, Aldridge scored a game-high 37 points in the tense win.  He added 10 rebounds and five assists.  His fellow All-Star, the newly-acquired DeMar DeRozan, scored 32 points and dished out a whopping 14 assists to lead the team.  Rudy Gay contributed another 16 points.

LA, meanwhile, was without starters Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo, who are currently serving suspensions for their involvement in an altercation in Saturday's game against Houston.  In their absence, James picked up the slack, scoring 32 points, grabbing eight rebounds, and matching DeRozan's game high of 14 assists.  Sophomore forward Kyle Kuzma added a whopping 37 points in the loss.  

The loss extended the Lakers' losing streak to three games.  The new-look team is still in search of its first win of the 2018-19 season.

On Wednesday, San Antonio will host the Indiana Pacers while the Lakers will travel to Phoenix to face the Suns.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 133-111, at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday evening. 

This marked the first home game of the season for the Cavaliers, who started off with two tough road losses. The Cavs came out strong in quarter one, as they led 13-7 at the mid-way point and pushed it to a 10-point, 34-24, lead heading into the second. However, the Hawks came to life in the second quarter, led by Trae Young, to outscore Cleveland, 40-26, in the frame and take a, 64-60, lead into halftime. The Hawks stayed on top through the third and held a six-point lead heading into the fourth. They kicked it to yet another gear in the fourth, where they jumped to a 17-point lead mid way through the quarter. The Cavs could not keep up and were soon down by 20, en route to their third straight loss to start the season. 

Trae Young showed out with 35 points, 11 assists, two rebounds and one steal, in the best game of his young career. Alex Len was solid in the middle, with 16 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and four blocks, while Kent Bazemore tallied 23 points, five rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block. The Hawks shot 49 percent from the field, including 22-of-47 from long range. 

Jordan Clarkson was the high-point man for Cleveland, with 19 points, on 7-of-12 shooting, in 23 minutes off the bench. Kevin Love had a solid night with 16 points, 17 rebounds, three assists and one steal, while George Hill tallied 16 points on 7-of-9 shooting. The Cavs shot 46 percent from the field, including 10-of-27 from long range. 

The Cavs (0-3) will look to bounce back as they play host to the Nets on Wednesday. The Hawks (1-2) play host to the Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 131-120, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday evening.

With their surprisingly high-powered offensive performances over the first three games, the Kings (1-2) have seemingly caught the rest of the NBA off guard. The latest team to fall victim to their high-scoring prowess was the Thunder (0-3), which failed to notch their first win of the season despite the debut of Russell Westbrook (knee). The perennial All-Star unexpectedly logged 35 minutes despite not having had the benefit of a training camp or preseason and racked up 35 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. However, Sacramento saw every member of their first unit post double-digit scoring totals and shot a blistering 54.9 percent overall, including 45.5 percent from three-point range. In contrast, the majority of OKC'S offense ran through Westbrook and Paul George, and as a team, they only mustered a 23.1 percent success rate from behind the arc.

Iman Shumpert drew the start and led the Kings with 26 points, a total he supplemented with four assists, three rebounds, three steals and two blocks. De'Aaron Fox supplied 22 points, 10 assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. Buddy Hield pitched in 17 points, five boards and two assists. Willie Cauley-Stein and Marvin Bagley III generated matching 13-point tallies from the first unit and bench, respectively. Each also brought down seven rebounds. Nemanja Bjelica totaled 12 points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals and one block.

George followed Westbrook with 29 points, six rebounds, two assists and three steals. Dennis Schroder still logged 32 minutes despite Westbrook's return and posted 14 points, eight assists, four rebounds and one steal. Hamidou Diallo registered 11 points, two assists, a rebound and two steals. Adams managed 10 points, 14 rebounds, three blocks and two steals. 

The Kings remain on the road and next tangle with the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday evening, while the Thunder try again for their first win against the Boston Celtics at home on Thursday evening.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Golden State Warriors, 100-98, at Pepsi Center on Sunday night.

Both teams came undefeated into this game but against all odds, it would be the Nuggets (3-0) who kept their streak alive thanks to a couple of magnificent plays down the stretch. The Warriors (2-1) never gave up and tried to send the game to overtime in the final seconds, but a key behind-the-back block from Juan Hernangomez sealed the win for a Denver team that kept the opposition under 100 points for the third straight game. It was a back-and-forth game from start to finish, but the Nuggets came out on top once it was all said and done.

Gary Harris was the leading scorer for the Nuggets since he finished the contest with 28 points while shooting 11-of-20 from the field and 4-of-7 from the free-throw line. Nikola Jokic once again filled the stat sheet and delivered another impressive performance, finishing with 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Miles Plumlee added 11 points off the bench. Jamal Murray struggled, however, finishing with just three points while going 0-for-9 from the field.

Stephen Curry paved the way for the Warriors with a 30-point, six-assist performance, while Kevin Durant also had a decent game since he finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, but only shot 7-of-19 from the field. Klay Thompson added 15 points, and Kevon Looney chipped in with 10 points and six boards off the bench.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Houston Rockets 115-112 at Staples Center on Sunday. 

An eventful weekend for the Rockets as back-to-back games against both Los Angeles teams resulted in a split, but the some hungover damage came on Chris Paul's end after being suspended for two games following a fight with Rajon Rondo of the Lakers on Saturday. The suspension was handed down Sunday afternoon leaving Paul out of the Rockets (1-2) lineup. 

The matchup on Sunday resulted in the Clippers getting off to a strong start by taking a 29-24 lead into the second quarter. Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallianari continued their productive scoring effort amongst the starters, where they combined for 43 points on 16-of-34 shooting. The Rockets would not go away in the second quarter, where James Harden found his stroke from behind the arc and orchestrated Clint Capela into some easy layups. The momentum shifted back in Los Angeles favor for the majority of the second half, specifically the waning minutes of the third quarter where they built a nine point lead. Los Angeles had little issue in the final period until the final two minutes. After a Montrezl Harrell layup with 1:43 remaining, James Harden single handedly brought the Rockets back within one possession after a quick two point jumper, followed up by an and-1 from behind the arc. Harden missed the 22-footer at the buzzer a possession later and the Clippers escaped with their second win of the season. 

Harden led all scorers with 31 points on 11-of-26 shooting, while Eric Gordon and Clint Capela pitched in 21 points and 23 points, respectively. Carmelo Anthony still looks to adjust to his bench role and finished with nine points and six rebounds across27 minutes. Harrell was the bench leader for the Clippers and posted a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds in the win. 

Next up, the Clippers will play their first road game of the season when they visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, while the Rockets return home to face the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 132-112, at Bankers Lief Fieldhouse on Saturday evening.

The Pacers (2-1) started and finished fast, which was key to what eventually turned out to be a comfortable victory. Indiana racked up an impressive 67 first-half points, but the Nets (1-2) kept the pressure on by tallying 58 of their own. The visitors continued to hang tough in the third, but the home squad finally pulled away by posting their best point total (37) of any quarter in the final period. As the combined point total implied, both teams shot very well. The Nets drained 47.7 percent of their attempts, while the Pacers generated a 55.4 percent success rate from the field.

Joe Harris and Caris LeVert led the Nets with matching 19-point efforts. Harris added three assists, two rebounds and one block, while LeVert hauled in four boards, dished out three assists, recorded two steals and managed one block. Spencer Dinwiddie supplied 13 points, four assists, one rebound and one steal. Rodions Kurucs and D'Angelo Russell registered matching 12-point tallies, while Allen Crabbe totaled 10 points and three rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench.

Victor Oladipo paced the Pacers with 25 points and also contributed seven rebounds, three assists and four steals. Kyle O'Quinn managed 16 points, eight rebounds, one assist, two blocks and one steal. Bojan Bogdanovic poured in 15 points and brought in two rebounds, while Tyreke Evans matched Bogdanovic's scoring total and also pitched in three rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block. Myles Turner (14 points, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block), Darren Collison (13 points, three assists, two rebounds, one steal) and Thaddeus Young (10 points, two boards, two assists, two steals) rounded out the starting five's productive night.

The Nets remain on the road and next take the floor versus the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night, while the Pacers head to Minnesota and take on the Timberwolves in a Monday evening matchup.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Miami Heat, 113-112, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday night. 

It would have been difficult to envision the final score at the half, when the Hornets (2-1) held a commanding 72-52 lead. However, the Heat (1-2) refused to be embarrassed in their home opener, shaving 10 points off their deficit with a 30-point third quarter and matching that total in the fourth while holding the visitors to 21. That left them just a point short at the final buzzer, but Miami's bench generated 43 points to help spearhead the rally. Ultimately, the Heat won both the rebounding battle by a 49-40 margin and slightly out-shot Charlotte, 46.1 percent to 44.1 percent. 

Kemba Walker led the way with a game-high 39 points, a total he supplemented with seven assists and five rebounds. Malik Monk was a distant second with 15 points, one rebound, one assist and one steal. Marvin Williams generated 13 points, six boards, one assist and three blocks. Jeremy Lamb supplied 12 points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocks. Cody Zeller managed 11 points and eight rebounds. 

Dwyane Wade paced the Heat with 21 points off the bench, adding three rebounds, three assists and two blocks. Goran Dragic provided 20 points, seven assists and four rebounds. Rodney McGruder continued his productive start to the season with a 19-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two steals and one block. Derrick Jones, Jr. and Bam Adebayo -- the latter another key bench performer -- mustered matching 12-point tallies. Hassan Whiteside contributed an 11-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included two blocks.

The Hornets remain on the road and head north of the border to tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Monday night, while the Heat remain home and next take the court against the New York Knicks on Wednesday evening.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Washington Wizards, 117-113, at Capital One Arena on Saturday evening. 

Despite missing Kawhi Leonard (rest) the Raptors earned an impressive win in Washington. The Wizards started out well, but the Raptors overtook them late in the quarter to hold a 24-22 advantage heading into the second. The second quarter stayed close until Toronto pulled away late to amass a 10-point. However, the Wizards came right back with an 11-4 run, to cut the deficit to just three, heading into halftime. The Wizards continued their push into the third quarter, where they squeezed ahead and held a three-point lead with 5:27 to go in the quarter. The Raptors turned it around again as they closed the quarter on a 20-9 run, to take a 90-82 advantage into the final frame. The Raptors pushed their lead to 13, midway through the fourth, but the Wizards were not done yet, as they made it a two-point game with just 38 seconds left. However, a clutch shot by Fred VanVleet ensured the Raptors remain undefeated on the season, with their third straight win. 

Kyle Lowry led the Raptors with 28 points, 12 assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block, in 34 minutes. Jonas Valanciunas and Serge Ibaka chipped in 16 points each, as well as provided a combined16 rebounds. Fred VanVleet added 13 points, five assists and four rebounds, in 26 minutes off the bench. The Raptors shot 44 percent from the field, including 10-of-29 from long range. 

Meanwhile, Bradley Beal had a big night with 32 points, six assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block, while John Wall followed up with 25 points, six assists, four rebounds, four steals and one block. 

The Wizards (0-2) will look to bounce back as they take on the Trail Blazers in Portland on Monday. The Raptors (3-0) host the Hornets on Monday.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the New York Knicks, 103-101, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday evening.

The Celtics (2-1) looked ready to put a tough loss to the division-rival Raptors behind them early in Saturday's contest, as they punished the Knicks (1-2) to the tune of a 31-18 advantage through the first 12 minutes. However, New York turned the tables right on their visitors in the second, almost flipping that margin to head into halftime with a very manageable 50-48 deficit. They managed to claw back from the seven-point deficit they entered the final period with, getting within 101-100 with 10.1 seconds left following a Trey Burke driving dunk. However, a pair of clutch Jayson Tatum free throws proved just enough to hold off the feisty hosts.

Tatum led the way for the Celtics with 24 points, a total he supplemented with 14 rebounds and two steals. Kyrie Irving and Marcus Morris followed with matching 16-point tallies. Irving added five assists, one rebound and two steals, while Morris supplied six boards and two assists. Aron Baynes contributed 10 points and five rebounds while drawing the start for Gordon Hayward (rest), but he exited the game after logging just 12 minutes due to a hamstring injury. Terry Rozier turned 10 points of his own in 23 minutes. Al Horford mustered eight points, hauled in 10 rebounds, dished out three assists, recorded one steal and posted one block.

Tim Hardaway, Jr. paced the Knicks with 24 points and also pitched in three rebounds, three assists and one steal. Enes Kanter continued the strong start to his season with a 17-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two steals. Allonzo Trier turned in 15 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Burke was just short of a double-double with 11 points, nine assists, three rebounds and two steals. 

The Celtics head back home and await a Monday night visit from the Miami Heat, while the Knicks face off with the Bucks in Milwaukee on that same evening.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 140-136, at American Airlines Center on Saturday evening.

The tone for what would turn out to be a scoreboard-busting affair was set in the first quarter, with the two clubs combining for 83 points during the period. The Mavericks (1-1) tightened up enough on defense during the second period to erase an eight-point deficit and send the contest into intermission deadlocked at 69-69. Both teams essentially matched each other basket for basket in the third, and the Timberwolves (1-2) entered the final quarter with a slim two-point lead. However, Dallas saved their best for last, putting up a game-high 43 points in the fourth quarter. Dennis Smith, Jr. scored the final three points on free throws after Minnesota had gotten to within a point after a pair of Karl-Anthony Towns buckets from the charity stripe with 3.6 seconds left.

Towns led the way for Minnesota with 31 points and added five rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Derrick Rose followed with a bench-leading 28 points, a total he supplemented with five rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block. Jeff Teague just missed out on a double-double with 22 points, nine assists, two rebounds and one steal. Andrew Wiggins poured in 19 points and also supplied three rebounds, two assists and one steal. Taj Gibson's contributions included nine points and six boards, while first-round pick Josh Okogie pitched in six points, five boards, two assists and one steal while filling in for Jimmy Butler (rest).

Dallas' first-rounder Luka Doncic made significantly more noise, leading the Mavericks with 26 points. He also posted six rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. DeAndre Jordan posted a 22-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one assist, five blocks and two steals. Dennis Smith, Jr., Wesley Matthews and Dwight Powell turned in a trio of 19-point tallies, the latter doing so off the bench. J.J. Barea was productive off the second unit as well, pitching in a 12-point, 11-assist double-double that also included a rebound and two steals. 

The Timberwolves head back home for a Monday night showdown with the Indiana Pacers, while the Mavericks remain home and face the Chicago Bulls on that same evening.

However, the Trail Blazers (2-0) outscored the Spurs (1-1) by a 75-60 margin over the second and third quarters to gain distance, and they then held serve over the final 12 minutes to post the double-digit victory. Shooting was a key to the win, with Portland draining an impressive 53.6 percent of their attempts and San Antonio managing a 42.4 percent success rate from the field. As customary, a significant portion of the Blazers offense flowed through their backcourt, as the star duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combining for 53 points on identical 9-for-15 shooting efforts.

DeMar DeRozan paced the Spurs with 28 points, a total he supplemented with nine assists, three rebounds and two steals. Bryn Forbes was a distant second with 17 points and added three assists and two rebounds. LaMarcus Aldridge and Rudy Gay contributed matching 12-point tallies, with the veteran duo also hauling in eight and seven rebounds, respectively. Davis Bertans (11 points) and Paul Gasol (10 points) were productive off the bench. 

Lillard's 29 points led the Trail Blazers, and he also contributed nine assists and two rebounds. McCollum followed with 24 points and  a pair of assists and rebounds apiece. Jusuf Nurkic offered 12 points, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Al-Farouq Aminu went for 10 points, six rebounds, one assist and one block. Zach Collins led the bench with 11 points.

The Spurs remain on their West Coast swing and next face the Lakers on Monday night, while the Trail Blazers remain home and tangle with the Washington Wizards on Monday evening as well.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 125-115, at Staples Center on Saturday evening. 

Whether there's such a thing as an early-season ""must win"" is debatable, but the Rockets (1-1) came into Saturday's contest with a certain sense of urgency. Houston had gotten embarrassed by a 131-112 score on their home court in their regular-season opener, as the New Orleans Pelicans came in and delivered a thorough beating. The Rockets (1-1) seemed intent on avoiding a repeat despite a raucous road crowd that turned out for LeBron James' home debut. The visitors jumped out to a 66-62 halftime edge, but they couldn't shake the Lakers (0-2) in the third and entered the final period holding a slim one-point edge. However, a 10-3 run over the final 23 seconds finally sealed the hard-fought win. The Rockets' work on the boards was key, as they out-rebounded the hosts by a 54-44 margin. A pivotal development was the ejection of Rajon Rondo. Brandon Ingram and Chris Paul with just over four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter after a melee ensued following a James Harden drive to the basket.

Harden led all scorers with 36 points, a total he supplemented with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block. Paul posted a 28-point, 10-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds and a steal. Clint Capela managed a 19-point, 12-rebound double-double. Gerald Green led the second unit with 13 points and also posted two rebounds and one steal. Carmelo Anthony totaled seven points, 10 rebounds, one assist and one steal in 29 minutes off the bench. 

James paced the Lakers with 24 points and added five rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block. JaVale McGee was next with 16 points, six rebounds, two assists and five blocks. Lonzo Ball saw a boost in playing time, tallying 26 minutes and producing 14 points, six rebounds and four assists. Rondo contributed a 13-point, 10-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds and two steals. Ingram registered 12 points, four boards, one steal and one block. Josh Hart and Kyle Kuzma had matching 11-point efforts off the bench. 

The Lakers remain home and take on the San Antonio Spurs in a Monday evening showdown, while the Rockets remain in the city and retake the Staples Center floor versus the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday evening.

Nine ties and 13 lead changes show just how close this game was, as this crosstown rivalry wasn't decided until the final shot.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 108-92, at Staples Center on Friday evening.

Facing an OKC squad that was once again missing Russell Westbrook (knee), the Clippers (1-1) jumped out to a quick 27-20 lead. The Thunder (0-2) clawed back to shave five points off the deficit by halftime. They remained hot coming out of intermission and carried a 77-71 advantage heading into the final period. However, Los Angeles ambushed the visitors on both ends of the floor over the final 12 minutes, going on a decisive 37-15 run in the fourth quarter.

Raymond Felton followed with a bench-leading 12 points and also supplied four rebounds, three assists and one block. Alex Abrines poured in 10 points and supplemented them with two rebounds, one assist and one steal. Dennis Schroder scuffled while filling in for Westbrook, totaling eight points on 2-for-15 shooting while dishing out eight assists and hauling in a pair of rebounds.
