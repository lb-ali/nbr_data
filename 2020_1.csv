												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Miami Heat in overtime, 125-119, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Monday night.

The second game of the home-and-home set had the look of another rout for the visiting Heat (36-21) through the first three quarters, with Miami extending a 12-point halftime lead to 19 entering the final period. That's when the Cavaliers (16-41) came to life, going on a 13-0 run over a 3:29 span in the fourth quarter to close their gap significantly. Ultimately, the visitors needed a Kendrick Nunn basket with six seconds left to force overtime, but Cleveland finished the extra period on a 8-1 run over the final 1:20 to secure the victory.

Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo co-led the Heat with 22 points, with the latter adding 13 rebounds, nine assists, four blocks and three steals. Nunn provided 21 points, four assists, three rebounds and one steal. Jae Crowder delivered 16 points, nine boards and three assists. Duncan Robinson poured in 15 points, while Derrick Jones, Jr. totaled 10 points, seven boards, two blocks and one steal.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 129-112, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday evening.

The 76ers (36-22) and the Hawks (17-42) played a back-and-forth game, although Philadelphia had to work harder than expected to secure their 13th straight win at home. Philadelphia didn't have Ben Simmons available, but they still secured a huge win coming from behind in the final 12 minutes of action. The 76ers jumped to a 41-24 lead in the first quarter, but Atlanta came from behind -- the second quarter ended tied at 28, and the Hawks came out of nowhere to post a 40-22 third quarter. This put the Hawks up by one ahead of the final quarter, but the Sixers turned things around down the stretch. Philadelphia won the final quarter by a 38-20 score, and that led them to a 129-112 win that resulted in Philly's 13th straight win at Wells Fargo Center. The Sixers improved to 27-2 at home, while the Hawks fell to 6-25 on the road.

Joel Embiid had a stellar performance for the Sixers, as he ended with 49 points (17-24 FG), 14 rebounds, three assists and three steals, as well as one block. Tobias Harris did a good job as Philadelphia's second-best scoring option, as he finished with 25 points, six rebounds and four dimes. Josh Richardson finished with 13 points, and he also added six boards and three assists. Furkan Korkmaz contributed 15 points off the bench while also adding six rebounds.

Trae Young was the best player for the Hawks since he ended with 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. DeAndre Hunter chipped in with 22 points and seven boards. John Collins came close to chip in with a double-double since he ended with 21 points and nine rebounds. Cam Reddish had 10 points as substitute.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Washington Wizards in overtime, 137-134, at Fiserv Forum on Monday night. 

The Bucks (49-8) likely came into the contest with a healthy dose of confidence, considering they'd put up 151 points on the Wizards in a 20-point victory the first time the two teams met this season, and accomplished it without Giannis Antetokounmpo available. Milwaukee was at full strength Monday, but they had some trouble completely shaking off a determined Wizards (20-36) squad through three quarters. The visitors did hold a 13-point lead entering the extra period, but a 22-10 run by Washington over the final 5:35 of regulation forced overtime. In the extra period, the home team was within one point with 15.4 seconds remaining before Khris Middleton drained a pair of free throws and Troy Brown, Jr. missed a would-be, game-tying three-pointer with under a second remaining to send the visitors home winners.

Middleton led the Bucks with 40 points, complementing them with five rebounds, five assists and three steals. Eric Bledsoe generated a 23-point, 10-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds. Antetokounmpo posted 22 points, 14 rebounds, two assists and one block. George Hill delivered 14 points, two assists and one steal. Donte DiVincenzo turned in 12 points, 10 rebounds and two assists. Robin Lopez and Wesley Matthews supplied 11 and 10 points, respectively.

Bradley Beal surpassed the career high in scoring he'd just established in his previous game, pouring in 55 points to lead the Wizards. Shabazz Napier compiled 27 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two steals. Ish Smith furnished 13 points, seven assists, two rebounds and two steals. Rui Hachimura pitched in 12 points, four boards, two assists and one steal. Ian Mahinmi managed 10 points, five rebounds, one assist and one steal.

The Bucks next travel to face the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night, while the Wizards are home versus the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers, 127-81, at Scotiabank Arena on Sunday evening. 

The Raptors got out to a great start at home and held a 34-12 lead after one quarter. They stayed in control through the second and pushed their lead to 31, by halftime. The Pacers came out more focused in the third quarter, but they could hardly make a dent in the deficits, as they trailed by 30, heading into the final frame. The Raptors did not take any chances, as they kept their intensity up in the fourth, where they pushed their lead as high as 49, on their way to their second straight win. 

Pascal Siakam was the high-point man for Toronto with 21 points on 8-of-12 shooting. Kyle Lowry came up large with 16 points, 11 assists, seven rebounds, five steals and a block, while Serge Ibaka totaled 15 points, 15 rebounds and a block. The Raptors shot 50 percent from the field, including 17-of-44 from long range. 

Meanwhile, Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 14 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and a steal, in 31 minutes. Aaron Holiday added 14 points, six assists, four rebounds and a steal, while Justin Holiday chipped in 12 points, off the bench. The Pacers shot 33 percent from the field, including 8-of-33 from long range. 

The Pacers (33-24) will look to bounce back as they play host to the Hornets on Tuesday. The Raptors (42-15) host the Bucks on Tuesday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 128-116, at Pepsi Center on Sunday evening. 

The Nuggets (39-18) came into the contest with not only their formidable home-field edge, but a personnel advantage as well. The latter was due to the fact D'Angelo Russell was announced as out for the Timberwolves (16-39) early in the day for the purpose of resting his sore knee, but to its credit, Minnesota remained very competitive during a fast-paced first half that saw Denver take a 73-65 lead into intermission. The home squad was then able to add another two points to that margin during the third quarter, and they were never truly threatened during a final period that saw them get up by as much as 22 points.

Kelan Martin led the Timberwolves with 21 points off the bench, adding four rebounds and one block. Malik Beasley followed with 17 points, eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Jordan McLaughlin posted a 15-point, 10-assist double-double that also included four rebounds and one steal. Jarrett Culver supplied 14 points, five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Naz Reid and James Johnson provided matching 13-point, five-rebound tallies. Josh Okogie registered 10 points, four boards, three assists and one steal. 

Paul Millsap paced the Nuggets with 25 points, complementing them with seven rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Nikola Jokic turned in 24 points, seven rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. Jamal Murray compiled 19 points, six assists, one rebound and one steal. Gary Harris and Monte Morris poured in 13 points apiece, with Morris also recording six rebounds, six assists and two steals. Jerami Grant netted 12 points. 

The Timberwolves remain on the road and face the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night, while the Nuggets remain home and await the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Washington Wizards, 126-117, at United Center on Sunday night. 

The Bulls (19-38) aren't exactly known for high-powered offense this season, especially given how decimated by injury their roster currently is. However, Chicago played an ultra-efficient first half, jumping out to a 15-point advantage over the Wizards (20-35). Washington was far from done, with Bradley Beal, who scored a career-high 53 points, leading the second-half charge. After making a modest one-point dent in their deficit during the third, the visitors would get to within seven points on multiple occasions in the final period before succumbing.

Beal complemented his aforementioned scoring tally with five rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block. Davis Bertans followed with 22 points, eight boards, four assists and one steal. Rui Hachimura and Ish Smith generated matching 10-point tallies while recording eight rebounds and five assists, respectively. 

Coby White led the Bulls with 33 points, supplementing them with six boards, two assists, two steals and one block. Zach LaVine followed with 32 points, supplementing them with four rebounds, three assists, three steals and one block. Thaddeus Young delivered 25 points, six boards, two assists and three steals. Tomas Satoransky generated a 15-point, 13-assist double-double that also included three rebounds and four steals. 

The Wizards head back home to face the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night, while the Bulls remain home and tangle with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night.

Malik Monk led the Hornets with 25 points, complementing them with six rebounds and three assists. Miles Bridges followed with 22 points, eight boards, two assists and two steals. P.J. Washington followed with 17 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block. Cody Zeller finished with 16 points, eight boards, two assists, two steals and one block.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 123-118, at Smoothie King Center on Thursday evening.

The Thunder (33-22) and the Pelicans (23-32) played a very intense encounter where things were only decided in the final minutes of the contest. New Orleans jumped to a 30-29 lead in the first quarter, but Oklahoma City turned things around and jumped ahead by eight points thanks to a 37-28 second quarter. Incredibly, the Thunder managed to hold on to their lead despite winning the third quarter (35-32) and keeping tight in the final 12 minutes of action (25-25). Oklahoma City were deadly from the field and that pushed them towards a win, as they shot 50.0 percent from the field and 48.1 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, the Pelicans shot 48.8 from the field but “only” 40.0 percent from deep. With the win, Oklahoma City jumped to a 16-10 away record. The Pelicans, on the other hand, fell to 11-17 at home.

Danilo Gallinari led the Thunder offensively with 29 points, and he didn’t do much aside from scoring since he only grabbed two rebounds and collected two steals. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander chipped in with 17 points, seven assists and three rebounds. Chris Paul contributed 14 points, 12 dimes and eight rebounds. Steven Adams had a double-double of 11 points and 11 rebounds. Dennis Schroder impressed off the bench with 22 points in 29 minutes. Mike Muscala added 10 points off the bench.

Zion Williamson topped his career-high mark and finished with 32 points (11-19 FG) while also adding six rebounds and one block. Lonzo Ball registered 16 points, six rebounds and five assists. Jrue Holiday chipped in with a 14-point, 11-assist double-double, but he also racked up six boards. J.J. Redick had 24 points off the bench.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 127-105, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Wednesday night.

The Cavaliers (14-40) wasted no time in taking advantage of their opponent's vast defensive deficiencies, as they jumped out to a 33-19 lead through the first 12 minutes. The Hawks (15-41) were considerably more competitive through the middle quarters, but they still saw three more points added to their deficit over that span, which essentially sealed their fate. Cleveland enjoyed particularly big advantages in shooting and rebounding, draining 51.1 percent of their attempts while limiting Atlanta to a 42.2 percent success rate, and winning the battle of the boards, 55-38.

Trae Young paced the Hawks with a 27-point ,12-assist double-double that also included three rebounds and two steals. John Collins provided 23 points, four rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Cam Reddish poured in 16 points, complementing them with four rebounds, two assists and one steal. De'Andre Hunter registered 12 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two steals. Kevin Huerter netted 11 points.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Toronto Raptors, 101-91, at Barclays Center on Wednesday night.

The Nets (25-28) knew they'd have an uphill battle against the red-hot Raptors (40-15), which came into the contest with a 15-game winning streak. Brooklyn managed what would prove to be essential against that caliber of opponent, namely, get off to a fast start. The hosts owned a 52-40 lead by halftime, and they followed it up by falling just one basket short of Toronto's tally in the second half. The Nets' work on defense and the boards was exceptional, as they limited the visitors to 37.8 percent shooting and won the rebounding battle by a 55-42 margin.

Serge Ibaka led the way for the Raptors with 28 points, supplementing them with nine rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Fred VanVleet poured in 22 points, adding two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Pascal Siakam furnished 16 points, eight rebounds, four assists and one steal. Kyle Lowry contributed a 12-point, 12-assist, 11-rebound triple-double that also included one steal. 

Caris LeVert paced the Nets with 20 points, adding seven rebounds, four assists, four steals and one block. Joe Harris managed 19 points, six boards, two assists, one steal and one block. Spencer Dinwiddie compiled 17 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Jarrett Allen and Garrett Temple posted 10 points apiece, with Allen also pulling down 13 rebounds, dishing out three assists and recording a block.

The Raptors are back in action Friday, Feb. 21, when they'll kick off their post-All-Star-break ledger at home against the Phoenix Suns. The Nets return to action Thursday, Feb. 20, when they visit the Philadelphia 76ers.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 114-106, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Tuesday night.

The Spurs (23-31) checked into Tuesday's contest short-handed, as DeMar DeRozan (back) was sidelined for a second straight game. That didn't prevent a fast start on both ends of the floor, with San Antonio taking a 25-14 lead over the Thunder (32-22) through the first 12 minutes. Oklahoma City then bounced back over the middle periods, shaving nine points from their deficit heading into the fourth quarter. The visitors' 9-0 run over the first 3:26 of the period snuffed out any hopes of a comeback, however, even as OKC got within as close as four and six points down the stretch.

LaMarcus Aldridge and Dejounte Murray co-led the Spurs with 25 points, complementing them with 14 and nine rebounds, respectively. Patty Mills poured in 20 points. Derrick White provided 17 points, eight assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. Trey Lyles and Bryn Forbes posted eight points apiece. 

Chris Paul paced the Thunder with 31 points,, supplementing them with seven assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander delivered 17 points, five rebounds, two assists and one steal. Danilo Gallinari supplied 15 points, eight boards, three assists and one steal. Dennis Schroder totaled 14 points and three assists. Steven Adams generated a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that included two assists, four steals and one block. 

The Spurs are now off until a week from Friday, when they'll resume play after the All-Star break against the Utah Jazz. The Thunder hit the road and face the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday night.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Detroit Pistons, 87-76, at Little Caesars Arena on Monday night.

The Hornets (17-36) and the Pistons (19-37) tangled in what turned out to be a low-scoring affair, but Charlotte came out on top after a strong first quarter and never looked back. The Hornets quickly grabbed a 21-11 lead -- that was Detroit's second-lowest output in a single quarter -- and they dominated the rest of the way. The second quarter finished 26-26, and the Pistons won the third quarter by 22-19 so they still had a chance to make a comeback in the final quarter. Charlotte, however, closed the deal in the final 12 minutes with a 21-17 score and sealed the win. The Hornets won despite shooting 37.5 percent from the field and 25.0 percent from three-point range. With the win, Charlotte moved to 9-19 on the road while the Pistons fell to 11-19 at home.

Miles Bridges led the way for the Hornets with 18 points and seven rebounds, while Devonte Graham chipped in with 14 points, 11 assists and seven boards. Terry Rozier ended with 11 points and seven rebounds. Malik Monk delivered a strong performance off the bench with 17 points while adding three rebounds and three steals.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 133-92, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Sunday night.

The Clippers (37-16) came into the contest short-handed, as Kawhi Leonard sat out with a sore left knee. That hardly seemed to matter, considering Los Angeles jumped out to a 15-point lead over the Cavaliers (13-40) through the first 12 minutes that they'd extended to 23 by halftime. The game was essentially over by that point, but the visitors added another 11 points to their edge heading into a final period that was a mere formality. Besides the scoreboard, one of the Clippers' biggest advantages was in the shooting, as they drained 57.0 percent of their attempts while limiting Cleveland to a 36.8 percent success rate.

Lou Williams led the Clippers with 25 points, adding five rebounds, three assists and two steals. Paul George followed with 22 points, six boards, four assists, one steal and one block. Montrezl Harrell delivered 19 points, nine rebounds, three assists and one block. Landry Shamet supplied 11 points, four boards, three assists and one block. Marcus Morris and Amir Coffey generated matching 10-point, four-rebound efforts.

Andre Drummond made his Cavaliers debut and led the team with a 19-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included three assists, two steals and one block. Kevin Porter, Jr. furnished 17 points, four boards, three assists and one steal. Collin Sexton registered 13 points, three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Kevin Love managed 10 points, nine boards, two assists and one steal.

The Clippers remain on the road and take on the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night, while the Cavaliers remain home to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 119-118, at Scotiabank Arena on Saturday night. 

The Nets (23-28) were facing a tall order against a Raptors (39-14) squad that had rattled off 13 consecutive victories coming in, and they set themselves up for success in that regard by taking a 36-33 lead through the first 12 minutes. However, that modest advantage quickly evaporated in the second period, when Toronto built a 12-point lead going into halftime. Brooklyn then failed to make any inroads in the third quarter, but they would atone for that in the final period. The visitors' furious rally saw them knot the score at 118 on a Caris LeVert step back jumper with 35.4 seconds remaining, but after Pascal Siakam had snapped the deadlock with a free throw, LeVert misfired on a 23-foot pullup jumper with a second left to allow the hosts to escape with a win.

LeVert paced the Nets with 37 points, complementing them with four assists, three rebounds and one steal. Spencer Dinwiddie followed with a 21-point, 11-assist double-double that also included six rebounds and one steal. Taurean Prince posted 17 points, two rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. DeAndre Jordan generated a 15-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included one assist and three blocks. Joe Harris poured in 11 points and also provided seven boards and two assists.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 109-103, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday night.

A highly competitive first quarter that the Thunder (31-20) emerged from with a slim one-point lead gave way to a slightly more one-sided second period that added seven points to OKC's advantage heading into halftime. However, the Cavaliers (13-39) would erase all but three points from their deficit in the third, setting up a potential showdown over the final 12 minutes. Cleveland would manage to even take a 100-99 lead with 1:53 remaining, but Oklahoma City managed to close the game out with a 10-3 run to seal the victory. 

Collin Sexton led the Cavaliers with 23 points, complementing them with three rebounds and two assists. Kevin Love followed with 20 points, seven boards, five assists and one steal. Larry Nance, Jr. generated a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included five assists and one steal. Kevin Porter, Jr. managed 13 points, four rebounds and three assists. Darius Garland registered 12 points, six assists and two rebounds. Cedi Osman delivered 11 points, five rebounds and four assists.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 121-107, at American Airlines Center on Wednesday night.

A tightly contested first quarter belied the more lopsided nature of the rest of the contest, with the Mavericks (31-20) taking a one-point lead through the first 12 minutes. The Grizzlies (26-25) had eliminated that narrow deficit and built a three-point advantage by halftime, and they subsequently changed the dynamic of the contest altogether by outscoring Dallas, 41-22, in the third quarter. The 22-point cushion they'd built going into the final period proved to be more than enough to withstand a late-game surge by the hosts that made the final score a bit more respectable. 

Ja Morant led the Grizzlies with 21 points, complementing them with three assists and one rebound. Tyus Jones supplied 19 points, three assists and one rebound. Jaren Jackson, Jr. matched Jones' scoring and also delivered six rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Brandon Clarke compiled 18 points, six boards, three assists and one block. Dillon Brooks poured in 13 points and supplemented them with six rebounds, two assists and two steals. De'Anthony Melton managed 10 points, nine rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block.

Kristaps Porzingis paced the Mavericks with a 32-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two steals and one block. Jalen Brunson checked in with 20 points, six assists and two rebounds. Tim Hardaway, Jr. offered 14 points, six boards, one assist and one steal. Maxi Kleber provided 10 points, six rebounds and one assist.

The Grizzlies remain on the road and visit the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night, while the Mavericks travel to the Nation's Capital and take on the Washington Wizards on Friday night as well.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 119-97, at Barclays Center on Monday night.

The Nets (22-27) had to face the Suns (20-30) without Kyrie Irving but that didn't seem to matter, as the Nets cruised their way against a depleted Phoenix team and won rather easily in front of a 14,891 crowd at Barclays Center. Brooklyn quickly jumped to a 35-31 lead in the first quarter, and they would never look back afterwards. Even though the Suns won the second quarter by a 21-20 score, the Nets ran away with the game in the final two quarters -- winning 35-21 and 29-24 in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. The Nets continue to underperform and now own a 4-7 record in their last 11 games, but this was a promising performance as they moved to 14-12 at home after shooting 48.3 percent from the field and 44.1 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, the Suns shot 43.3 percent from the field and 35.3 percent from three-point range while falling to 11-13 on the road.

Caris LeVert led the way for the Nets in this game, as he finished with 29 points, seven assists, three rebounds and two steals. Spencer Dinwiddie might have shot just 4-12 from the field, but he chipped in with 14 points, four dimes and three boards. Taurean Prince had 15 points and six rebounds, while Joe Harris notched 16 points. Timothy Luwawu-Cabarrot contributed 13 points and three rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench.

DeAndre Ayton ended with 25 points, 17 rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes of action. Ricky Rubio, who was questionable due to an ankle problem, contributed eight points while logging just 19 minutes. Devin Booker had 11 points while shooting a woeful 3-15 from the field. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 21 points and five boards in 38 minutes of action.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 113-109, at Golden 1 Center on Monday night.

The Kings (19-31) appeared set to make the second half a formality with their performance over the first two quarters, as they racked up 65 points while limiting the visiting Timberwolves (15-34) to 50. However, they began to see that 15-point halftime lead evaporate during a third quarter in which Minnesota put a six-point dent in its deficit, and the T-Wolves eventually would get as close as 112-109 with 4.7 seconds remaining in the contest after a Robert Covington three-pointer. Andrew Wiggins would go on to miss a 27-foot three-point jumper with 0.5 seconds left that would essentially seal the win for Sacramento.

Shabazz Napier supplied 17 points, seven assists and three rebounds. Covington registered 15 points, eight boards, two assists, three steals and one block. Kelan Martin and Josh Okogie posted matching 12-point tallies while pulling down five and four rebounds, respectively.

Buddy Hield totaled 16 points, three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Harrison Barnes posted 14 points, seven assists and five rebounds.

The Nuggets, however, won both quarters after the second half (24-22 and 22-21) to extend the game into overtime. The Pistons were sharper during the final five minutes of action, though, and sealed the win rather comfortably.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers, 92-85, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday night.

The Knicks (14-36) came into the contest notably short-handed at point guard and facing one of the best home-floor teams in the NBA in the Pacers (31-18). However, New York established the tone with a dominant first quarter that they emerged from with a 13-point lead, and they still owned an 11-point edge at halftime. Indiana finally seemed to come to life in the third, wiping out all but one point from their deficit during the third quarter. However, after the hosts battled back to knot the score at 80 with 6:11 remaining, the Knicks finished on a 12-5 run to secure the win.

Marcus Morris led the Knicks with 28 points, complementing them with six rebounds and one steal. Julius Randle generated a 16-point, 18-rebound double-double that also included three assists and two steals. Taj Gibson turned in 10 points, seven rebounds and one assist. Damyean Dotson led the bench with eight points, while Dennis Smith, Jr. started at point guard and contributed seven points, four rebounds and two assists.

Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 25 points, supplementing them with eight rebounds and two assists. Myles Turner registered 12 points, six rebounds, one assist and one steal. Jeremy Lamb totaled nine points and two boards. Malcolm Brogdon furnished eight points, 12 assists and seven rebounds.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the visiting Charlotte Hornets, 114-90, at AT&T Center on Saturday.

While Charlotte took a 13-point lead into the half, San Antonio rode a monster second half to a blowout victory. In fact, they rode a 29-11 third quarter to recapture the lead and capped off their comeback victory with a 35-16 fourth quarter. The Spurs ended up shooting 52 percent from the field while holding the Hornets to 42 percent shooting. In addition, San Antonio out-rebounded Charlotte, 45-36, while winning the turnover battle, 16-10. Much of that can be attributed to the Spurs recording 12 steals and the Hornets having just five. 

The Hornets (16-33) were led by Miles Bridges, who tallied 25 points, six rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Cody Zeller accumulated 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. Terry Rozier generated 10 points, five rebounds and three assists while DeVonte' Graham amassed eight points, nine assists and two steals. 

The Spurs (22-26) were led by DeMar DeRozan and his 24 points, three rebounds and six assists. Dejounte Murray totaled nine points, 10 rebounds, two assists and four steals.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 115-109, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Thursday evening.

The Raptors (34-14) and the Cavaliers (13-36) played a tight game and while many expected Toronto to dominate since they entered this matchup on an eight-game winning streak, they had to work harder than expected to get past a tough-as-nails Cleveland team. It seemed Toronto would cruise their way after jumping to a five-point lead after the first quarter, but Cleveland shortened the gap at the half-time break following a 26-25 second quarter. The Raptors extended their lead after a 32-24 third quarter and many believe the game was over with 12 minutes left on the clock. Cleveland worked hard in the final minutes and won the final quarter by a 33-27 score, but that wasn't enough and the Raptors sealed the win. Toronto shot 48.8 percent from the field and moved to 17-7 on the road, while the Cavaliers fell to 6-19 at home. Cleveland shot only 36.1 percent from deep in this game.

Serge Ibaka came out of nowhere for the Raptors and led the team offensively with 26 points while shooting 10-14 from the field. Pascal Siakam added 19 points but also filled the stat sheet with five rebounds, four steals and two assists. Kyle Lowry had 23 points with five rebounds, five assists and four steals. Fred VanVleet only scored eight points, but he added seven rebounds and 12 dimes. Norman Powell contributed 16 points off the bench.

Kevin Love and Collin Sexton each led the Cavaliers with 23 points -- while Love also added five rebounds and four assists, Sexton also chipped in with four rebounds and four dimes. Tristan Thompson grabbed 12 boards, but he only scored two points. Darius Garland chipped in with 16 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Larry Nance Jr. and Kevin Porter Jr. each added 13 points off the bench.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Golden State Warriors, 115-104, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday night.

The 76ers (31-17) came into the contest as double-digit favorites, with the fact they were getting Joel Embiid (finger) back from a nine-game absence only bolstering their case. However, the presumably overmatched Warriors (10-38) were the hotter team early, ending the first quarter with a slim one-point lead and entering halftime trailing by only five points. Golden State wouldn't go away, either, shaving off a point from their deficit entering the final period. However, a 9-0 run by Philadelphia to open the fourth quarter finally gave them some separation for the hard-fought home victory.

D'Angelo Russell led the way for the Warriors with 28 points, complementing them with seven assists, five rebounds and two steals. Glenn Robinson III furnished 20 points, five boards, three assists and one steal. Marquese Chriss delivered 15 points, five rebounds and two assists. Alec Burks poured in 12 points and added six rebounds off the bench, while Draymond Green mustered nine points, 12 assists, nine rebounds, three blocks and one steal.

Embiid paced the 76ers with 24 points, supplementing them with 10 rebounds, one assist and one block. Raul Neto supplied 19 points, two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Ben Simmons registered 17 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. Tobias Harris compiled 14 points, seven boards and four assists.

Danuel House amassed 21 points, 11 rebounds and five steals while P.J. Tucker totaled nine points, 10 rebounds and five assists.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 110-107, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday night.

The Clippers (31-13) and the Mavericks (27-16) have been two of the best teams in the Western Conference this season and even though there were high expectations ahead of this matchup, these two teams didn't disappoint and delivered a contest that was only decided in the final seconds of the final quarter. The first quarter ended tied at 24, but the Clippers pulled away in the second 12 minutes of action as a 36-25 score gave them an 11-point lead heading into the half-time break. The Mavericks won the third quarter (29-22) and the fourth quarter (29-28), but it wasn't enough. Dallas had chances to even things up with a three-pointer from Tim Hardaway Jr. and two missed free throws from Luka Doncic, but they couldn't take advantage of their chances. Kawhi Leonard sealed the deal with two late attempts from the charity stripe, and the Clippers ended winning deservedly since they executed better down the stretch. With the win, Los Angeles moved to 12-9 away from home while the Mavericks fell to 13-11 at home.

Kawhi Leonard led the way for the Clippers since he ended with 36 points, 11 rebounds, three steals and two assists. Landry Shamet chipped in with 18 points while making five of eight three-point attempts, and Lou Williams added 16 points in 32 minutes off the bench despite shooting just 5-19 from the field. Montrezl Harrell had 12 points and nine rebounds coming off the bench.

Luka Doncic led the way for Dallas and he came short of a triple-double since he finished with 36 points, 10 boards and nine assists. Kristaps Porzingis had 10 points and nine rebounds despite shooting 4-17 from the field. Bojan Marjanovic had 12 points and seven boards in 16 minutes, while Tim Hardaway Jr. chipped in with 13 points.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons, 106-100, at Capital One Arena on Monday afternoon.

The Wizards (14-29) and the Pistons (16-28) kicked things off during the Martin Luther King Day's 14-game slate in the NBA with a game that remained tight throughout, and the matchup was decided in the dying minutes of the final quarter. Detroit jumped to a 35-30 lead in the first quarter, but the Wizards flipped the script with a 30-23 second-quarter score that gave them a two-point lead. The third quarter ended with a 23-23 tie, and the final 12 minutes of action saw both teams going back and forth looking to secure the win. The Wizards prevailed, however, and a 23-19 score allowed them to clinch a huge win on the road. Detroit disappeared offensively after the first half, and they paid a steep price for that. With the win, Washington moved to 9-11 at home while the Pistons fell to 8-15 on the road.

Bradley Beal led the way for the Wizards since he ended with 29 points and six assists, and Ian Mahinmi complemented him well. The big man had one of his best performances of the season as he finished with 21 points, seven rebounds, three blocks and two assists. Thomas Bryant had a productive game off the bench since he chipped in with 13 points and six rebounds in 22 minutes. No other Washington played cracked the 10-point plateau.

Derrick Rose led the Pistons as a starter, as he finished with 21 points despite shooting just 8-21 from the field.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 122-117, at State Farm Arena on Monday afternoon.

On paper, it seemed as if the Raptors (29-14) were going to cruise their way against the lowly Hawks (10-34) but that couldn't have been further from the truth. Atlanta posted a tough challenge and, with a bit more luck and a few bounces going their way, they could have pulled quite an upset here. The Raptors jumped to an early 36-25 lead and it looked as if they were going to set the tone for the rest of the afternoon, but Atlanta came out of nowhere to turn things around and grab a three-point lead at the break. Toronto steered the game their way in the third quarter with a 26-22 score, and the Raptors sealed the deal with a 39-35 score during the final 12 minutes of action. With the win, Toronto moved to 14-7 on the road while Atlanta fell to 5-16 at home.

Pascal Siakam led the way for Toronto since he finished with 18 points and six rebounds, although the team’s leading scorer was Norman Powell who exploded for 27 points off the bench. Fred VanVleet had 20 points, four rebounds, three steals and two assists, including several clutch free throws down the stretch. Marc Gasol had 14 points and five rebounds. Kyle Lowry had 10 assists and seven dimes.

Trae Young led the way for the Hawks since he had 42 points, 15 assists and six rebounds, including 18 fourth-quarter points. John Collins had 17 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish each had 13 points – Hunter added six rebounds and four assists, while Reddish added eight boards. Bruno Fernando contributed 12 points in only 16 minutes coming off the bench.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 117-111, at Barclays Center on Monday afternoon.

The 76ers (29-16) extended their winning run to four games here, a solid production considering they have been without Joel Embiid for the last few games, as they had to come from behind to get past a resilient Nets (18-24) team. Brooklyn entered this game having lost 10 of their last 12 contests, but they grabbed an early 32-29 lead in the first quarter, and they extended it with a 36-35 score in the second quarter. However, Brooklyn would see their four-point lead evaporate after the half-time break. Philly cut the deficit to one point following a 26-23 score in the third quarter, and they would complete their comeback in the final 12 minutes of action where they registered a 27-20 advantage. Aside from extending their winning run, Philly moved to 9-14 on the road with the win, while the Nets continue to crumble and are now 11-11 at home.

Ben Simmons carried Philadelphia offensively since he finished with 34 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists and five steals while shooting 12-14 from the field and 10-14 from the charity stripe. Al Horford had 19 points and six boards, while both Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson chipped in with 15 points. Furkan Korkmaz contributed off the bench with 10 points, three assists and two boards in 24 minutes.

Spencer Dinwiddie led the way for the Nets with 22 points and five rebounds, while Jarrett Allen chipped in with a 13-point, 13-rebound double-double. Taurean Prince had 12 points with 12 boards, Joe Harris contributed 12 points despite shooting 1-5 from deep. Caris LeVert (16 points, six assists), Nicolas Claxton (15 points, four rebounds) and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (12 points) all delivered strong performances while coming off the bench.

Denver still owned the six-point advantage at the half, and they entered the final period with a seven-point edge. However, Indiana would finally make its move late, racking up 41 points in the fourth quarter while limiting their hosts to 26. The Pacers finished the game with a 50.0 percent success rate from the floor, including 44.8 percent from three-point range.

Doug McDermott led the Pacers with 24 points, adding two rebounds and two assists. Domantas Sabonis generated a 22-point, 15-rebound, 10-assist triple-double across 41 minutes. T.J. Warren and Malcolm Brogdon posted matching 22-point, three-rebound tallies, with Brogdon also dishing out eight assists. Justin Holiday posted 14 points and four rebounds.

Nikola Jokic paced the Nuggets with a 30-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and three steals. Will Barton and Jerami Grant contributed 16 points apiece while pulling down seven and five rebounds, respectively. Mason Plumlee turned in 13 points, four assists and two boards. Michael Porter, Jr. finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and two steals.

The Pacers next pay a visit to the Utah Jazz on Monday night, while the Nuggets travel to take on the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night as well.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 133-130, at Smoothie King Center on Saturday afternoon.

The Clippers (30-13) checked into the contest looking to secure another win without star Paul George, who was sitting out another game with his hamstring injury. The Pelicans (16-27) were without a key piece themselves in Jrue Holiday (elbow), but it was hardly evident during a scorching first half during which they put up a whopping 80 points. However, Los Angeles put up 72 in its own right, remaining within striking distance and then managed to keep their eight-point deficit from increasing during a third quarter in which each team matched the other bucket for bucket. The visitors would ultimately stage a big comeback in the final period to take a six-point lead with as little as 31.6 seconds remaining, but J.J. Redick set himself up for a potential game-tying three-pointer by draining a 26-footer with 28.3 seconds left. However, the veteran sharpshooter would ultimately fail to find the net on that shot, sending the Clippers home with a narrow win. 

Kawhi Leonard led the way for the Clippers with 39 points, adding six rebounds, six assists, five steals and one block. Lou Williams contributed 32 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block. Montrezl Harrell compiled 24 points, while Landry Shamet furnished 11 points, four rebounds and one assist. 

Derrick Favors paced the Pelicans with a 22-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and one steal. Brandon Ingram turned in 21 points, seven boards, six assists and one steal. Redick finished with 19 points, two rebounds and two assists. Lonzo Ball contributed an 18-point, 11-assist, 10-rebound triple-double that also included two steals and one block. Jaxson Hayes delivered 14 points, five boards, four assists and one block.

The Clippers next pay a visit to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, while the Pelicans pay a visit to the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday afternoon.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Boston Celtics, 123-119, at TD Garden on Saturday night.

The Suns (18-24) caught a break when both Kemba Walker (knee) and Jaylen Brown (thumb) were announced as out for the Celtics (27-14). Phoenix took advantage of their depleted opponents early, taking a 60-51 lead into halftime. After they made it a double-digit advantage by tacking on another two points to their edge during the third, the visitors looked well-positioned for a road victory. However, Boston clawed all the way back to get to within 121-119 with 5.5 seconds remaining after a Jayson Tatum three-pointer. Devin Booker, who once again victimized the Celtics to the tune of a game-high 39 points, then sunk a pair of subsequent free throws to snuff out the comeback effort for good.

Booker added 10 rebounds, nine assists and two steals to his aforementioned scoring tally.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the New York Knicks, 90-87, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.

The 76ers (28-16) were once again forced to take the court without Joel Embiid (finger), but they seemed to be holding their own against the Knicks (11-32) early on. Philadelphia established a 52-46 halftime edge, but the lack of sufficient cushion came back to bite the visitors in the second half. New York shaved all but one point from its deficit during the third quarter, and they owned an 87-86 lead with as little as 31.3 seconds remaining before Tobias Harris and Furkan Korkmaz the 76ers back on top for good with a three-pointer and free throw, respectively. Marcus Morris then missed would-be game-tying 40-footer with just over a second left, sealing the loss for the home squad.

Ben Simmons led the 76ers with 21 points, adding eight assists, seven rebounds and two steals. Josh Richardson delivered 18 points, four assists, three rebounds, two steals and one block. Korkmaz poured in 17 points, while Harris supplied 15 points, eight rebounds and three assists. 

Morris paced the Knicks with 20 points, complementing them with six boards and three assists. Julius Randle and Reggie Bullock managed matching 14-point tallies, with Randle also pulling down 12 rebounds. Taj Gibson provided 11 points and four boards, while Elfrid Payton turned in 10 points, seven rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block. 

The 76ers travel to face the Brooklyn Nets on Monday afternoon, while the Knicks visit the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday afternoon as well.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the host Houston Rockets, 124-115, at Toyota Center on Saturday.

While Houston led by six points at the half, Los Angeles rode a 32-17 third quarter to take control. In fact, that allowed them to lead by at least seven points for the final 15 minutes of play. The Lakers ended up shooting 48 percent from the field while holding the Rockets to just 44 percent shooting. In addition, Los Angeles recorded five more assists than Houston while committing three fewer turnovers.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the New York Knicks, 121-98, at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night.

The Suns (16-24) improved to 6-4 during their last 10 games, and they seem to be trending in the right direction following some solid displays of late. Such was the case Thursday against the Knicks (11-31), as they bounced back from an ugly first quarter to secure a comfortable win on the road. New York jumped to a 32-25 lead following the first quarter, but Phoenix turned things around and a 33-20 second-quarter score allowed them to build a six-point lead at halftime. They would extend that lead even further in the remaining of the game, however, and they won the third (32-27) and fourth (31-19) quarters with absolute ease on their way to a comfortable win away from home. With this result, the Suns moved to 8-10 on the road while the Knicks fell to 6-14 at home.

Devin Booker led the way for the Suns with 29 points, four rebounds and four assists, but Ricky Rubio and DeAndre Ayton had strong performances as well.

It seemed as if the Pistons were going to lose a fourth straight contest, but they turned things around in the second half and won both the third (34-23) and fourth quarters (25-21) -- as a result, they cruised their way towards a solid win on the road. With the win, Detroit moved to 7-14 on the road while Boston fell to 16-4 at home.

Derrick Rose had a strong performance as a starter, and he finished the contest with 22 points and six assists. Sekou Doumbouya, however, was Detroit's main scoring weapon since he contributed 24 points while making 10 of his 13 field-goal attempts. Markieff Morris chipped in with 23 points off the bench, and Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk chipped in with 21 points in 29 minutes. Andre Drummond had 13 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.

Gordon Hayward led the way for the Celtics since he ended with 25 points and seven rebounds, but that wasn't enough. Kemba Walker had 19 points but only shared two assists, and Jaylen Brown chipped in with 24 points and 12 boards. No other Boston player scored in double digits, and the Celtics as a whole shot just 32.1 percent from three-point range.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 100-86, at Pepsi Center on Wednesday night.

The Nuggets (28-12) came into the contest with their starting backcourt ailing, as Jamal Murray was battling a back issue while Gary Harris was dealing with a groin injury.

Despite the health issues, Denver was able to take an impressive 57-42 lead over the Hornets (15-29) into intermission. Charlotte was able to knock 10 points off its deficit in the third quarter, but the home squad responded with a dominant final period in which they limited the visitors to just 17 points.

Terry Rozier paced the Hornets with 20 points, adding nine assists, three rebounds and one steal. P.J. Washington and Devonte' Graham generated matching 14-point, four-assist tallies. Miles Bridges matched his teammates' scoring total and added eight rebounds. Cody Zeller contributed 11 points.

iMichael Porter, Jr. led the Nuggets with 19 points and also collected eight rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block.

												The Miami Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 106-100, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday evening.

The Spurs (17-22) were coming off a win over the Toronto Raptors so they had their confidence quite high entering this matchup, but the Heat (28-12) blocked their attempts of earning another road win against an Eastern Conference contender with a strong performance late in the game that sealed the deal on their favor. Miami jumped ahead in the first quarter with a 24-17 score, but San Antonio turned things around with a 34-27 second quarter and a 26-24 third-period score. San Antonio entered the final 12 minutes of action up by just two points, but the Heat turned things around right on time. A 31-23 fourth quarter allowed Miami to secure a big win over the Spurs, and that result improved their stellar home record to 18-1. Meanwhile, the Spurs fell to 6-13 playing on the road.

Kendrick Nunn was the unsung hero for the Heat in this one, as the rookie exploded for 33 points while making 13 of his 18 field-goal attempts. Goran Dragic had 17 points off the bench, but three other starters delivered strong performances. Bam Adebayo sniffed a triple-double thanks to 14 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. Jimmy Butler had 12 points, and Duncan Robinson contributed 11 points and six rebounds.

DeMar DeRozan continued his stellar scoring run, and he finished with 30 points while making 12 of his 14 field-goal attempts. DeRozan also added five rebounds and seven assists to his name. LaMarcus Aldridge had 12 points and five rebounds in 34 minutes of action. Bryn Forbes had 11 points. Patty Mills had 21 points in 23 minutes coming off the bench.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 115-112, at Moda Center on Monday night.

The Trail Blazers (17-24) overcome a 26-25 first-quarter deficit in convincing fashion during the second period, outscoring the Hornets (15-28) by a 43-29 margin to take a 16-point halftime lead. However, Charlotte came back nearly as strong out of intermission, amassing 43 points of their own during a third period in which they erased all but two points from their deficit. That set up a photo finish, with Devonte' Graham pouring in a three-point bucket with 13.3 seconds left to bring the Hornets to within two. However, Graham's next shot, a would-be game-winner at the buzzer, was blocked by Kent Bazemore to secure Portland's victory.

Graham paced the Hornets with a 27-point, 10-assist tally that also included three rebounds and one steal. Terry Rozier contributed 25 points, seven boards and three assists. P.J. Washington generated a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists, two steals and two blocks. Willy Hernangomez managed 14 points, four boards and one block.

Damian Lillard led the Trail Blazers with 30 points, supplementing them with nine assists and four rebounds. C.J. McCollum registered 27 points, four rebounds, four assists and one block. Carmelo Anthony delivered 17 points, eight assists, six rebounds and one steal. Anthony Tolliver generated a 16-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one assist. Hassan Whiteside turned in seven points but pulled down 11 rebounds and recorded three blocks.

The Hornets next pay a visit to the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night, while the Trail Blazers visit the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night as well.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Sacramento Kings, 114-112, at Golden 1 Center on Monday night. 

The Magic (19-21) appeared to be set for a relatively comfortable road victory in the first half, as they racked up 65 points through the first two quarters. However, the Kings (15-25) managed to erase all but one point from their 13-point halftime deficit during a successful third period, Ultimately, Sacramento took a 113-112 lead with 15.8 seconds remaining, but Aaron Gordon's three-point play with 1.1 seconds left and misses by Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield within the last second, the latter on a tip shot following Barnes' miss, sealed Orlando's victory.

Nikola Vucevic paced the Magic with a 26-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included two assists and three blocks. Evan Fournier totaled 25 points, six assists and one steal. Gordon finished with 19 points, nine boards, two assists and one block. Markelle Fultz managed 16 points, four rebounds and two assists. 

Nemanja Bjelica led the Kings with 34 points, complementing them with seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. De'Aaron Fox pitched in 31 points, 10 assists, eight rebounds, one steal and one block. Marvin Bagley III posted 18 points, six boards and two blocks. Hield delivered 16 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 128-99, at Staples Center on Monday night. 

The Lakers (33-7) came into Monday's contest knowing they'd once again be without Anthony Davis (back), but that they'd also have the benefit of a returning LeBron James (illness). However, thanks in part to a slow start by James, Los Angeles trailed the Cavaliers (12-28) by a 48-47 margin at halftime. They'd come out a different team following intermission, however, finishing the third quarter with a 14-point advantage and then putting the game away with a 44-point tally in the final 12 minutes. James ultimately picked up the pace and led the with 31 points on 75.0 percent shooting, a season-best figure.

Kevin Love paced the Cavaliers with a 21-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists. Tristan Thompson generated 17 points, 10 boards, two assists and one steal. Collin Sexton and Darius Garland contributed matching 16-point, four-assist tallies. Cedi Osman furnished 15 points, four rebounds and one assist.

James supplemented his aforementioned scoring tally with eight assists, two rebounds and one steal. Dwight Howard pitched in a 21-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included two assists. Avery Bradley went for 12 points and three rebounds. Kyle Kuzma checked in with 11 points, three rebounds, two assists and one block. Danny Green and Alex Caruso poured in 10 points apiece, with Green also pulling down four rebounds and recording four steals.

The Cavaliers remain in Los Angeles to face the Clippers on Tuesday night, while the Lakers remain home and tangle with the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Miami Heat, 124-121, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon.

The Heat (27-12) seemed to have the game sealed against the struggling Knicks (11-29) at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, but the Knicks came from behind and used a sizzling run during the fourth quarter to steal an unlikely win against one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Miami jumped to a 31-27 lead following the first quarter, and they would extend their advantage during both the second (29-28) and third (34-29) quarters -- as a result, the Heat entered the final 12 minutes of action with a huge 10-point lead. The Knicks, however, came out of nowhere and scored 40 points in the final 12 minutes of action. That impressive scoring barrage allowed them to flip the score, and New York edged their rivals by a slim three-point margin. It was a huge win for the Knicks, as they improved their record to 7-9 over their last 16 games while moving to 6-13 at home. On the other hand, the Heat fell to 10-11 on the road.

Julius Randle was the best player for the Knicks in this game, as he ended with 26 points, eight rebounds and four assists. R.J. Barrett had another strong scoring output, and the rookie chipped in with 23 points while shooting 7-10 from the field. Reggie Bullock had 16 points, Taj Gibson contributed 14 and Elfrid Payton had 10 points with five assists. Kevin Knox II added 17 points coming off the bench.

Jimmy Butler was the best player for the Heat and he ended with 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Kendrick Nunn had 20 points, while Bam Adebayo once again filled the stat sheet and contributed 15 points, six rebounds and five assists. Duncan Robinson had 11 points, but he went 3-10 from deep. James Johnson (19 points) and Tyler Herro (15 points) delivered strong efforts off the bench as well.

The Jazz (27-12) were massive favorites on paper ahead of this Sunday matchup against the Wizards (13-26) but they had to shake off the rust to secure the win over the Capitol-based franchise. Washington jumped to a 34-23 lead following the first quarter, and they managed to remain on top at halftime since the second quarter ended with a 32-32 tie. Utah, however, would recover the advantage in the third quarter thanks to a 38-25 score and they would never relinquish that advantage again. The Jazz closed things out with a 34-25 score in the final quarter, as they ended winning by 11 points but the development of the game was tighter than what the score indicates. With the win, Utah moved to 12-9 on the road while the Wizards fell to 8-11 at home.

Miles Bridges amassed 14 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals. Cody Zeller totaled 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists off the bench as well.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Golden State Warriors, 122-102, at FedEx Forum on Sunday evening.

The Warriors (9-32) got a big talent boost Sunday with the return of D'Angelo Russell from a serious shoulder bruise, and accordingly, they were highly competitive in a first half that culminated with them trailing by a single point. However, the entire dynamic of the game shifted in the third quarter, when the Grizzlies (18-22) outscored Golden State by a 35-17 margin. That 19-point cushion would prove to be more than enough for a home victory that saw Memphis limit the visitors to 38.0 percent shooting and win the battle of the boards, 60-47. 

Russell paced the Warriors with 34 points, adding seven rebounds and four assists. Alec Burks and Jordan Poole posted 13 points apiece while pulling down six and three rebounds, respectively. Omari Spellman produced 12 points, four rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Glenn Robinson III supplied eight points, seven rebounds and two steals.

Jonas Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with a 31-point, 19-rebound double-double that also included one assist, two blocks and one steal. Jaren Jackson, Jr. registered 21 points, five boards, two assists, two blocks and one steal. Ja Morant followed with an 11-point, 10-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds and one steal. Tyus Jones and Grayson Allen went for 11 points each while dishing out four assists and pulling down four rebounds, respectively.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 114-104, at Pepsi Center on Sunday night.

The Clippers (27-13) came in once again missing Paul George (hamstring), but they took the fight to the Nuggets (27-12) early and forged a 30-29 lead through the first 12 minutes. However, Denver managed to change the dynamic of the game in the second quarter, erasing their slim deficit and building a 14-point edge going into halftime. That would prove to be enough for the home win, one that saw them shoot an impressive 44.0 percent from three-point range while limiting Los Angeles to a 24.2 percent success rate from distance.

Kawhi Leonard led the way for the Clippers with 30 points, complementing them with five rebounds, four assists and three steals. Lou Williams followed with 26 points, four rebounds, four assists and one steal. Montrezl Harrell finished with 25 points, eight boards, two blocks and one steal. Patrick Beverley tallied nine points, seven assists, six rebounds and one steal. 

Nikola Jokic paced the Nuggets with a 20-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included six assists and one steal. Jamal Murray tallied 19 points, four rebounds and two assists. Gary Harris poured in 15 points and complemented them with three rebounds, two assists and three steals. Michael Porter, Jr. compiled 13 points, four boards, one steal and one block.

The Rockets (26-12) got all they could handle from the Timberwolves (15-23) early, as they exited the first quarter with a narrow 22-20 edge. However, the middle quarters changed the dynamic of the game, as Houston outscored Minnesota by an 80-56 margin during that span.

Josh Okogie paced the Timberwolves with 16 points, adding five rebounds, five assists, four steals and one block. Jarrett Culver furnished 15 points, eight boards and five assists.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 140-105, at TD Garden on Saturday night.

The Celtics (26-11) came into the contest looking to put a recent frustrating stretch of play behind them, as they'd lost three consecutive games.

New Orleans managed to play more competitively in the second quarter, but they still trailed by 15 at halftime. The home squad then put the game away for good in the third, tacking on another 42 points to their total and 17 to their advantage. As the final score implies, the Celtics were especially efficient on offense, shooting 55.0 percent, including 48.3 percent from three-point range.

Frank Jackson led the way for the Pelicans with 22 points, adding two assists and a block. Jaxson Hayes went for 20 points, two boards, one assist and two blocks. Brandon Ingram delivered 16 points, five assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the New York Knicks, 123-111, at Madison Square Garden on Friday night.

The Pelicans (14-25) went into the game missing Jrue Holiday (elbow) for a third straight contest, but they still managed to rack up 67 first-half points thanks to some efficient performances from various members of the starting five. However, their defensive work wasn't quite up to par, which allowed the Knicks (10-29) to stay in close proximity by pouring in 62 points of their own in the first pair of quarters.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in overtime, 115-112, at Little Caesars Arena on Thursday night.

The Pistons (15-24) came into the contest with their usual laundry list of key injuries, making them particularly short-handed in the frontcourt. Detroit was highly efficient in the first half despite their multiple absences, building a 61-50 halftime lead. The Cavaliers (11-27) didn't let the game get away from them, however, shaving nine points off their deficit in the third and ultimately forcing overtime with a pair of clutch Tristan Thompson free throws with 24.5 seconds remaining. In the extra period, buckets from Kevin Love, Darius Garland and Thompson led to a 9-0 run that gave Cleveland a five-point lead with just 16.7 seconds remaining, helping to seal the win. 

Thompson led the way for the Cavaliers with a 35-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included three assists, three blocks and one steal. Garland finished with 20 points, seven assists and two rebounds. Collin Sexton contributed 19 points, six boards, one assist, two steals and two blocks. Love totaled 17 points, nine boards, three assists and one steal. Cedi Osman supplied 11 points, four rebounds and two assists.

Andre Drummond paced the Pistons with a 28-point, 23-rebound double-double that also included one assist, one steal and one block. Derrick Rose furnished 27 points, seven rebounds and five assists, although he missed a would-be game-tying three-pointer as time wound down in overtime. Bruce Brown registered 17 points, eight assists, four rebounds, four steals and two blocks. Tony Snell poured in 11 points and also dished out three assists and pulled down one rebound.

The Cavaliers remain on the road and tangle with the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night, while the Pistons remain home and face the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night as well.

Seven Miami players scored in double digits and, in a great showing of how a balanced attack should look, no player reached the 20-point mark. Tyler Herro paced everyone on the Heat with 19 points off the bench, while Derrick Jones Jr. and Bam Adebayo added 18 points of their own. Abedayo also had nine boards and four assists. Jimmy Butler chipped in with 14 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Duncan Robinson had 17 points, and Goran Dragic added 15 with four assists off the bench.

Domantas Sabonis was undoubtedly Indiana's best player in this game, as he finished with 27 points, 14 rebounds and six assists. Aaron Holiday had 14 points, and Jeremy Lamb chipped in with 13 points. Justin Holiday contributed 14 points and Edmond Sumner added 13 both off the bench.

The Hawks kept fighting through the fourth and outscored the Rockets by seven in the quarter, but it was too little, too late.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 107-106, at American Airlines Center on Wednesday night.

Two of the Western Conference's best unsurprisingly were locked in a tight battle right from the opening tip, with the Mavericks (23-14) owning a slim 59-56 halftime lead. Each team then matched each other bucket for bucket in the third quarter, but the Nuggets (26-11) managed to take their defense to a new level in the final 12 minutes. Denver limited Dallas to just 17 points during the final period, and a Nikola Jokic driving layup with 7.9 seconds remaining ultimately proved to be the game-winning basket.

Jokic paced the Nuggets with 33 points, complementing them with seven assists, six rebounds, one steal and one block. Jerami Grant turned in 15 points, five boards, two assists, three blocks and one steal. Jamal Murray registered 14 points, five assists and three rebounds. Mason Plumlee and Malik Beasley generated matching 10-point, five-rebound tallies. 

Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 27 points while also dishing out 10 assists and nine rebounds. Dwight Powell followed with 16 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Tim Hardaway, Jr. and Seth Curry poured in 15 and 14 points, respectively. Maxi Kleber supplied 13 points, seven boards, one assist, one steal and one block. 

The Nuggets return home to take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night, while the Mavericks remain home and take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Chicago Bulls, 123-108, at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday night.

The Pelicans (13-25) came into the contest without star guard Jrue Holiday (elbow), but the Bulls (13-25) also were missing Wendell Carter Jr. (ankle). The two injury-hampered squads engaged in a back-and-forth battle throughout the first half, which fittingly culminated in a 48-48 halftime deadlock. However, the dynamic of the game would change in a prolific third quarter for New Orleans, one in which they posted 44 points while holding Chicago to 27. That 17-point cushion would prove to be enough, even in a final period during which the visitors scored an impressive 33 points.

Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 32 points, adding six assists, five rebounds and two steals. Thaddeus Young followed with 18 points, six rebounds, two assists and three steals. Kris Dunn furnished 15 points, seven assists, four rebounds and five steals. Lauri Markkanen posted 14 points, four rebounds and one assist. Coby White totaled a bench-leading 10 points and complemented them with six rebounds and two assists.

Brandon Ingram paced the Pelicans with 29 points, complementing them with 11 assists, eight rebounds and two blocks. J.J. Redick contributed 24 points, four rebounds, four assists and one steal. Jaxson Hayes contributed a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included four blocks. Josh Hart supplied 13 points, six rebounds, one assist and three steals. Derrick Favors managed 12 points and nine boards. Lonzo Ball and Nickeil Alexander-Walker generated matching 11-point tallies while dishing out seven and six assists, respectively.

The Bulls return home to take on the Indiana Pacers on Friday night, while the Pelicans visit the New York Knicks on Friday night as well.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the visiting New York Knicks, 128-104, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Wednesday.

While this wasn't necessarily a wire-to-wire win for Utah, they never trailed after the opening three minutes. In fact, they rode a 39-29 first quarter to a big lead then put it away with a 33-24 second quarter and a 23-16 third quarter. That allowed them to lead by 26 points heading into the fourth quarter, as New York never got the game within 18 from there. Utah ended up out-rebounding New York, 50-41, while out-assisting them, 29-18. That allowed the Jazz to shoot 54 percent from the field while holding the Knicks to just 43 percent shooting.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 120-113, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday evening.

The 76ers (24-14) entered this game losing seven of their last 10 against a red-hot Thunder (20-16) squad that had gone 9-1 over their last 10 matchups. However, Philadelphia looked in control right after the start of the contest and despite a 31-31 score following the first quarter, the Sixers pulled away for good in the second quarter with a 31-21 score. They would never relinquish that advantage, however, despite the fact the Thunder won the third quarter by a 34-28 score. The Sixers won the final quarter by a 30-27 score, and that was enough to give them a huge – and much-needed – win over a tough opponent at home. With the win, Philadelphia moved to 17-2 at home while the Thunder fell to 8-10 on the road.

Redick in the final 58.6 seconds to escape with the victory, including a controversial game-ending block of Ingram by Rudy Gobert.

Bojan Bogdanovic paced the Jazz with 35 points. Joe Ingles followed with 22 points, six assists, two rebounds and two steals. Mitchell finished with 19 points, six assists, four rebounds and one steal. Jordan Clarkson poured in 17  points to lead the bench, while Gobert mustered nine points but pulled down 19 rebounds.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 106-99, at Staples Center on Sunday.

While there were only five ties and four lead changes in this game, it came down to the wire. In fact, Los Angeles trailed by four heading into the fourth quarter but started on a 15-0 run. Detroit then responded with an 11-0 run and that made it close for the final few minutes. That big run to start the quarter was too much though, with Los Angeles outscoring Detroit, 31-20, in that final quarter. Rim protection was critical for the Lakers, recording 20 blocks to the Pistons six. Los Angeles ended up shooting 46 percent from the field while holding Detroit to just 37 percent shooting. 

The Pistons (13-24) were led by Derrick Rose, who generated 28 points, three rebounds and five assists off the bench. Andre Drummond led the starters with 12 points, 18 rebounds and four blocks. Langston Galloway also played well off the bench, providing 13 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. 

The Lakers (29-7) got a triple-double from LeBron James, who tallied 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. Anthony Davis finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds, three steals and eight blocks. Alex Caruso led the bench with 13 points, three rebounds and three assists. Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee combined for 11 blocks out of the center position as well. 

Both teams return to action on Tuesday, with Los Angeles remaining home to face the resurgent New York Knicks and Detroit staying on the road to play the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 140-114, at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon.

The visitors were highly efficient offensively, shooting 51.0 percent, including 46.2 percent from three-point range.

Jae Crowder led the Grizzlies with 27 points, adding eight rebounds, seven assists, three steals and three blocks. Jaren Jackson Jr. tallied 24 points, six boards and four blocks.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 121-102, at Barclays Center on Saturday evening.

The Raptors (23-12) were not quite up to the task of keeping pace with a red-hot Nets (16-18) squad in the first quarter, with Brooklyn forging a 33-24 lead through the first 12 minutes. However, Toronto would begin to chip away beginning in the second quarter, shaving five points off their deficit heading into halftime before eradicating it altogether and taking a three-point advantage during the third period. They then thrived on both ends of the floor in the fourth quarter, outscoring their hosts by a comfortable 38-22 margin to seal the road win.

Fred VanVleet paced the Raptors with 29 points, adding 11 assists, four rebounds and one block. Kyle Lowry supplied 26 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block. Serge Ibaka generated a 21-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included one block. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson posted 10 points, five rebounds, two assists and four steals.

Spencer Dindwiddie led the Nets with 23 points, complementing them with seven assists, three rebounds and one block. Joe Harris poured in 18 points and also collected five assists and three rebounds. Caris LeVert totaled 13 points in his return from a 24-game absence due to a thumb injury, while Garrett Temple managed 12 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Taurean Prince furnished 10 points, six boards, two assists and one block.

The Raptors remain on the road and take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night, while the Nets pay a visit to the Orlando Magic on Monday night.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the host Dallas Mavericks in overtime, 123-120, at American Airlines Center on Saturday. 

There were five ties and 10 lead changes in this game, as it took an overtime session to determine a winner. Luka Doncic actually had two opportunities to tie the game, missing a three at the end of regulation then missing a halfcourt prayer at the end of overtime. The key for the Hornets was their rebounding, out-rebounding the Mavericks, 53-41. In addition, Charlotte shot 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range while holding Dallas to 47 percent from the field and 30 percent from long range. The Hornets also went 28-of-31 from the free-throw line while the Mavs hit just 11-of-13. 

The Hornets (15-23) were led by Terry Rozier and his 29 points, six rebounds and eight assists. DeVonte' Graham tallied 27 points, two rebounds and 13 assists. P.J. Washington amassed 19 points, six rebounds and three assists. Bismack Biyombo and Mikal Bridges each recorded double-doubles, combining for 22 points and 24 rebounds. 

The Mavericks (22-13) got a triple-double from Luka Doncic, who collected 39 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and two steals. Dorian Finney-Smith totaled 15 points and eight rebounds. J.J. Barea got a rare start and generated 11 points, three rebounds and nine assists. Maxi Kleber led the bench with 24 points, four rebounds and two assists. 

Both teams return to action on Monday, with Dallas remaining home to play the Chicago Bulls and Charlotte returning home to face the Indiana Pacers.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Orlando Magic, 109-96, at Amway Center on Saturday night. 

The Jazz (23-12) wasted no time getting off to a fast start, establishing a 33-25 lead through the first 12 minutes, but the Magic (16-20) showed plenty of fight over the middle periods.

The Pacers (22-13) came into the contest short-handed, as Malcolm Brogdon (back) was ruled out earlier in the day. However, Indiana jumped out to a rather surprising 37-27 lead through the first 12 minutes, but the Nuggets (24-10) had erased all but two points from their deficit by halftime. Denver continued to play well on both ends of the floor coming out of intermission and ultimately headed into the fourth quarter with a four-point advantage. Indiana would get as close as 107-104 with 6:33 remaining before the visitors pulled away.

Michael Porter, Jr. paced the Nuggets with a career-high 25 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds and one assist. Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray followed with 22 points apiece, with Jokic pulling down seven rebounds and Murray dishing out seven assists. Will Barton generated a 16-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included five assists and two steals. Gary Harris supplied 12 points, five assists, three rebounds and one steal.

Jeremy Lamb led the Pacers with 30 points and also furnished six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Myles Turner totaled 21 points and five rebounds. T.J. Warren registered 20 points, five boards, two assists and two steals. Domantas Sabonis delivered 18 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals and one block. Aaron Holiday mustered six points but dished out 10 assists.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Toronto Raptors, 84-76, at AmericanAirlines Arena on Thursday evening.

The Heat (25-9) and the Raptors (23-12) were set to play a marquee matchup between two of the best teams of the Eastern Conference this season, and the game didn’t disappoint. Despite the fact it was a low-scoring affair, it seemed both teams were always going back and forth with no clear dominant force. Toronto jumped to a 20-18 lead after the first quarter, but Miami flipped the script with a 24-19 score in the second quarter to earn a three-point lead at the break. The third quarter ended with a 21-21 score, but Miami pulled away for good with a 21-16 score in the final 12 minutes of action. With the win, Miami extended their solid record at home to 16-1, while the Raptors fell to 9-7 on the road.

Only four players scored in double digits for the Heat, but the only starter who topped that figure was Bam Adebayo who ended with 15 points and 14 rebounds. Goran Dragic and Tyler Herro each had 13 points off the bench, while Derrick Jones Jr. ended with 10 points and six rebounds. Jimmy Butler struggled from the field since he had eight points (shooting 2-10) but added 12 rebounds and seven assists.

Serge Ibaka scored a game-high 19 points for the Raptors, and he also added 10 rebounds. OG Anunoby ended with a double-double of 12 points and 12 boards. Kyle Lowry finished with 15 points and eight assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson chipped in with 13 points in 29 minutes off the bench. Fred VanVleet struggled and scored seven points while shooting 3-16 from the field.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Golden State Warriors, 99-84, at Target Center on Thursday night. 

The TImberwolves (13-21) came into the contest without their two best players in Karl-Anthony Towns (knee) and Andrew Wiggins, but they nevertheless opened the game on a 34-19 run through the first 12 minutes. Although the Warriors (9-27) were more competitive in the second quarter, Minnesota still owned a 17-point edge at halftime. Ultimately, Golden State narrowly outscored their hosts by a 43-41 margin in the second half, but thanks to the T-Wolves' considerable cushion, it wasn't near enough to overcome their early hole.

Glenn Robinson III paced the Warriors with 16 points, adding six rebounds and one assist. Eric Paschall tallied 13 points and seven rebounds. Omari Spellman and Damion Lee generated matching 10-point contributions, with Spellman also pulling down five boards. 

Robert Covington and Shabazz Napier led the Timberwolves with matching 20-point efforts, with Covington also posting 10 boards and Napier dishing out seven assists. Naz Reid totaled 13 points, six rebounds, one assist and one block. Kelan Martin provided 12 points, eight boards and one assist. Jarrett Culver pitched in 10 points, five rebounds, one assist and one steal. 

The Warriors head back home to take on the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night, while the Timberwolves pay a visit to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards, 122-101, at Capital One Arena on Wednesday evening.

The Magic (15-19) dominated the game from start to finish, and they didn’t have major issues to take advantage of a struggling Wizards (10-23) team that was seriously depleted by injuries.

The Knicks took it to another level in the fourth, as they outscored the visitors by 18 in the quarter, to seal their third consecutive win. 

Marcus Morris Sr. added 18 points, seven rebounds and three assists, while Frank Ntilikina was big for the Knicks, with nine points, 10 assists, three rebounds, two blocks and a steal, in 23 minutes off the bench. 

Meanwhile, Hassan Whiteside added 17 points, 12 rebounds, three blocks and two assists. C.J. McCollum added 17 points, four rebounds and four assists, and Damian Lillard totalled 11 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 106-104, at Fiserv Forum on Wednesday night.

The Bucks (31-5) seemingly came into the interconference matchup with every advantage, as not only did they own a markedly better record than the Timberwolves (12-21), but Minnesota came in with multiple key injuries as well. However, it was the visitors that owned a surprising 23-19 lead after one quarter, and that trailed by just one point at halftime. Milwaukee managed to create some modest distance during the third quarter by adding five points to their advantage, yet the game would still come down the buzzer. After the Timberwolves got to within two points with 46.2 seconds remaining, Gorgui Dieng missed a potential game-tying jumper and Giannis Antetokounmpo blocked a Robert Covington's desperation three-point attempt as time expired to seal the victory. 

Shabazz Napier led the Timberwolves with 22 points, adding six rebounds, three assists and one block. Dieng totaled 15 points, six boards, one assist and one block. Josh Okogie and Jaylen Nowell managed matching 12-point tallies while pulling down four and two rebounds, respectively. Naz Reid poured in 11 points, while Keita Bates-Diop supplied 10 points, three rebounds, one assist and one steal. Covington mustered just seven points but also posted 11 rebounds, three assists, three steals and one block.

Antetokounmpo paced the Bucks with 32 points and also compiled 17 rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Khris Middleton registered 13 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two steals. Brook Lopez collected 11 points, four boards, three assists, six blocks and one steal. Eric Bledsoe delivered 10 points, six rebounds, two assists and two blocks. 

The Timberwolves head back home and tangle with the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night, while the Bucks remain home and face the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday night.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns, 117-107, at Staples Center on Wednesday.

A 43-17 first quarter really set the tone in this game for the Lakers, winning in wire-to-wire fashion. In fact, Los Angeles led by up to 36 points but Phoenix fought all the way back to get it to a seven-point margin in the final minute thanks to a 66-43 second half. With that said, that was the closest they got after the opening five minutes. Los Angeles was able to prevail despite losing the rebounding, assisting, field goal percentage, three-point shooting, fastbreak scoring and points in the paint battles. The only real advantage for the Lakers was their defense, recording nine steals and five blocks to the Suns seven steals and three blocks. 

The Suns (13-21) were led by Devin Booker, who tallied 32 points, two rebounds and seven assists. Kelly Oubre Jr amassed 26 points, six rebounds, three assists and three steals. Ricky Rubio accumulated six points, five rebounds and nine assists while DeAndre Ayton led the bench with 16 points and 14 rebounds. 

The Lakers (27-7) got a triple-double from LeBron James, who collected 31 points, 13 rebounds, 12 assists and two steals. Anthony Davis totaled 26 points, 11 rebounds and two assists. Avery Bradley generated 18 points, five rebounds and three steals on 9-of-11 shooting while Kyle Kuzma led the bench with 19 points. 

Both teams return to action on Friday against resurgent teams, with Phoenix returning home to play the New York Knicks and Los Angeles playing host to the New Orleans Pelicans.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 109-92, at Spectrum Center on Tuesday afternoon.

The Celtics (23-8) and the Hornets (13-23) aimed to end the year on a strong note, but it seemed the Celtics were the only team able to execute since they wasted no time to get the win here following a dominant performance on both ends of the court. Boston quickly jumped to a 24-18 lead in the first quarter, and they would never look back afterwards. Boston won the second quarter by a 26-25 score and while the third one ended with a 30-30 draw, both teams knew the game was essentially over heading into the final 12 minutes of action thanks to Boston's seven point lead. Charlotte couldn't bounce back down the stretch and the Celtics won the final quarter by 10 points, so Boston cruised their way and ended earning a 17-point victory over their Eastern Conference foes. With the win, the Celtics improved to 10-6 on the road while the Hornets fell to 7-11 at home.

Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward all surpassed the 20-point mark for the Celtics in this win. Walker had 22 points with seven assists and four rebounds, Hayward had 21 points with 10 boards and six dimes, and Tatum paced the team with 24 points and seven rebounds along with three steals. Enes Kanter produced off the bench and ended with 13 points and 14 boards in 23 minutes off the bench.

Six Charlotte players scored in double figures, but that didn't seem to matter once everything was said and done. Rookie P.J. Washington had 15 points for the Hornets, while Miles Bridges had 14 points with 10 rebounds for the losing cause. Terry Rozier had 10 points and Devonte' Graham chipped in with 11, but both players struggled from the field. The backcourt duo combined for a 28.0 percent from the field in this defeat.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 115-97, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Tuesday afternoon.

Both the Pacers (22-12) and the 76ers (23-13) entered this game riding two-game losing streaks, but Indiana ended that skid with a strong performance in front of their fans that saw them dominate through the first three quarters with absolute ease. The Pacers got ahead after the first 12 minutes of action by a 29-27 score, but they pulled away for good in the second quarter with a 38-16 score and they would never look back. Indiana also won the third quarter by a 29-23 score, so the final 12 minutes were nothing more than garbage time. Philadelphia won the final quarter 31-19, but the game was entirely decided and the Pacers ended their two-game losing run in style against one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. With the win, Indiana moved to 15-3 at home while the Sixers fell to 7-11 on the road.

Domantas Sabonis was the best player for the Pacers, as the Lithuanian big man ended with 23 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Myles Turner had 14 points and five rebounds, while T.J. Warren chipped in with 21 points. Jeremy Lamb had 13 points and T.J. McConnell had 11 points with 10 assists coming off the bench. Malcolm Brogdon only played eight minutes before exiting with a back injury.

The Sixers didn't have Joel Embiid and missed him dearly, as their leading scorer was Josh Richardson who ended with 20 points and five assists. Ben Simmons had 18 points and 10 rebounds, but he also committed six turnovers. No other Philadelphia player scored in double figures, as household names such as Al Horford (five points) and Tobias Harris (nine points) also struggled in this one.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Miami Heat, 123-105, at Capital One Arena on Monday evening.

The Wizards (10-22) entered this game following a negative run of eight losses in their last 10 contests while the Heat (24-9) were on a five-game winning run, so it was clear Miami were heavy favorites ahead of this contest even if they were playing on the road. However, Miami didn't have a good performance in this contest and they only shot 45.2 percent from the field, while the Wizards converted 51.2 percent of their shots and 45.9 percent from three-point range. Washington, however, got off to a slow start since the Heat built a 39-29 lead following the first quarter. The Wizards turned things around as the game progressed and a 42-24 second quarter gave them a lead they would never relinquish. The Wizards won the remaning two quarters as well, 19-18 and 33-24 respectively, and ended clinching one of their biggest wins of the season. With the victory, the Wizards moved up to 5-8 at home while the Heat fell to 9-8 on the road.

The Wizards were quite depleted ahead of this game, but some role players stepped up big time to post impressive performances. Ian Mahinmi had 25 points, five rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Garrison Mathews chipped in with 28 points and four boards. Jordan McRae added 29 points, eight assists, four rebounds and two steals. Ish Smith finished with 19 points and seven dimes.

Jimmy Butler led the way for the Heat with 27 points, six rebounds and four assists -- he was the only Miami player to surpass the 20-point mark. Duncan Robinson had 16 points, while Bam Adebayo filled the stat sheet with 14 points, 14 rebounds, and five assists. Kendrick Nunn added 14 points, and Goran Dragic chipped in with 10 points off bench.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 123-102, at United Center on Monday night. 

The Bucks (30-5) came into the day not knowing if they'd have Giannis Antetokounmpo (back) available, but the star big man was ultimately able to take the floor. He helped Milwaukee rack up 31 points in the first quarter, but the Bulls (13-21) battled back to cut an 11-point deficit to three by halftime. However, the visitors changed the dynamic of the contest in the third period, opening up their advantage to 18 points with a 40-point tally during the quarter. The Bucks ultimately shot a stellar 54.8 percent and won the battle of the boards by a 59-43 margin. 

Khris Middleton paced the Bucks with 25 points, adding six rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block. Antetokounmpo followed with 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Eric Bledsoe provided 15 points, three rebounds, three assists and four steals. Ersan Ilyasova generated a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists. Robin and Brook Lopez posted matching 11-point tallies while pulling down six and four rebounds, respectively. 

Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 19 points, adding five assists and four rebounds. Lauri Markkanen and Coby White compiled 18 points each, with Markkanen also pulling in six rebounds and White recording four steals. Wendell Carter Jr. and Tomas Satoransky posted 10 points apiece.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Detroit Pistons, 104-81, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday night.

The Jazz (21-12) may have been guilty of taking the struggling Pistons (12-22) too lightly at the onset, as they were surprisingly outscored by a 21-19 margin through the first 12 minutes. Utah still trailed by a one-point margin at halftime, but they changed the dynamic of the game in the third quarter by building a 10-point advantage going into the final period. The hosts then saw their offense come alive in the fourth quarter, as they outscored Detroit by a 36-23 margin to close out lopsided home win.

Derrick Rose paced the Pistons with 20 points, adding four assists, one steal and one block.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 119-110, at Pepsi Center on Saturday afternoon.

A battle between two teams with drastically different records got off to an unsurprising start, as the home-court Nuggets (22-9) jumped out to a 26-11 lead through the first 12 minutes.

Ja Morant turned in 16 points, eight assists, three rebounds and one block. Brandon Clarke checked in with 15 points, five assists, two rebounds and one block.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 117-116, in overtime at American Airlines Arena on Saturday night. 

The 76ers (23-12) knew they'd have a battle on their hands against a Heat (24-8) team that came in with only one home loss, but they took the fight to their hosts early to the tune of a 33-28 first-quarter lead. After the two teams matched each other bucket for bucket in the second quarter, Miami managed to open up a six-point lead entering the final period.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 129-117, at TD Garden on Friday afternoon.

The Celtics (22-7) came into the contest with only one loss in 13 home games, and their first-quarter play served as a good example of why. Boston played impressively on both ends of the floor on its way to a 33-22 lead through the first 12 minutes, and their advantage was 15 by halftime. However, the Cavaliers (9-22) fought valiantly coming out of intermission, scoring 70 points in the second half alone. Unfortunately for Cleveland, its hosts nearly matched them basket for basket by ringing up 67 points of their own through the third and fourth quarters, leading to a double-digit road loss for the visitors.

Kevin Love paced the Cavaliers with 30 points, adding seven rebounds and four assists. Collin Sexton provided 21 points, four boards, two assists and one steal. Kevin Porter, Jr. turned in 16 points, four assists and three boards. Tristan Thompson tallied 12 points, seven boards and one steal. Cedi Osman contributed 10 points, five rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block.

Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 34 points, complementing them with nine rebounds and two assists. Jayson Tatum managed 30 points, five boards, two assists and two blocks. Enes Kanter registered 14 points, nine boards, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Kemba Walker delivered 13 points on 5-for-15 shooting but also recorded four rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Daniel Theis filled out the stat sheet with nine points, six boards, two assists, two steals and two blocks.

The Cavaliers next pay a visit to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night, while the Celtics remain home and take on the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night as well.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Charlotte Hornets, 104-102, at Spectrum Center on Friday evening. 

It took overtime to solve the contest, as Devonte' Graham capped off a Hornets' rally to tie the game with one second left in regulation. The Thunder led by seven points after three quarters, but the Hornets started the fourth on a 12-2 run, to grab a three-point lead with seven minutes to go. The Thunder came back and grabbed the edge in the final minutes, before Graham sent it to overtime. The Thunder caught a break heading into overtime, as the Hornets were assessed a technical foul at the end of regulation because Terry Rozier threw the ball into the stands. The Thunder hit their free throw to begin overtime with a one-point lead and went on to hold the advantage the rest of the way, earning their fifth win in their last six games.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 98-97, at Amway Center on Friday night. 

The Magic (14-17) came into the contest having notched nine of their 13 wins on their home court, but it was clear from early on they'd be in for a tough task against the 76ers (23-11). Philadelphia forged a 21-19 lead through the first 12 minutes and owned a slim one-point lead at halftime. Orlando managed to erase that deficit and take a three-point lead into the fourth quarter, but Joel Embiid's three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining brought the visitors within one. A subsequent turnover by Aaron Gordon on the inbounds pass led to Ben Simmons feeding Embiid for a potential game-winning heave from just within half court that failed to find the basket, sending the hosts home winners.

Embiid and Tobias Harris paced the 76ers with matching 24-point, 11-rebound tallies. Josh Richardson followed with 15 points, six assists, three rebounds, three steals and one block. Ben Simmons supplied 13 points, nine rebounds, seven assists and four steals. Al Horford mustered seven points, five assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block.

Evan Fournier paced the Magic with 20 points, adding six assists, two rebounds and two steals. Aaron Gordon generated a 19-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and one block. Terrence Ross delivered 17 points, seven boards and one steal. Nikola Vucevic posted a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included seven assists. Markelle Fultz registered 13 points, six assists and three rebounds. 

The 76ers next face the Miami Heat on Saturday night, while the Magic visit the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night as well.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Atlanta Hawks, 112-86, at State Farm Arena on Friday evening.

They kept control through the second, as they outscored the Hawks by 10 in the quarter, to take a 23-point lead into halftime. Unfortunately, Trae Young went down late in the second quarter and did not return. Nonetheless, the Hawks put up a fight in the third quarter and trimmed the deficit by two.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns, 105-96, at Chase Center on Friday. 

It's rare to see a team win the first four quarters by four points apiece and lose but that was the case here. In fact, Golden State rode a 39-18 fourth quarter to their comeback victory, turning a 12-point fourth quarter deficit into a nine-point victory. The Suns couldn't take care of the ball, committing 26 turnovers to the Warriors 10. In addition, Golden State recorded 10 steals and five blocks while Phoenix had just six steals and one block. That allowed the Warriors to win the points off turnovers battle, 28-7. The Warriors also held the Suns to just 7-of-33 from three-point range. 

The Suns (11-20) were led by Devin Booker, who tallied 34 points, three rebounds, four assists and two steals but committed eight turnovers. Ricky Rubio accrued 11 points, four rebounds and four assists. Dario Saric amassed 11 points, 10 rebounds and two assists while Aron Baynes totaled nine points and 10 boards. 

The Warriors (9-24) were led by D'Angelo Russell and his 31 points, five rebounds and six assists. Damion Lee accumulated 16 points, eight rebounds, two assists and three steals. Draymond Green collected 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists while Alec Burks led the bench with 13 points and five rebounds. 

Both teams have to play the second half of a back-to-back set on Saturday, with Golden State remaining home to face the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix staying on the road to play the Sacramento Kings.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Washington Wizards, 132-102, at Little Caesars Arena on Thursday.

The Pistons (12-20) and the Wizards (9-21) entered this game as two of the worst teams in the Eastern Conference, but that didn’t seem to matter here since Detroit had no problems to win, as they delivered a strong performance on both ends of the court from start to finish. It seemed as if the Pistons were a contender, while the Wizards looked like a team that was seriously lacking talent throughout the entire contests. Detroit won the first three quarters – 31-23, 37-25 and 38-28, respectively – and the final 12 minutes didn’t have an impact in the outcome of the game. With the win, Detroit moved to 8-10 at home while the Wizards fell to 5-14 on the road.

Eight Pistons scored in double digits and the top scorer came off the bench, as Christian Wood ended with 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Andre Drummond had 14 points and 10 boards, while Blake Griffin chipped in with 14 points, 11 rebounds and four assists. Derrick Rose had 15 points and six dimes as substitute, while Bruce Brown added 12 points in 27 minutes.

Bradley Beal scored 15 points for the Wizards, and he was the only starter who topped the 10-point mark in this game. Anzejs Pasecniks led the way for the team with 17 points, while Jordan McRae chipped in with 15 points. Troy Brown Jr. had 13 points with six rebounds, while Gary Payton II filled the stat sheet once again thanks to 10 points, five rebounds, and five assists.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Sacramento Kings in double overtime, 105-104, at Golden 1 Center on Thursday night. 

The Timberwolves (11-19) and Kings (12-19) played a see-saw first half that saw each take a quarter and culminate in a narrow 50-48 halftime lead for Minnesota. However, Sacramento seemed to take control in a third quarter where they eliminated their deficit and built an eight-point lead going into the final period, The visitors then managed to force overtime, and after both teams deadlocked at seven points during the first extra period, Buddy Hield got the  Kings to within one point with a pair of buckets before missing a 26-foot three-point attempt at time expired, leaving the hosts just one point short.

Gorgui Dieng led the way for the Timberwolves with a 21-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included two steals and one block. Robert Covington totaled 19 points and eight boards. Andrew Wiggins went for 18 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Jeff Teague provided 15 points, six boards, three assists and one block. Treveon Graham had nine points and five rebounds. 

RIchaun Holmes paced the Kings with a 20-point, 18-rebound double-double that also included three assists, two steals and two blocks. Bogdan Bogdanovic furnished 19 points, seven rebounds, two assists, three blocks and one steal. Marvin Bagley turned in 18 points, four rebounds and one steal. Hield registered 17 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal while going just 6-for-20 from the field. Harrison Barnes posted an 11-point, 10-rebound double-double.

The Timberwolves head back home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night, while the Kings remain home and tangle with the Utah Jazz on Saturday night as well.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 121-115, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Thursday night.

The Jazz (19-12) seemed to be setting the tone for a comfortable home win early, forging a 37-22 lead through one quarter and keeping a 10-point advantage going into halftime. The Trail Blazers (14-18) weren't able to really get their offense humming until the final period, which they entered trailing by 20. Portland within two points on multiple occasions in the latter portion of the fourth quarter, but a quartet of free throws from Bojan Bogdanovic (three) and Donovan Mitchell (one) over the final 15.1 seconds helped Utah gain just enough separation for the victory.

Damian Lillard paced the Trail Blazers with 34 points, adding eight assists and four rebounds. C.J. McCollum furnished 25 points, four boards, two assists and one steal. Anfernee Simons managed 15 points and 10 rebounds.  Carmelo Anthony compiled 12 points, seven boards and one steal. Skal Labissiere supplied 10 points, seven rebounds and three assists. 

Mitchell led the Jazz with 35 points -- 28 of them in the second half -- while complementing them with seven assists and three rebounds. Joe Ingles registered 26 points, five boards, four assists and one steal. Rudy Gobert and Bogdanovic generated matching 16-point tallies, with Gobert also pulling down 15 rebounds, two assists and one block. 

The Trail Blazers head back home to take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night, while the Jazz pay a visit to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Toronto Raptors, 118-102, at Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday afternoon.

The Celtics (21-7) entered this game on a solid run of form, having won their last three and seven of their last 10 contests, while also securing three straight wins on the road. As such, it’s not a surprise that they didn’t have problems to register another solid win against a struggling Raptors (21-10) team that was slightly depleted due to injuries. Boston jumped to a 28-19 lead in the first quarter, and they would never look back after that. Toronto won the second quarter by a 28-27 score, but Boston pulled away for good with a 33-22 third quarter that made the final 12 minutes a mere formality. The Raptors won the final quarter by a 33-30 score, but the game was over a while ago, and Boston secured a great win against another Eastern Conference contender. With the win, the Celtics moved to 9-6 on the road while the Raptors fell to 13-4 at home.

Jaylen Brown was the best player for the Celtics in this game, as he finished with 30 points, six rebounds and four assists. Kemba Walker chipped in with 22 points and four assists, while Gordon Hayward added 14 points and six dimes. Jayson Tatum came close to a double-double thanks to 11 points and nine rebounds, while also adding five assists. Enes Kanter had a double-double off the bench with 12 points and 11 rebounds.

Fred VanVleet led the way for Toronto with 27 points, six assists and four steals. Kyle Lowry had 14 points with eight dimes, while Serge Ibaka chipped in with 12 points and eight rebounds. Chris Boucher came off the bench and contributed 24 points and six rebounds in 28 minutes. No other Toronto player managed to score in double digits.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 121-109, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday afternoon.

The 76ers (23-10) and the Bucks (27-5) were slated to deliver one of the most thrilling matchups during the Christmas Day schedule, and it’s safe to say they delivered as expected. The 76ers, however, dominated with ease and they ended securing a huge win against one of the league’s top teams in front of their own crowd. Philadelphia jumped to a 38-30 lead after the first quarter, and they never looked back afterwards. Their 31-18 second quarter extended their advantage to double digits, and the 31-25 score in the third quarter iced the game for good. Milwaukee won the final 12 minutes by a 26-21 margin, but the game was already decided by then. The 76ers secured a huge win that should remind everyone they are one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference.

Joel Embiid (31 points, 11 rebounds), Ben Simmons (15 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds) and Al Horford (11 points, 11 rebounds, five assists) all had double-doubles for the 76ers, although Tobias Harris also contributed offensively thanks to a 22-point performance. Josh Richardson added 18 points and four assists, while Furkan Korkmaz impressed with 16 points while shooting 4-for-5 from deep off the bench.

Khris Middleton was Milwaukee’s top scoring threat since he had 31 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo filled the stat sheet with 18 points, 14 rebounds and four assists, but he shot 8-27 from the field and 0-7 from three-point range. Brook Lopez had 11 points with five boards. George Hill impressed off the bench as he ended with 15 points while making all three of his three-point attempts.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the visiting Houston Rockets, 116-104, at Chase Center on Christmas Day. 

The Warriors got out to a good start at home, with an early 7-0 lead, but the Rockets rallied to take a 29-28 lead by the end of the quarter.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 111-106, at Staples Center on Wednesday night. 

The Clippers (23-10) and Lakers (24-7) unsurprisingly engaged in a spirited battle for all four quarters, and a highly competitive first quarter foreshadowed what was to come. The Clippers held a narrow 33-31 lead after the first 12 minutes, but the Lakers bounced back to erase their two-point deficit and establish an eight-point edge going into halftime. The designated visitors flipped the tables on their hosts for the night in the third by reclaiming a four-point lead by quarter's end, and they ultimately clamped down on defense when it mattered most. Patrick Beverley's block of LeBron James' three-point attempt with 3.7 seconds left ultimately sealed the win, as the Lakers were forced to foul Paul George on the ensuing possession, which led to a pair of game-clinching free throws.

Kawhi Leonard led the way for the Clippers with 35 points, adding 12 rebounds, five assists and one steal. Montrezl Harrell furnished 18 points, six rebounds and one block. Paul George provided 17 points, five boards, three assists and three blocks. Ivica Zubac totaled 11 points, eight rebounds and one assist. Beverley supplied eight points, nine boards, four assists, one steal and his crucial block of James.

The Lakers were led by Kyle Kuzma, who contributed 25 points and complemented with four rebounds and one steal. Anthony Davis followed with 24 points, six rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. James finished with a 23-point, 10-assist double-double that also included nine rebounds, two steals and one block. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope poured in 13 points. 

The Clippers remain home to tangle with the Utah Jazz on Saturday night, while the Lakers pay a visit to the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday night as well.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 113-111, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Monday.

This game came down to the final shot, with Jamal Murray playing hero. In fact, he broke a tied game with 2.5 seconds left, hitting a step-back jumper to win the game. Devin Booker had a chance to re-take the lead at the buzzer with a three, but Jerami Grant blocked it. The Suns actually made a huge comeback in this game though, overcoming a 16-point deficit to lead for most of the fourth quarter. The key for Denver was their shooting, hitting 55 percent from the field and 54 percent from three-point range while holding Phoenix to 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from long range. 

The Nuggets (21-8) got a triple-double from Nikola Jokic, collecting 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Murray finished with 28 points, three rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Will Barton accrued 13 points, six rebounds, five assists and two steals while Paul Millsap amassed 10 points, eight rebounds and two assists.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 102-94, at Moda Center on Monday night.

The Pelicans (8-23) came into the contest with just three road wins and 14 losses in their previous 15 games, but they managed to set a positive tone early against the Trail Blazers (14-17). New Orleans matched Portland bucket for bucket in the first quarter on the way to a 31-31 deadlock, and they hung right with their hosts again in the second period to head into halftime with only a two-point deficit. The Pelicans then came out of intermission playing well on both ends of the floor, limiting the Blazers to just 38 points in the second half and putting up 48 of their own to clinch the road victory.

Jrue Holiday led the way for the Pelicans with 21 points, adding six rebounds, five assists and one steal. Brandon Ingram posted 19 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and two steals. J.J. Redick poured in 16 points and also furnished two rebounds and one assist. E'Twaun Moore provided 13 points off the bench, while Derrick Favors generated a 12-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included three assists, one steal and one block.

Carmelo Anthony overcame a questionable designation due to a knee issue to pace the Trail Blazers with 23 points, which he complemented with nine rebounds, two assists and one steal. C.J. McCollum delivered 20 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal. Damian Lillard totaled 18 points, seven assists, three rebounds and two steals. Hassan Whiteside contributed an 11-point, 16-rebound double-double.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 113-104, at Golden 1 Center on Monday night.

The Rockets (21-9) opened the game threatening a blowout, as they jumped out to a 37-21 lead through the first 12 minutes. The Kings (12-18) managed to shave eight points off their deficit during the second, but Houston's play in the third quarter, during which they added another 10 points to their advantage, essentially put the game away. The visitors enjoyed particularly large advantages in three-point shooting (38.5 percent-23.3 percent), but they lost the rebounding battle by a 49-40 margin.

James Harden led the Rockets with 34 points, adding five rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block. Russell Westbrook followed with 28 points, seven boards, six assists and one steal. Clint Capela generated a 15-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two blocks. Danuel House, Jr. delivered 14 points, while P.J. Tucker mustered five points but pulled down 11 boards.

De'Aaron Fox paced the Kings with 31 points and complemented them with nine rebounds, six assists and one steal. Richaun Holmes and Trevor Ariza contributed matching 12-point efforts while also pulling down 14 and six rebounds, respectively. Marvin Bagley III turned in 11 points and six boards, while Nemanja Bjelica posted 10 points.

The Rockets next pay a visit to the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday for a Christmas Day showdown, while the Kings remain home and take on the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday night.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 113-104, at Chase Center on Monday night.

The two spiraling squads matched each other bucket for bucket in the first quarter, before the Warriors (7-24) opened up a 14-point lead heading into halftime. Golden State managed to tack on another three points to its advantage during the third, but the Timberwolves (10-19) put a scare into their hosts in the fourth by getting as close as 95-89 with 5:02 remaining. Ultimately, Minnesota didn't quite have enough offensive firepower without Karl-Anthony Towns (knee), who missed his third straight game.

Andrew Wiggins led the way for the Timberwolves with 22 points, seven rebounds, two assists and one block. Jordan McLaughlin furnished 19 points, four assists, two rebounds and three steals. Jeff Teague supplied 12 points, four assists, one rebound and one block. Gorgui Dieng turned in 11 points, eight rebounds, one assist, three steals and one block.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 110-107, at Scotiabank Arena on Sunday.

The Raptors (21-8) delivered one of their best performances of the season as they erased a 30-point deficit to claim a huge home win over the Mavericks (19-10). Even though Dallas, who didn’t have their star player in Luka Doncic, led most of the game, the shorthanded Raptors managed to turn things around when it mattered the most. Toronto didn’t have Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell and Marc Gasol, but other players stepped things up. The biggest moment of the comeback came in the final quarter, as Dallas entered the final 12 minutes of action down by 23 points. However, a 47-21 score in the final quarter allowed Toronto to pull a huge win in front of their own crowd.

Kyle Lowry was the best player for the Raptors, as he finished the contest with 32 points (12-23 FG), 10 assists and eight rebounds, and Fred VanVleet scored 10 points while grabbing three rebounds but these two players were the only two to score in double digits from the starting unit. Chris Boucher had a solid performance off the bench since he had 21 points, seven rebounds, four blocks and two steals. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson finished with 18 points and nine rebounds in 29 minutes.

All five Mavericks in the starting lineup managed to score in double digits, but that didn’t happen with any bench player.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 119-93, at TD Garden on Sunday evening. 

The Celtics (20-7) may have suffered from a bit of overconfidence early, as the visiting Hornets (13-20) jumped out to a 37-30 first-quarter lead thanks to some efficient shooting. However, that initial scare seemed to wake Boston up, as the hosts erased their deficit altogether in the second and headed into halftime with a three-point edge. After tacking on another four points during the third period, the Celtics dominated on both ends of the floor over the final 12 minutes, outscoring Charlotte by a 35-16 margin in the fourth for the big home win.

Devonte' Graham paced the Hornets with 23 points, adding 10 assists and four rebounds. Bismack Biyombo followed with 18 points, three boards, two assists and two blocks. Miles Bridges turned in 15 points, six rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Terry Rozier tallied 14 points, four assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block against his former squad.

Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 39 points, supplementing them with 12 boards, two assists, three blocks and one steal. Kemba Walker furnished 23 points, four assists and one rebound. Jaylen Brown supplied 16 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Grant Williams mustered 12 points, four boards, two assists, one steal and one block.

The Hornets head back home to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night, while the Celtics pay a visit to the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday for a  Christmas Day showdown.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Orlando Magic, 118-103, at Moda Center on Friday night.

The Trail Blazers (13-16) came out of the gates playing stellar ball on both ends of the floor, as they jumped out to a 31-13 first-quarter lead. The Magic (12-17) were much more competitive from that point forward, actually outscoring Portland by a 90-87 margin over the final three quarters. However, that wasn't nearly enough to erase the significant hole they'd dug from themselves, with Orlando suffering its 11th home loss in fairly convincing fashion.

Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with a 23-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included an assist, six steals and two blocks. D.J. Augustin followed with a bench-leading 17 points. Evan Fournier poured in 16 points and added three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Aaron Gordon provided 11 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and one block. Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz generated matching 10-point tallies.

Damian Lillard paced the Trail Blazers with 36 points and also furnished six assists, three rebounds and one steal. C.J. McCollum totaled 31 points, eight rebounds, four assists and one steal. Kent Bazemore delivered 11 points, four boards, one steal and one block. Hassan Whiteside generated a 10-point, 17-rebound double-double that also included five blocks. 

The Magic head back home to take on the Chicago Bulls on Monday night, while the Trail Blazers remain home and tangle with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 111-104, at Fiserv Forum on Thursday night.

The Bucks (25-4) knew they had one of the biggest tests of the season in front of them in the form of the Lakers (24-5), which were getting Anthony Davis back from a one-game absence due to an ankle injury. However, Milwaukee set a dominant tone early, establishing a 23-17 lead after one quarter that had grown to 65-46 by halftime courtesy of a 42-point second period. While Los Angeles managed to shave 11 points from its deficit during the third quarter, the home squad hung tough in the final 12 minutes by essentially matching them bucket for bucket on the way to a tough home win.

Davis led the way for the Lakers with 36 points, adding 10 rebounds, five assists, three blocks and one steal. LeBron James followed with a 21-point, 12-rebound, 11-assist triple-double. Danny Green matched James' scoring and added four rebounds and a block. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope furnished 18 points, three assists, one rebound and one steal. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo paced the Bucks with a 34-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included seven assists, one steal and one block. George Hill delivered 21 points, three rebounds and one assist. Khris Middleton delivered 15 points, six boards and two assists. Wesley Matthews totaled 13 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block. Brook Lopez supplied 10 points, four rebounds, two assists, four steals and three blocks. 

The Lakers head back home to take on the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night, while the Bucks pay a visit to the New York Knicks on Saturday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the visiting Brooklyn Nets, 118-105, at AT&T Center on Thursday evening. 

The Nets got out to a great start on the road with an early 12-2 run and held on to take a six-point game by the end of the quarter. The Nets stayed in control and held a double-digit lead for much of the second, but the Spurs brought it back to a six-point game by halftime. The Nets stayed solid to start the third and held a 10-point lead with just over four minutes left in the quarter, but the Spurs closed the quarter on a 19-7 run, to take a two-point lead into the final frame. The Spurs pushed the momentum into the fourth and quickly built a nine-point lead. They stayed on top the rest of the way, while the Nets made it a two-point game with five minutes to go, the Spurs outscored the visitors by 11 points in the fourth quarter, to secure their eighth home win. 

Patty Mills led the Spurs with 27 points on 8-of-14 shooting, in 26 minutes off the bench. LaMarcus Aldridge totalled 20 points, 10 rebounds, two assists, four blocks and a steal, while Dejounte Murray and Derrick White chipped in 13 points each.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Los Angeles Clippers, 122-117, at Staples Center on Thursday. 
 
While there were nine lead changes in the first 15 minutes of this game, Los Angeles rode a 41-27 second quarter to a big halftime lead. Houston then responded with a 36-18 third quarter to take a three-point lead going into the fourth quarter. The Rockets started that fourth quarter on an 11-2 run but the Clippers responded with a 22-4 run of their own to take a six-point lead with five minutes remaining. Houston then scored 15 unanswered points with less than two minutes remaining and never gave up the lead from there. All of those runs ultimately led to 14 lead changes in this game. The key for Houston was their shooting, connecting on 50 percent of their shots. 

The Rockets (19-9) got a season-high from Russell Westbrook, who collected 40 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. James Harden tallied 28 points, 10 assists and two steals. Clint Capela totaled 16 points, eight rebounds and four steals while P.J. Tucker amassed 10 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks.

Patrick Beverley accrued 10 points, seven assists and four steals while Montrezl Harrell led the bench with 19 points and six boards. Beverley and Lou Williams were both ejected.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 100-98, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Wednesday evening.

The Cavaliers (7-21) were coming off a 1-2 road trip, and they used a strong first half to take care of a struggling Hornets (13-18) team that couldn’t complete a comeback in the second half. Cleveland went up 29-21 following the first quarter, and they extended their lead to 12 points following a 24-20 second quarter (53-41). Charlotte tried to mount a comeback and while the third quarter ended tied at 23-23, the Hornets went on a scoring run and won the final 12 minutes by a 10-point margin (34-24). That was not enough, however, and Cleveland secured the win. With the win, the Cavaliers improved to 4-10 at home while the Hornets fell to 6-10 on the road.

Collin Sexton was the best player for the Cavaliers, as he ended with 23 points while shooting 10-for-14 from the field. Cedi Osman had 18 points, while Kevin Love sniffed a triple-double after posting 16 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. Tristan Thompson added 14 points, 13 rebounds and two assists. Jordan Clarkson added 10 points off the bench.

Terry Rozier had perhaps his best game with the Hornets, as he ended with 35 points even though he needed 27 shots to reach that mark. Cody Zeller had 15 points with nine boards, while Marvin Williams had 10 points, four rebounds and four assists off the bench. One of the biggest disappointments was Devonte’ Graham, who ended with nine points and nine assists, but he made just three of his 16 shots from the field.

												The Boston Celtics take on the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center on Wednesday night.

The Mavericks (18-9) had already notched one impressive victory over an elite Eastern Conference opponent in the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night, and they got off to a good start in their quest for a second one by jumping out to a 55-50 halftime lead over the Celtics (18-7). However, the tide of the game changed in the third quarter, when Boston outscored Dallas by a 26-18 margin with strong play on both ends of the floor. The visitors ultimately made their advantage hold up, with a 12-7 run over the first 5:22 of the final period helping them to establish a solid cushion. Ryan Broekhoff helped the Mavs get as close as 107-103 with 20.3 seconds remaining with a pair of free throws, but Jaylen Brown sunk a pair of his own to seal the win.

Kemba Walker paced the Celtics with 32 points, adding five rebounds, three assists and one block. Brown finished with 26 points, nine boards, one block and one steal. Jayson Tatum delivered 24 points, eight rebounds, one assist and one block. 

Kristaps Porzingis led the Mavericks with a 23-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included two assists, three blocks and one steal. Seth Curry poured in 20 points and also offered four rebounds and two assists. Tim Hardaway managed 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and one steal. Jalen Bruson delivered a 10-point, 11-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 110-102, at Spectrum Center on Tuesday evening.

The Kings (12-15) entered this game coming off a win Sunday at Golden State, while the Hornets (13-17) were coming off a 2-1 road trip, so both teams carried some decent momentum going forward. Charlotte grabbed the lead early on, however, and they quickly jumped to a 26-21 lead following the first quarter. Charlotte also won the second quarter by a 27-26 score, but Sacramento didn't sit back and tried to flip the script with a 32-27 third quarter. The final 12 minutes were as tight as they could get since Charlotte entered the final frame with only a one-point lead, but the Hornets closed things out with a 30-23 score that didn't leave doubts. With the win, Charlotte moved to 7-8 at home while the Kings fell to 6-10 away from home.

Seven of nine Sacramento players scored in double digits, but De’Aaron Fox led the way with a strong 19-point, eight-assist performance in 30 minutes off the bench. Marvin Bagley III chipped in with 14 points and seven boards off the bench, while Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield each had 14 points. Nenad Bjelica contributed 12 points, five boards and three assists. Bogdan Bogdanovic had 10 points as well.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons, 133-119, at Little Caesars Arena on Monday evening.

The Wizards (8-17) entered this game having lost their first two games of a three-game road trip, but they bounced back here and secured a win over a Pistons (11-16) team that was unable to settle early on and paid a steep prize for their lack of concentration while missing their two best players in Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin. The Wizards quickly jumped to a 43-31 lead following the first quarter, and they would never lose that advantage. Even though the Pistons won the second and third quarters, 30-24 and 30-29 respectively, they still entered the final 12 minutes of action down by five points. Washington closed things out down the stretch, however, and a 37-28 lead in the final quarter was more than enough to win here. With the win, Washington improved to 4-11 on the road while the Pistons fell to 7-7 at home.

Bradley Beal was Washington’s top scoring threat since he ended with 35 points and 10 assists while shooting 12-24 from the field. Isaiah Thomas thrived as a starter, and he finished with 23 points and six dimes. Davis Bertans had another strong game off the bench, and ended with 17 points. Ish Smith had 10 points with seven assists, while Troy Brown Jr. had 10 points and six rebounds.

Markieff Morris and Derrick Rose led the way for the Pistons as both ended with 22 points, but the former MVP winner did it adding eight assists and six rebounds while coming off the bench. Bruce Brown had 20 points, and Luke Kennard had 14 points, six boards and six dimes. Tony Snell had 10 points and Christian Wood added 12 points as a substitute.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 109-107, at Toyota Center on Monday night.

The two teams had played an overtime thriller the first time they'd met this season, so competitive matchup was likely once again Monday. However, the first half was anything but, as the Spurs (10-16) jumped out to a 72-53 halftime lead. The Rockets (18-9) came out of intermission a different team, erasing all but six points from their deficit during the third quarter. The final period saw Houston go on an 18-8 run over the first 7:14 to take a 101-97 lead, and they ultimately sealed the victory courtesy of a pair of James Harden free throws with 16.2 seconds remaining. 

LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs with a 19-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included four assists, two blocks and one steal. Bryn Forbes poured in 18 points. Dejounte Murray and Derrick White produced matching 16-point, three-assist tallies while pulling down five and six rebounds, respectively. Rudy Gay and DeMar DeRozan compiled 12 points apiece, with Gay pulling down 12 rebounds as well.

Russell Westbrook paced the Rockets with 31 points, complementing them with 10 rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block. James Harden totaled 28 points, eight boards, seven assists, one steal and one block. Ben McLemore registered 17 points. Clint Capela delivered a 15-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included five assists, three blocks and one steal. P.J. Tucker mustered nine points and also pulled down 11 boards.

The Spurs return home and face off with the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night, while the Rockets pay a visit to the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night as well.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 120-116, at Fiserv Forum on Monday evening. 

Despite playing without their leading scorer, Luka Doncic, the Mavs got out to a great start on the road, with a 36-22 lead after one quarter. The Bucks responded in the second and outscored the visitors by 11 points in the quarter, to cut it to a three-point game by halftime. The Bucks took a brief lead early in the third but the Mavs rallied back ahead and held the lead for the final seven minutes of the quarter to take an 11-point lead into the fourth. The Mavs stayed in control to start the fourth and led by 15, with just over three minutes to go in the quarter. The Bucks would not go down without a fight, as they outscored the Mavs 21-10 the rest of the way, but ultimately fell short for their second home loss of the season and the end of their 18-game winning streak. 

Kristaps Porzingis led the Mavs with 26 points on 9-of-19 shooting, 12 rebounds, four assists and two blocks, in 32 minutes. Seth Curry tallied 26 points, five rebounds and four assists, while Dorian Finney-Smith finished with 15 points and eight rebounds.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Chicago Bulls, 109-106, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Monday night.

The Bulls (10-19) have proven far from an effective road team this season, but that was far from evident during a standout first quarter during which they outscored the Thunder (12-14) by a 37-16 margin. Oklahoma City was much better in the middle periods, however, shaving eight points off their original 21-point deficit going into the final quarter. They continued to progressively chip away at Chicago's advantage, and after the visitors had made a late comeback from a four-point deficit to knot the game at 106, OKC clinched the win with a trio of free throws by Steven Adams (one) and Chris Paul (two).

Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 39 points, adding three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Lauri Markkanen provided 13 points, three boards, one assist, two steals and two blocks. Wendell Carter, Jr. and Ryan Arcidiacono generated matching 12-point tallies, with Carter also pulling down nine rebounds. Tomas Satoransky furnished 11 points, six rebounds and six assists. 

Paul paced the Thunder with 30 points and complemented them with 10 rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Danilo Gallinari delivered 22 points, six boards, four assists and two steals. Dennis Schroder turned in 18 points, five assists, four rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Terrance Ferguson supplied 12 points, while Adams mustered nine points but also pulled down 11 rebounds. 

The Bulls remain on the road and face off with the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night, while the Thunder remain home and face the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 111-110, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Monday. 

While Phoenix held the lead for the entirety of the first half, this game came down to the final shot. In fact, Damian Lillard hit an and-one with 26 seconds left to turn a two-point deficit into a one-point lead. Ricky Rubio did have a chance to win at the buzzer but missed his three-pointer. That led to 10 lead changes in the second half alone, despite there being none in the first half. The Portland starters dominated, outscoring the Phoenix starters, 101-76. The Trail Blazers rim protection as critical, recording nine blocks to the Suns five.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 130-119, at Smoothie King Center on Sunday.

The Magic (12-14) have started their four-game road trip with a convincing win over a struggling Pelicans (6-21) franchise that has lost its last 12 games. Things appeared to be different in the early going, however, as the Pelicans raced to a 30-24 lead following the first quarter but couldn't hold on to their advantage afterwards. Orlando flipped the script with a 34-27 second quarter that put them up by one at half time, and they pulled away for good with a 41-27 score in the third quarter. New Orleans won the final 12 minutes of action with a 35-31 score, but it was too late and Orlando sealed the win with ease. With the win, Orlando improved to 4-8 on the road while the Pelicans fell to 4-10 at home.

Eight of Orlando’s nine players that saw action scored 10 or more points, with the lone exception being Aaron Gordon who finished with nine points. Jonathan Isaac led the way with a 21-point, 11-rebound performance, and Nikola Vucevic added 20 points in his first start after returning from injury. D.J. Augustin had 17 points off the bench, while Evan Fournier added 16 points.

Jrue Holiday was the best player for the Pelicans in this game, as he ended with 29 points, eight assists and four rebounds. J.J. Redick added 23 points with three dimes, and Brandon Ingram once again filled the stat sheet thanks to 21 points, six rebounds and six assists. Josh Hart was productive off the bench since he scored 20 points in 31 minutes. Josh Hayes had 10 points and seven rebounds.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic, 96-87, at Amway Center on Wednesday evening.

The Lakers (22-3) remain the best team in The Association this season and they were massive favorites ahead of this game, something they managed to back up against a struggling Magic (11-13) team that recently ended a four-game winning streak. The Lakers quickly jumped to a 26-9 lead in the first quarter and with such a big differential, they would never look back. Even though the Magic won both the second (29-25) and third (27-18) quarters, they were never in danger to even threaten Los Angeles’ lead. The Lakers were up by four points entering the final 12 minutes of action, but they didn’t have issues to close things out with a 27-22 win in the final quarter. With the win, the Lakers moved to 12-1 on the road while the Magic fell to 8-5 at home.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Toronto Raptors, 112-92, at Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday evening.

The Clippers (19-7) and the Raptors (16-8) played a game where the biggest news was the return of Kawhi Leonard to Toronto for the first time since delivering a title to the Canadian franchise last season. Toronto jumped ahead following a 32-27 lead in the first quarter, but they weren’t able to maintain the pace and the Clippers punished them in the second quarter with a 37-14 score. The Clippers didn’t look back, and Toronto was not able to turn things around. Even though the remaining two quarters were quite close (25-24 for Toronto and 24-21 for the Clippers, respectively) the game was out of reach by half time and Toronto didn’t have problems to win here with ease.

Seven Clippers scored in double digits here, but the main star was Kawhi Leonard who ended with 23 points, six assists, five rebounds and two steals. Moe Harkless had 14 points, and Paul George filled the stat sheet since he had 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Lou Williams looked dominant off the bench since he ended with 18 points, eight assists and six rebounds.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 127-112, at Fiserv Forum on Wednesday night.

That edge had climbed to 23 points by halftime, and although the Pelicans (6-19) played more competitively in the second half while putting up 66 points overall, Milwaukee was able to secure a comfortable home win.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 94-93, at Golden 1 Center on Wednesday night.

The back-and-forth battle fittingly started in see-saw fashion, with the Thunder (11-13) entering halftime with a 47-38 lead. However, the Kings (11-13) clawed back, shaving seven points from their deficit in the third quarter, and they finished the game on a 21-10 run over the final 7:34 to secure the comeback win. Bogdan Bogdanovic's 27-foot three-pointer with 17.3 seconds remaining ultimately proved to be the winning bucket, as Chris Paul's step-back jumper with 1.6 seconds left failed to find the net.

Dennis Schroder led the Thunder with 17 points, adding two rebounds, two steals and one block. Abdel Nader furnished 15 points, four boards and one steal. Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander generated matching 14-point tallies, with Gallinari adding eight rebounds. Steven Adams posted a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included four assists and two blocks. Nerlens Noel managed 11 points, four boards, two steals and one block, while Paul tallied eight points while also dishing out 12 assists and recording three blocks. 

Buddy Hield paced the Kings with 23 points, six rebounds, six assists and two steals. Bogdanovic finished with 17 points overall. Marvin Bagley III turned in 11 points and six rebounds in his return from a thumb fracture. Richaun Holmes and Nemanja Bjelica delivered 10 points apiece while pulling down seven and five rebounds, respectively.

The Thunder remain on the road and pay a visit to the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night, while the Kings remain home and await the New York Knicks for a Friday night matchup.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Golden State Warriors in overtime, 124-122, at Chase Center on Wednesday night.

A battle between two of the more defensively challenged squads in the league looked like a mismatch in the first half, with the Knicks (5-20) building a 68-50 halftime lead with the help of some highly efficient shooting. However, the Warriors (5-21) didn't surrender their question for only their second home win of the campaign, knocking 11 points off their deficit in the third quarter and ultimately forcing overtime with a D'Angelo Russell 23.-foot three-pointer with 5.5 seconds remaining. However, New York opened the extra period on a 9-2 run over the first 2:36, which gave them enough cushion for the narrow win.

Marcus Morris led the Knicks with 36 points, adding 10 rebounds, three assists and three steals. Julius Randle generated a 24-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included five assists. R.J. Barrett furnished 22 points, 10 boards, three assists, one steal and one block. Bobby Portis provided 15 points, three rebounds and two assists. Elfrid Payton delivered 14 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. 

Russell paced the Warriors with 32 points and also dished out six assists, posted three rebounds and recorded two steals. Alec Burks totaled 18 points, five boards, two assists and two steals. Glenn Robinson III managed 17 points, four boards, two assists and one steal. Draymond Green managed a 14-point, 12-assist, 10-rebound triple-double that also included four steals. Marquese Chriss contributed a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists, three blocks and one steal. 

The Knicks remain on their Western Conference swing and tangle with the Sacramento Kings on Friday night, while the Warriors hit the road and face off with the Utah Jazz on Friday night.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Washington Wizards, 114-106, at Spectrum Center on Tuesday evening.

The Hornets (10-16) and the Wizards (7-16) delivered a tighter-than-expected contest Tuesday, as this game was decided during the final seconds of the contest. The Hornets grabbed the lead first, however, and they jumped ahead by eight points (28-20) following the first quarter, but Washington closed the gap thanks to a 28-25 second quarter. The Hornets upped their lead by eight points after three quarters (82-75), and they would maintain it. Things got even tighter in the final quarters and at one point this game seemed destined for overtime, but Charlotte escaped from the Wizards’ comeback to end with the win. As a result, Charlotte improved to 6-8 at home while Washington fell to 3-10 on the road.

Six of nine Charlotte players reached double figures, but the main scoring presence was Devonte Graham as he finished with 29 points, six assists and two steals. Terry Rozier bounced back from an ugly game the last time out and filled the stat sheet thanks to 17 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Miles Bridges had 16 points, and Bismack Biyombo pulled a strong double-double of 13 points and 15 boards. Cody Zeller had 14 points with 10 boards off the bench.

Four Wizards players scored in double figures, but the main star was Bradley Beal since he finished with 16 points, nine assists and four rebounds. Davis Bertans had some good moments coming off the bench, and he finished with a game-high 32 points while making eight of 12 shots from three-point range. Rui Hachimura had a double-double of 18 points and 12 rebounds.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Denver Nuggets, 97-92, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday night.

A matchup between two very evenly matched teams was fittingly close from the opening tip, with the 76ers (18-7) erasing a slim one-point deficit at the end of one quarter to take a five-point lead into halftime over the Nuggets (14-8). Philadelphia managed to add another two points to its advantage in the third period and saw Denver get as close as 95-92 with 18.9 seconds remaining before closing out the win with a pair of Joel Embiid free throws.

Will Barton paced the Nuggets with 26 points, adding seven rebounds, seven assists, three blocks and two steals. Nikola Jokic generated a 15-point, 11-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds and one block. Gary Harris turned in 14 points, five assists, two rebounds and two steals. Paul Millsap furnished 10 points, six boards, three steals and one block. Jamal Murray played only five minutes before suffering a trunk contusion that led to an early exit.

Embiid led the 76ers with 22 points and complemented them with 10 boards, six assists, two steals and one block.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Atlanta Hawks in overtime, 135-121, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday night.

Despite the disparity in the teams' records, the Hawks (6-18) and Heat (18-6) put on an instant classic, with two of the fastest-paced teams in the league fittingly lighting up the scoreboard. After Miami established a 36-30 lead through one, Atlanta outscored its hosts by a 66-57 margin in the middle periods to take a three-point lead into the fourth quarter. The Heat was eventually down by a 107-101 score with 7:06 remaining before finishing regulation on a 16-10 run that culminated in a Jimmy Butler three-pointer that knotted the score at 117-117 and helped lead overtime. Miami then opened the extra period with 16 straight points to seal the hard-fought victory.

De'Andre Hunter paced the Hawks with 28 points, adding four rebounds, three assists and one block. Trae Young followed with 21 points, nine assists and four boards. Jabari Parker managed 16 points, seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Cam Reddish furnished 14 points, eight boards and one assist. Vince Carter contributed 12 points four assists and three rebounds. 

Kendrick Nunn led the Heat with 36 points and complemented them with six rebounds, four assists and one steal. Duncan Robinson followed with a career-high 34 points, supplementing them with four assists, three rebounds and one block. Bam Adebayo generated a 30-point, 11-rebound, 11-assist triple-double. Butler totaled 20 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists. 

The Hawks remain on the road and tangle with the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night, while the Heat remains home and faces the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 110-99, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday evening.

The Clippers (18-7) didn't have Kawhi Leonard (knee) available for this game, but apparently his absence didn't have much of a factor in this contest since the Pacers (15-9) couldn't find a way to stop Paul George. The Clippers started this game with a bang, and quickly jumped to a 24-19 lead following the first quarter. They pulled away for good in the second quarter (36-29) and further extended their advantage in the third quarter (31-25), essentially icing the game out by the time the final 12 minutes arrived. Even though Indiana won the final quarter by a 26-19 score, that was garbage time and the Clippers eased their way towards a solid win away from home. With the win, the Clippers improved to 5-6 away from home while the Pacers fell to 9-3 at home.

Despite Kawhi Leonard’s absence, Paul George led the way for the Clippers, and he delivered an impressive performance with 36 points, nine rebounds, five assists and two steals. Ivica Zubac chipped in with 13 points and eight boards, while Patrick Beverley filled the stat sheet thanks to 11 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and three steals. Montrezl Harrell had 26 points and eight rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. Lou Williams struggled in his usual substitute role, finishing with six points in 33 minutes but shooting 2-for-19 from the field.

Domantas Sabonis had another strong night on the glass, and he finished with 22 rebounds as well as 18 points. Malcolm Brogdon chipped in with 20 points and two assists. T.J. Warren and Jeremy Lamb each had 12 points. Doug McDermott had 17 points.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 110-88, at TD Garden on Monday evening.

The Celtics (17-5) ended their three-game home stand on a strong note, as they didn't have major problems to secure a double-digit win over a lowly Cavaliers (5-18) team. Boston quickly jumped to a 29-18 lead in the first quarter, and they would never looked back since Brad Stevens' men won every single quarter separatedly. Boston extended their lead following a 24-22 score in the second quarter, and things didn't change in the second half. The Celtics won the third quarter 30-26, and they would end the game with a 27-22 fourth-quarter score. The Cavaliers didn't have a single shot at turning things around, and Boston cruised their way to a solid win. With the win, Boston moved to 10-0 at home while the Cavaliers fell to 2-9 on the road.

All five starters for the Celtics scored in double digits, and all 12 players to step on the hardwood scored at least two points for Boston. Kemba Walker led the way with 22 points and seven assists, while Jaylen Brown chipped in with 20 points and seven rebounds. Jayson Tatum had 19 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, two blocks and two steals. Gordon Hayward scored 14 points in his return, while Daniel Theis chipped in with 10 points.

Tristan Thompson was Cleveland’s most productive player in this game, as he ended with 17 points and 11 rebounds in 36 minutes of action. Kevin Love only had seven points (3-12 from the field) but he contributed 10 rebounds. Collin Sexton (eight points) and Darius Garland (nine points) struggled. Jordan Clarkson had 19 points off the bench.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 93-92, at United Center on Monday.

All four quarters were decided by two points or fewer, as that exemplifies just how close this game was. In fact, there were 11 ties and 14 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than eight points.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Utah Jazz, 104-90, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday.

It's rare to see Utah dominated at home but that was just the case here. In fact, Oklahoma City won each of the first three quarters, riding a 34-21 third quarter to their blowout win. In fact, Utah never got the game within a single-digit margin from there. The key for the Thunder was their defense, holding Utah to 40 percent from the field and 26 percent from three-point range. The seven blocks recorded by Oklahoma City were big too, with Utah failing to record a single one. 

The Thunder (11-12) were led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who tallied 20 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets, 105-102, at Barclays Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Nets (13-10) and the Nuggets (14-7) engaged in quite a battle in Sunday's early game, as things were back-and-forth until the very last play of regulation. Brooklyn jumped to a 25-21 lead in the first quarter, but Denver erased it an grabbed a one-point lead at the break following a 33-28 second quarter score. The Nets were once again on top following the third quarter following a 29-23 score over that 12-minute span, and as a result, they were up by one point entering the final quarter of the contest. Denver and Brooklyn traded buckets in the final quarter, but the Nets came through when it mattered the most. Will Barton missed a floater when Denver was down by one and, after a foul, Taurean Prince made two clutch free throws to put the Nets up by three. A last-second three-pointer from Jamal Murray went wide off the mark, and the Nets sealed a huge win in front of their fans. With the win, Brooklyn moved to 7-4 at home while the Nuggets fell to 6-4 on the road.

Spencer Dinwiddie was BrooklynaÂ™s top scorer since he finished with 24 points and eight assists. Jarrett Allen had 19 points and 11 rebounds, while Garrett Temple contributed 15 points, six rebounds and three dimes. Joe Harris chipped in with 13 points. Taurean Prince only had nine points, but he added 11 rebounds and four assists. All five starters featured for at least 30 minutes, while no bench player reached the 20-minute mark of playing time.

Nikola Jokic was the best player for the Nuggets, and he delivered his second strong effort on a row, as he ended with 24 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Jamal Murray finished with 21 points despite shooting 7-from-17 from the field. Gary Harris had another game to forget, and only had nine points while making just three of his 10 field-goal attempts. Jerami Grant added 15 points coming off the bench.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 122-107, at Spectrum Center on Sunday evening.

The Hawks (6-17) entered this game having lost 11 of their last 12 games, but they turned things around with a solid performance as they didn't give the Hornets (9-16) a single chance to get back into the game once they reached top gear. Charlotte started the game stronger, however, and they jumped to a 27-24 lead in the first quarter. Atlanta would win the second quarter 27-26 to make it a two-point deficit, but that would be a sign of things to come after the break. The Hawks won the third quarter 37-30, and the fourth one by an even more expressive 34-24, as they put the game out of reach in the final 24 minutes of action. With the win, Atlanta improved to 3-9 on the road while the Hornets fell to 5-8 at home.

Trae Young was one of the best players for Atlanta since he finished with 30 points, nine assists and six rebounds, but he struggled from the field since he made just nine of his 20 field-goal attempts. Jabari Parker delivered a strong effort and ended with 19 points and seven boards. Most of the damage was done by substitutes, however, as four Hawks scored 10-plus points while coming off the bench. These were Vince Carter (17 points), Alex Len (13 points, 10 rebounds), Allen Crabbe (11 points) and DeAndre Hunter (10 points).

P.J. Washington and Miles Bridges led the way for the Hornets, as both ended with 20 points each. Devonte Graham filled the stat sheet nicely since he ended with 12 points, eight assists, six rebounds and two steals. Bismack Biyombo and Cody Zeller had 11 points each. Terry Rozier struggled, and only scored eight points while shooting 3-13 from the field.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Chicago Bulls in overtime, 110-105, at American Airlines Arena on Sunday evening.

The Heat (17-6) came into the contest trying to preserve an unblemished home record, but the Bulls (8-16) started very strong on both ends of the floor. After taking a 25-16 lead through one, Chicago lost all but two points of their advantage during the second period. The two squads then played a spirited second half, and Zach LaVine's two free throws with 2.8 seconds remaining pushed the game into overtime. In the extra period, Tyler Herro's go-ahead three-pointer with 38.2 seconds remaining snapped a 105-105 tie and gave Miami a lead for good.

Lauri Markkanen paced the Bulls with 22 points, adding seven rebounds, two assists and one steal. LaVine provided 18 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. Kris Dunn delivered 16 points, five boards, two assists and three steals. Thaddeus Young registered 12 points and four boards. Coby White and Denzel Valentine had 11 points apiece, with White adding eight assists and four rebounds.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 126-112, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday night.

The Grizzlies (6-16) knew they were overmatched on paper in a road tilt against the Jazz (13-10), but they came swinging out of the gate and built a 36-32 lead after 12 minutes.

Jaren Jackson, Jr. paced the Grizzlies with 26 points, adding four rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Jae Crowder and Grayson Allen followed with matching 13-point, two-rebound tallies. Jonas Valanciunas and Dillon Brooks produced 10 points apiece, with Valanciunas also pulling down six boards.

The visitors were able to turn the tables on Cleveland in the fourth, outscoring their hosts by a 25-17 margin in the final 12 minutes to notch the road victory.

Terrance Ross led the Magic with 21 points, adding three rebounds, one assist and one steal. Evan Fournier registered 18 points, two rebounds, two assists and one block. Aaron Gordon delivered 14 points, five boards, two assists, one steal and one block. D.J. Augustin checked in with 10 points, seven assists, three rebounds and three steals.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 119-113, at Verizon Center on Thursday.

The Wizards (8-13) and the 76ers (15-8) ended delivering a thrilling, exciting contest between two teams that are currently riding opposite runs of form. While the Wizards are one of the rebuilding sides in the Eastern Conference, the Sixers are bonafide title candidates in the same Conference. Such wasn't the case here, though, as Washington bounced back from an ugly first quarter (25-33) with a stellar second quarter score of 40-22. The third quarter ended in a 26-26 draw, so Philly had one last chance to complete the comeback in the final minutes. But Washington held on, and secured a big win against a Conference rival. With the win, Washington moved to 4-5 at home while Philadelphia fell to 5-8 on the road.

Rookie Rui Hachimura was the top scorer for the Wizards since he ended with 27 points, seven rebounds and two steals. Bradley Beal chipped in with a strong double-double, as he ended with 26 points, 10 rebounds and four dimes. Ish Smith, who started due to Isaiah Thomas' injury woes, ended with 19 points and eight assists. Davis Bertans had a great performance off the bench since he contributed 26 points in 37 minutes whle coming off the bench.

Tobias Harris scored a game-high 33 points, but he also added seven rebounds and three assists. Joel Embiid had a strong double-double since he ended with 26 points and 21 rebounds. Ben Simmnons had 17 points with 10 assists and five rebounds. Al Horford cooperated with 11 points too. Veteran guard Raul Neto scored 11 points.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Golden State Warriors, 106-91, at Spectrum Center on Wednesday.

The Hornets (9-14) were favorites ahead of this contest against the Warriors (4-19) – something that would have been unthinkable one season ago – and they delivered here, as they were in complete control of the contest practically from start to finish. Charlotte quickly jumped to a 28-20 lead in the first quarter, but the Warriors shortened the gap in the second quarter (34-30) so the Hornets had a four-point lead entering the half time break. The Hornets pulled away for good in the third quarter with a 28-22 lead, and they ended closing things out with a 20-15 fourth quarter. With the win, Charlotte moved to 5-6 at home while the Warriors fell to 2-12 on the road.

In addition, the Bucks went 25-of-27 from the free-throw line while the Pistons hit just 14-of-22. Milwaukee also won the rebounding battle, 55-40. 

The Bucks (19-3) were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who tallied 35 points, nine rebounds and two blocks. Khris Middleton accrued 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Eric Bledsoe totaled 13 points, six rebounds and six assists while Brook Lopez totaled five points, six boards and three blocks.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 130-118, at State Farm Arena on Wednesday night.

The downtrodden Hawks (5-17) got the game off on the right foot, taking a 26-22 lead through the first 12 minutes. However, the Nets (11-10) managed to erase that deficit and build a nine-point lead going into halftime courtesy of a 34-point second quarter. They then matched Atlanta's intensity coming out of intermission, playing to a 35-35 deadlock in the third period before putting up another 39 points in the fourth for the final 12-point margin of victory.

Taurean Prince touched up his old squad for 23 points, six boards, four assists and two steals.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Miami Heat, 112-93, at TD Garden on Wednesday.

The Celtics (15-5) have been one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference this season, but the Heat (15-6) could fall in the same category as well so this game was expected to be quite tight. Such wasn’t the case, though, as the Celtics dominated the entire contest and didn’t have problems to cruise their way towards a comfortable victory. Things didn’t start well for Boston, however, as Miami jumped to a 28-20 lead following the first quarter. The Celtics turned things around quickly after the break, though, with a 32-16 second quarter that pulled them away for good. Boston won the remaining two quarters as well, 30-25 and 30-24 respectively, and ended sealing the win quite comfortably. With the win, the Celtics remain perfect at home with an 8-0 mark while the Heat fell to 7-6 on the road.

Jaylen Brown was the best scorer for the Celtics since he ended with 31 points and four rebounds, but Kemba Walker came quite close with a 28-point performance. The star point guard also added seven assists, four rebounds and two steals. Jayson Tatum had 19 points, five rebounds and three assists. No other Boston reached the 10-point mark, but every player excepting Javonte Green scored at least two points.

Jimmy Butler scored a game-high 37 points, but his scoring outputs didn’t help Miami to get a win; the All-Star forward chipped in with six rebounds, four assists and two steals as well. Duncan Robinson had 10 points, five rebounds and three steals. Kelly Olynyk (12 points, four boards) and Justise Winslow (10 points, seven rebounds) looked impressive despite the fact they came off the bench.

The Bulls would manage to finish on an 18-12 run from that point forward, with Zach LaVine scoring seven of his squad's next 10 points to help regain separation.

Jonas Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with 32 points and added 13 rebounds, one assist, three steals and one block. Jaren Jackson, Jr. and Jae Crowder had matching 15-point tallies while pulling down seven and six rebounds, respectively. Grayson Allen supplied 12 points, seven boards, one assist and one steal.

Detroit jumped to a 32-28 lead in the first quarter and it seemed things would be tight early on, but the Pistons pulled away for good with a 30-18 second quarter, and a 35-22 third quarter. By that point, the game was over and the Pistons had sent most of their bench players to the floor on garbage time, but it didn't seem to matter. Detroit won the final 12 minutes of action by a 30-26 score, and on the process they clinched one of their biggest wins of the season. With the win, Detroit moved to 2-9 on the road, while Cleveland fell to 3-8 at home.

Blake Griffin was Detroit's top scorer with 24 points and four rebounds; he was one of six Pistons to score in double digits here. Andre Drummond filled the stat sheet admirably since he finished the game with 17 points, 14 rebounds, five steals, four assists and four blocks. Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk ended with 15 points, Derrick Rose came close to a double-double with 12 points and nine dimes, and Langston Galloway had 14 points. Markieff Morris had 12 points as well.

Collin Sexton was the top scoring threat for the Cavaliers since he ended with 22 points, but he was the only Cleveland player who ended with more than 15 points. Cedi Osman and Tristan Thompson had 10 points each, and they were the only two starters who scored in double digits. Jordan Clarkson (10 points) and Kevin Porter Jr. (12 points) had decent efforts off the bench.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards, 127-120, at Capital One Arena on Tuesday night.

The Magic (9-11) were on a negative run of results before this contest, but they certainly bounced back with a strong effort against a Wizards (6-13) team that keeps piling losses night after night. Orlando quickly jumped ahead after a 32-26 first quarter, and they extended that advantage with a 36-28 second quarter that put them on the driving seat for good. Washington tried to turn things around in the second half, but their efforts were not enough. They won the remaining two quarters, 34-29 and 32-30 respectively, but the Magic held on and secured a huge victory on the road. With the win, Orlando moved to 2-7 on the road while the Wizards fell to 3-5 at home.

Six of Orlando’s eight players scored in double digits here. Evan Fournier led the way with 31 points, while Aaron Gordon had a double-double since he ended with 18 points and 11 boards. Jonathan Isaac had 11 points with six boards, and Markelle Fultz chipped in with 20 points, six assists, three rebounds and two steals. D.J. Augustin impressed with 24 points off the bench, and Terrence Ross added 14 as a substitute.

Bradley Beal had 42 points, six rebounds and four assists, but those impressive numbers weren’t enough to lead Washington to a win. Isaiah Thomas had 20 points with seven assists, while Davis Bertans had 21 points in a spot start. Rui Hachimura added 15 points with six rebounds and four assists. Jordan McRae chipped in with 10 points coming off the bench.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 118-97, at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Houston Rockets, 135-133, in double overtime at AT & T Center on Tuesday night.

The in-state rivals engaged in a regular-season classic, but the game actually was in danger of slipping away from the Spurs (8-14) after a competitive first quarter. The Rockets (13-7) outscored San Antonio by a 72-54 margin during the middle periods to take a 16-point lead into the fourth quarter. The home squad would then outpace their visitors by a 34-18 margin over the final 12 minutes to force the first overtime, and an offensive charge call on James Harden, who scored 50 points with the help of a record 24-for-24 tally from the free-throw line, with 0.8 seconds left sealed the win for the Spurs.

Harden added nine rebounds, six assists and four steals to his game-high scoring total. Clint Capela followed with a 22-point, 21-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two blocks and one steal. Russell Westbrook generated a 19-point, 10-rebound, 10-assist triple-double that included two steals and one block. Austin Rivers matched Westbrook's scoring total and also pulled down four boards. Ben McLemore poured in 11 points, while P.J. Tucker stuffed the stat sheet with 10 points, nine rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks, 132-88, at Fiserv Forum on Monday night.

The Bucks (18-3) were sizable favorites coming into the contest for a number of obvious reasons, but there was never a feeling they took the floor with too much confidence. That's because Milwaukee quickly established a 33-15 lead over the Knicks (4-17) through the first 12 minutes and owned a 72-45 edge by halftime. The second half was essentially more of the same, and the hosts finished the contest with 55.8 percent shooting, including 45.7 percent from three-point range.

Julius Randle led the way for the Knicks with 19 points, adding five rebounds, one assist and one steal. Dewayne Dotson added 15 off the bench. Allonzo Trier compiled 10 points, one rebound and one assist. No other New York player scored in double digits, although Taj Gibson was able to add nine rebounds to his seven points. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo paced the Bucks with a 29-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included three assists. D.J. Wilson totaled 19 points and five boards, Khris Middleton reentered the starting lineup and supplied 16 points, seven rebounds, three assists and one steal. George Hill provided 14 points and four assists, while Donte DiVincenzo poured in 11 points. 

The Knicks head back home to face the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night, while the Bucks pay a visit to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.

While Sacramento led for the entirety of the first quarter, that was the only lead they had. In fact, Chicago rode a 33-21 second quarter to a big lead and never surrendered it in the second half.

The Bulls (7-14) were led by Zach LaVine, as he tallied 28 points, one rebound and three assists. Lauri Markkanen amassed 20 points and seven boards while Wendell Carter totaled 10 points, 10 rebounds and two steals.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 109-106, at Barclays Center on Sunday.

The Heat (14-5) and the Nets (10-10) played a thrilling encounter between two aspiring, on-the-rise teams in the Eastern Conference and as such, things were decided down the stretch and in the final seconds of the contest. Miami grabbed a two-point lead following a 32-30 first quarter, but the Nets turned things around and went ahead at the break by seven points following a 35-26 second quarter. Miami, however, flipped the script once again in the third quarter and won that 12-minute period by nine points (25-16), meaning they were up two points entering the final 12 minutes of action. Brooklyn fought hard and even had the lead late on the game, but Miami sealed the deal and ended winning deservedly. With the win, Miami improved to 6-5 away from home while the Nets fell to 6-4 at home.

Despite coming off the bench, Goran Dragic was the best player for the Heat since he ended with 24 points and six assists in 31 minutes of action. Jimmy Butler filled the stat sheet admirably and aside from scoring 20 points, he also added seven rebounds and two assists. Bam Adebayo had 17 points with 16 rebounds, while Duncan Robinson had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Kendrick Nunn added 11 points in 25 minutes.

Spencer Dinwiddie had a great performance for the Nets once again, and he ended with 29 points, six rebounds, four assists and one steal. Joe Harris also contributed 25 points after going 5-9 from three-point range. DeAndre Jordan had 15 points, eight rebounds and two assists as a substitute. David Nwaba added 10 points in 18 minutes coming off the bench.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the New York Knicks, 113-104, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon. 

The Celtics (14-5) may have come into the contest with a bit of overconfidence against the lowly Knicks (4-16), but they had to battle to forge a 58-58 halftime tie. Boston then actually fell behind by four points during the third before mounting a furious comeback in the final period that consisted of a 32-point outburst. Both teams shot well, but the visitors outpaced New York, 36.6 percent-30.8 percent, from three-point range.

Jayson Tatum led the way for the Celtics with 30 points, adding seven assists, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Jaylen Brown poured in 28 points and complemented them with five rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Kemba Walker generated a 16-point, 10-assist double-double that also included five rebounds and one steal. Enes Kanter and Brad Wanamaker posted matching 11-point tallies, with Kanter also pulling down 11 boards.

Julius Randle paced the Knicks with 26 points and supplemented them with five rebounds and two assists. Dennis Smith, Jr. followed with 17 points, seven assists, one rebound and two blocks. R.J. Barrett furnished 16 points, seven boards, one steal and one block. Kevin Knox contributed 11 points, five rebounds and two blocks.

The Celtics head back home to visit the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, while the Knicks pay a visit to the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 115-107, at Target Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Grizzlies (6-13) entered this game on a six-game losing streak and without star point guard Ja Morant on their roster due to a back injury, but they defied the odds and won a tough away matchup against the Timberwolves (10-9). The game was quite tight, however, but Memphis grabbed the lead following the first quarter with a 25-21 score. Minnesota made things close in the second quarter, and the first 24 minutes of action ended with a one-point lead for the visitors (48-47).

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 114-100, at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Mavericks (13-6) have been providing glimpses of their legitimate improvement throughout the early portion of the season, but the test they faced against the Lakers (17-3) on Sunday shaped up as their stiffest yet, especially considering the 10-game winning streak Los Angeles walked into the contest with. Dallas hung tough in the first half trailing by just three points at intermission. However, it was the third quarter that changed the entire dynamic of the contest with Dallas outscoring Los Angeles by a 35-17 margin during the period to establish a lead it wouldn't relinquish. 

Luka Doncic led the way for the Mavericks with 27 points, adding 10 assists, nine rebounds and three steals. Delon Wright supplied 17 points, nine assists, five boards and four steals. Dwight Powell, Kristaps Porzingis and Justin Jackson each posted 15 points, with Powell and Porzingis pulling down nine and six rebounds, respectively. 

Anthony Davis paced the Lakers with a 27-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two blocks and one steal. LeBron James delivered 25 points, nine rebounds, eight assists and four steals. Alex Caruso led the bench with 10 points and also pulled down four boards. Danny Green poured in eight points, while JaVale McGee registered just four points but also recorded 10 rebounds.

The Mavericks remain on the road and next visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night, while the Lakers pay a visit to the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night as well.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Boston Celtics, 112-107, at Barclays Center on Friday afternoon.

The Nets (10-9) were looking for a bit of redemption and hoping to make a statement against one of the elite in their division in the Celtics (13-5), which had just toppled them Wednesday night. Brooklyn got off to an excellent start in that regard, establishing a 31-24 lead through one quarter before seeing Boston whittle down that advantage to four points by halftime. After the home squad managed to extend the edge back out to seven in the third, their 13-4 run during the first half of the final period helped establish more separation, and misses by Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown in one sequence during the final six seconds sealed the victory for the Nets.

Jayson Tatum led the way for the Celtics with 26 points, adding nine rebounds and four steals. Walker provided 17 points, six assists and five rebounds. Smart followed with 15 points, two rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Brad Wanamaker paced the bench with 11 points, eight boards, three assists and one block. Enes Kanter contributed 10 points, six rebounds, one assist and one block.

Spencer Dinwiddie paced the Nets with 32 points, supplementing them with 11 assists, five rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Taurean Prince delivered 16 points, four boards and one assist. Jarrett Allen generated a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one assist, one steal and one block. Joe Harris and Garrett Temple pitched in matching 12-point efforts, with Harris adding six rebounds, four assists and two steals and Temple dishing out seven dimes and pulling down five boards.

The Celtics remain in the Big Apple and tangle with the New York Knicks on Sunday afternoon, while the Nets will remain at home and tangle with the Miami Heat on Sunday afternoon.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the New York Knicks, 126-98, at Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday evening.

These two teams started this game on opposite spectrums – while the Raptors are one of the best franchises in the league and the reigning NBA champions, the Knicks have been struggling once again and they already seem like lottery candidates just one month into the season. However, those differences were not noticeable, and the Knicks jumped ahead to a 29-21 lead following the first quarter. Toronto flipped the script in the second quarter, however, and they grabbed the lead at half time following a 37-17 second quarter. Toronto also won the other two quarters, 31-23 and 37-29 respectively, as they ended winning by an impressive 28-point margin that reflects better the gulf of difference between both franchises.

Pascal Siakam was the best player for the Raptors in this game since he finished with 31 points, eight rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes. Fred VanVleet had 15 points and OG Anunoby added 13 points with 12 rebounds. The biggest contributions came from the bench, though. Chris Boucher (13 points, 12 rebounds), Terence Davis (15 points, five assists, four rebounds), Malcolm Miller (13 points) and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (12 points) scored in double digits off the bench.

Julius Randle was the best player for the Knicks since he ended with 19 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes of action. R.J. Barrett had 16 points with five boards, four assists and three steals. Alonzo Trier scored 10 points off the bench. No other Knicks players reached 10 or more points.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Houston Rockets, 137-123, at Toyota Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Mavericks (11-5) entered this game on a four-game winning streak and led by an early MVP candidate in Luka Doncic, but they faced a tough test in Houston since the Rockets (11-6) had also been one of the best teams in the Western Conference so far. But the Mavericks didn't want surprises here and quickly jumped to a 45-29 lead in the first quarter; that would set the tone for the rest of the game. Dallas also won the second quarter 33-31 and, due to Dallas' impressive lead at the break, it seemed as if the game was all but over. Houston bounced back with a 35-27 third quarter, but Dallas closed things out with a 32-28 fourth-quarter score. Dallas was just too much for the Rockets, and fully deserved the win here. With the win, Dallas moved to 5-2 on the road while Houston fell to 6-2 at home.

Luka Doncic had another stellar performance since he finished with 41 points, 10 assists, six rebounds, two steals and one block. Kristaps Porzingis added 23 points, 13 rebounds, three assists and two steals. Tim Hardaway Jr. had 31 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Dorian Finney-Smith chipped in with 12 points and 10 boards. Maxi Kleber added 11 points off the bench.

Tucker and Danuel House Jr. each had 16 points, while the bench combined for 11 total points on 5-of-16 shooting.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Miami Heat, 113-86, at Wells Fargo Arena on Saturday night.

After a blazing hot start to the season that virtually no one outside their locker room likely saw coming, perhaps the Heat (11-4) was due for a clunker. Miami managed just 13 points in the first quarter while allowing the 76ers (11-5) to tally 28, setting the stage for what turned out to be a lopsided loss. The visitors did play much more competitively the rest of the way, but they had no answer for Philadelphia, which shot 50.6 percent, including 48.3 percent from three-point range.

Tyler Herro led the Heat with 20 points, adding two rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Goran Dragic followed with 18 points, three rebounds and one assist. Bam Adebayo delivered 12 points and five boards. Jimmy Butler totaled 11 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals in his Philadelphia return. Chris Silva managed 10 points, six boards, three assists, one steal and one block.

Josh Richardson paced the 76ers with 32 points, complementing them with four assists, one rebound and one steal. Joel Embiid generated a 23-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two steals and two blocks. Tobias Harris managed 19 points, eight boards, two assists and two steals. Al Horford provided 16 points, six rebounds and three assists.

The Heat returns home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night, while the 76ers travel to face the Toronto Raptors on Monday night as well.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 138-132, at Verizon Center on Wednesday. 

The Wizards (4-8) didn't enter this game on a good run of form, but Washington managed to secure a positive result against a struggling Spurs (5-9) team that now has seven straight losses for the first time before the Tim Duncan era. This game was extremely tight, though. The Spurs jumped to a 38-35 lead in the first quarter, and they extended their lead to six points at the break thanks to a 31-28 second quarter. However, the Wizards turned things around after half time.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 101-91, at Barclays Center on Wednesday night.

Although the visitors would get as close as 86-83 with 6:28 remaining, the Nets would finish them off with a 15-8 run to close out the contest.

Terry Rozier paced the Hornets with 18 points, adding six rebounds and two assists. Devonte' Graham followed with 17 points, six assists, three rebounds and one block. Malik Monk led the second unit with 13 points and added three rebounds, one assist and two steals. Miles Bridges registered 12 points, five five rebounds, two steals and one block.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Orlando Magic, 113-97, at Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday night.

The two squads engaged in a highly competitive first quarter, matching each other bucket for bucket on the way to a 32-32 deadlock.

Evan Fournier led the way for the Magic with 21 points, adding three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Jonathan Isaac supplied a 16-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included three assists, three blocks and one steal. Terrance Ross led the bench with 14 points. Markelle Fultz and Khem Birch provided matching 12-point tallies while recording four assists and four rebounds, respectively.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 114-95, at FedEx Forum on Tuesday night.

The Warriors (3-12) came into the contest in desperate need of a win but operating with the makeshift crew that's a byproduct of multiple injuries. The Grizzlies (5-9) outpaced Golden State by a bucket in the first quarter, yet the visitors' 33-point tally in the second erased their slim deficit and left them with a 15-point advantage heading into intermission. While Memphis got four points closer during the third, the Warriors were able to roar back with a 31-point fourth quarter to secure the much-needed road win. 

Alec Burks led the way for the Warriors with 29 points, adding eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Glen Robinson III turned in 20 points, two assists and one rebound. Eric Paschall and Marquese Chriss generated matching 17-point tallies while pulling down five and six rebounds, respectively. Draymond Green stuffed the stat sheet with eight points, 11 assists, 10 rebounds and two blocks.

Ja Morant paced the Grizzlies with 20 points, complementing them with six assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Dillon Brooks produced 18 points, three rebounds, two steals and one block. Brandon Clarke provided 17 points, five rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Jae Crowder furnished a 15-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included four assists.

The Warriors remain on the road and tangle with the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night, while the Grizzlies remain home and take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 115-104, at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday night.

The Pelicans (5-9) got off to a slow start since the Blazers (5-9) jumped ahead on the score rather quickly, but New Orleans used a strong effort during the second half to get the win here. Portland was up 28-27 after the first quarter, and they maintained that one-point advantage heading into the break (54-53). However, New Orleans woke up in the second half, and had no problems to recover the advantage thanks to an impressive performance during the third quarter, where they flipped the script and put themselves up by nine points (88-79). The Pelicans also won the final quarter by just two points, and that gave them a double-digit win in front of their fans.

Brandon Ingram returned from injury, and he thrived thanks to his 21 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two steals. Jrue Holiday was New Orleans’ top scoring threat, however, as he finished with a double-double of 22 points and 10 assists. Kenrich Williams had eight points and 11 boards. J.J. Redick had 18 points and five rebounds. Nicolo Melli had 14 points off the bench, and E’Twaun Moore contributed 11 points as substitute.

Carmelo Anthony played for the first time in more than a year and finished with 10 points and four rebounds, although he shot 4-of-14 from the field. C.J. McCollum was Portland’s biggest scoring threat in Damian Lillard’s absence after finishing with 22 points and five assists. Hassan Whiteside had a double-double of 14 points and 14 rebounds. Anfernee Simmons had 13 points.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 123-105, at Madison Square Garden on Monday evening.

The Knicks (4-10) ended 2-1 during this three-game homestand and now they have improved to 3-4 at home, while the Cavaliers (4-9) fell to 2-5 on the road. David Fizdale's men controlled the game right from the start, as they jumped to a 32-20 lead after the first quarter and they would never look back. The second quarter ended with a 32-31 score for New York, but they pulled away for good in the third with a 30-20 score. The Cavaliers closed the gap in the final 12 minutes of action with a 34-29 lead in garbage time, but it wasn't enough and the Knicks cruised their way to a huge win.

Julius Randle was the best player for the Knicks, and he ended with 30 points on 12-17 shooting. Marcus Morris Sr. ended with 34 points and six rebounds, while R.J. Barrett had 15 points. Kevin Knox II scored six points while going 2-of-10 from the field. Damyean Dotson had 11 points off the bench.

Kevin Porter Jr. led the way for the Cavaliers with 18 points and four rebounds, while rookie Darius Garland chipped in with 10 points. Collin Sexton might have ended with 14 points and three rebounds, but he struggled from the field and only made five of his 13 field goal attempts. The bench players thrived, though, with three scoring in double figures: Alfonzo McKinnie (14 points, six rebounds), Jordan Clarkson (13 points) and Brandon Knight (12 points).

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 115-86, at Barclays Center on Monday evening.

The Pacers (8-6) were on a two-game losing streak entering this contest, but they have bounced back with a strong performance on both ends of the court to defeat a struggling Nets (5-8) team that has lost four of its last six contest. With the win, Indiana moved to 3-4 on the road while Brooklyn fell to 3-3 at home. Indiana quickly dominate right from the start and while the first quarter ended 18-18, the Pacers pulled away for good in the second quarter thanks to a 41-17 score. The Nets couldn't bounce back after that horrific second period and while they won the third quarter 33-25, it was too late for them. Indiana closed things out with a 31-18 fourth-quarter score.

Aaron Holiday was the top scoring threat for the Pacers since he finished with 24 points, 13 assists and six rebounds, as he did a great job to fill the gap left by Malcolm Brogdon’s absence. Domantas Sabonis chipped in with a strong double-double of 16 points and 18 rebounds. Justin Holiday had 20 points, while T.J. Warren contributed 19 points and six rebounds. Naz Mitrou-Long added 12 points, three rebounds and three assists off the bench.

Spencer Dinwiddie replaced the injured Kyrie Irving and produced a stellar outing thanks to a 28-point, eight-assist, five-rebound performance. Jarrett Allen chipped with a double-double after finishing with 10 points and 12 rebounds. Garrett Temple had 10 points while also adding six boards and three dimes. Eight of nine bench players scored, but neither reached the 10-point plateau.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 132-96, at Scotiabank Arena on Monday night.

The game was ultimately truly a tale of two halves. Early on, the Hornets (6-8) did not give the slightest indication they were a team set to fold in the second half, trailing only 60-56 at halftime. However, Charlotte managed just 18 points in the third quarter while the Raptors (9-4) put up 32, and matters were even worse during a final period during which Toronto enjoyed a 40-22 advantage on their way to their biggest margin of victory of the season.

Marvin Williams led the Hornets with 14 points, adding four rebounds, one assist and two blocks. Miles Bridges and Bismack Biyombo generated matching 13-point tallies while pulling down five and two rebounds, respectively. Devonte' Graham provided 11 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Terry Rozier delivered 10 points, three rebounds and three assists. 

OG Anunoby paced the Raptors with 24 points, adding five rebounds, two assists, and two steals. Pascal Siakam managed 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. Norman Powell poured in 17 points and added six assists, two rebounds and two steals. Terence Davis finished with 16 points, seven assists, one rebound and one steal. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson furnished 15 points, eight boards and two assists. Fred VanVleet and Chris Boucher had matching 11-point contributions, with Boucher also pulling down 11 rebounds and VanVleet dishing out eight assists. 

The Hornets next pay a visit to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night, while the Raptors remain and tangle with the Orlando Magic on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Boston Celtics, 100-99, at Golden 1 Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Kings (5-7) were coming off a two-game winning streak before losing to the Lakers on Friday, but they have bounced back admirably with a huge win over the Celtics (10-2), a franchise that own one of the best records in The Association. Sacramento jumped to a huge 30-18 lead in the first quarter, but the Celtics flipped the script quickly and a 28-20 edge in the second quarter put them down by just four points at the half-time break. Boston won the third quarter by a 29-21 score and had a four-point lead ahead of the final 12 minutes of the contest. Sacramento, however, came out of nowhere to mount an impressive rally. Their 29-24 fourth-quarter score helped them get the win at home, and Richaun Holmes sealed the win with two clutch free throws with 13.3 seconds left on the clock. With the win, Sacramento moved to 3-3 at home while the Celtics are 5-2 on the road.

Buddy Hield was the biggest star of the game as he finished with 35 points, six rebounds, four steals and two assists. Harrison Barnes had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists. Nenad Bjelica had an impressive double-double with 12 points, 14 rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes. Bogdan Bogdanovic thrived off the bench since he ended the contest with 12 points in 31 minutes despite shooting 5-for-14 from the field.

Jaylen Brown was the top scoring threat for the Celtics since he had 18 points with eight rebounds and two steals. Kemba Walker had 15 points with nine assists, while Jayson Tatum and Daniel Theis each finished with 14 points. Tatum also had six rebounds, while Theis grabbed 10 rebounds in 22 minutes of action. Enes Kanter had 10 points as a substitute.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Golden State Warriors, 108-100, at Smoothie King Center on Sunday evening. 

As has been the norm recently, the Pelicans (4-9) came into Sunday's contest notably short-handed due to the injury bug, with Derrick Favors (back), Jahlil Okafor (ankle), Josh Hart (knee), Frank Jackson (neck) and Brandon Ingram (knee) all sidelined. However, New Orleans still got off to a strong start against the similarly depleted Warriors (2-12), forging a 55-49 halftime lead. Golden State would keep the pressure on throughout the second half, but they could get no closer than within five points in the fourth quarter on their way to yet another loss.

Eric Paschall paced the Warriors with 30 points, adding seven boards and two assists. Ky Bowman provided 19 points, four assists, two rebounds and one steal. Glenn Robinson III turned in 14 points, six rebounds and two assists. Marquese Chriss was the only other double-digit scorer for the Warriors with 10 points and added seven rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block.

J.J. Redick delivered 26 points, three rebounds and three assists. Jrue Holiday tallied 22 points, nine assists, eight rebounds, one steal and one block.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the New York Knicks, 103-102, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.

Graham led the way for the Hornets with 29 points, adding four rebounds and two assists. PJ Washington followed with 19 points, five boards, three assists, one steal and one block. Terry Rozier poured in 16 points and also pulled down four rebounds, dished out two assists and recorded two steals. Marvin Williams totaled 13 points, five rebounds, two assists and one steal. Malik Monk furnished 12 points, five assists, four boards and one block.

Brook Lopez supplied 15 points, eight rebounds, five blocks and one steal. Donte DiVincenzo drew the start and provided 14 points, four boards, one assist and two steals. Eric Bledsoe and Sterling Brown generated matching 10-point tallies while dishing out five and four assists, respectively.

Myles Turner led the Pacers in his return from an ankle injury, posting a 16-point, 11-rebound  double-double that also included two assists, four blocks and one steal. T.J. Warren poured in 15 points and also supplied five rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Domantas Sabonis managed an 11-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included two assists and one steal.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 108-97, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Thursday evening. 

The Heat (8-3) had no problems to secure another solid win thanks to a strong performance on the road against a struggling, inconsistent Cavaliers (4-7) team.

Miami also won the second quarter by the same score, so they had an impressive 24-point lead at the break (68-44). Cleveland won the third and fourth quarters, 30-26 and 23-14, respectively, but that wasn't enough. Miami cruised their way to a win thanks to a solid effort on both ends of the court. With the win, Miami improved to 4-3 on the road while the Cavaliers dropped to 2-3 at home.

Kendrick Nunn was the best player for the Cavaliers since he ended with 23 points, eight assists, five rebounds, and two steals. Bam Adebayo registered 16 points and 15 rebounds, but also added five assists in 40 minutes. Jimmy Butler had 14 points, six assists, three steals and two blocks. Meyers Leonard had 12 points with seven assists. Tyler Herro looked impressive off the bench since he finished with 16 points in 22 minutes.

Kevin Love led the way for the Cavaliers with a strong double-double of 21 points and 10 rebounds, but he also added four steals. Collin Sexton had 15 points, four rebounds and three assists.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 124-115, at Fiserv Forum on Thursday night.

The Bucks (8-3) were playing their first full game in what is expected to be a multi-week absence for Khris Middleton (quadriceps), putting even more responsibility than usual on linchpins Giannis Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe. Both players responded in fine fashion, but Antetokounmpo was especially impressive with a 38-point, 16-rebound double-double. The Bulls (4-8) admirably played a competitive game and even led 66-65 at halftime, but Milwaukee gained some separation in the third quarter and took an 11-point edge into the final period. Chicago would get as close as 117-114 with 1:53 remaining, but the hosts would finish on a 7-1 run to seal the win.

Coby White came off the bench to lead the Bulls in scoring for the second straight game, posting 26 points and adding five rebounds, three assists, and three steals. Zach LaVine was a close second with 25 points, complementing them with seven assists, three rebounds, three steals and one block. Wendell Carter, Jr. tallied 14 points, six boards and one assist. Lauri Markkanen and Thaddeus Young generated matching 11-point tallies while pulling down eight and seven rebounds, respectively.

Antetokounmpo added four assists, three steals and one block to his team-leading double-double. Bledsoe delivered 31 points, eight assists, four rebounds and two steals. Wesley Matthews managed 15 points and four boards. Brook Lopez contributed 13 points and six rebounds.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 132-127, at Smoothie King Arena on Thursday night.

What would have shaped up as a star-studded affair on the schedule prior to the season was instead a serious victim of attrition. The Pelicans (3-8) were particularly short-handed, with Zion Williamson (knee), Brandon Ingram (knee), Lonzo Ball (hip), Josh Hart (knee) and Jahlil Okafor (ankle) all out of action, while Kawhi Leonard (knee/load management) sat for the Clippers (7-5). However, Los Angeles did have their other prized offseason acquisition in action for the first time, as Paul George made his team/season debut after recovering from offseason surgery on both shoulders. George was spectacular, pacing the visitors with 33 points and adding nine rebounds and four assists. but New Orleans' 36-point fourth quarter was ultimately enough to garner them a tough home victory.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Washington Wizards, 140-133, at TD Garden on Wednesday night.

The Celtics (9-1) are arguably the hottest team in The Association and currently own the league's best record with an 8-1 mark following their eighth straight victory against a struggling Wizards (2-7) team that continues to slip down the Eastern Conference standings week after week. Things were quite even after the first quarter, however, as the first 12 minutes of action ended with a 34-34 tie although Boston would take control afterwards. The Celtics won each of the remaining three quarters (34-32, 34-30 and 38-37, respectively) and both teams combined for 273 points in total. The Wizards fought hard, but the Celtics were too much for them and as a result, Boston kept their sizzling winning run alive. With the win, Boston moved to 5-0 at home while the Wizards dropped to 1-4 on the road.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 98-97, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday night. 

The 76ers (7-3) got a nice boost in the form of an earlier-than-expected return from Ben Simmons, who was able to take the floor for his usual workload Tuesday after not having been expected back until later in the week. With Al Horford sitting the game out for rest, Philadelphia had trouble separating from the Cavaliers (4-6) in the first half. Cleveland then knocked two points off their six-point deficit during the third quarter, setting up a nip-and-tuck final period. Ultimately, Kevin Love failed to drain a 29-foot three-point jumper with 3.8 seconds remaining that would have erased the Sixers' 98-97 lead, essentially sealing the win for Philadelphia.

Love and Jordan Clarkson co-led the Cavaliers with matching 20-point tallies, with Love notably pulling down eight rebounds. Collin Sexton furnished 18 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Tristan Thompson generated a 17-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included one steal. No other Cleveland player was able to score in double digits.

Joel Embiid paced the 76ers with a 27-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included four assists, two blocks and one steal. Josh Richardson tallied 17 points, five assists, one rebound and one steal. Simmons produced 15 points, six assists, five rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Furkan Korkmaz started and posted 10 points, four boards and one assist.

The Cavaliers return home to host the Miami Heat on Thursday night, while the 76ers pay a visit to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday evening.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Detroit Pistons, 117-108, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday evening.

The Heat (7-3) entered this game following a three-game road trip where they went 1-2, but they showed once again why they are one of the best teams in the league at home -- Miami led the way from start to finish, and cruised their way against a Pistons (4-8) squad that never had answers to slow down a depleted Miami squad that featured several absences. The Heat jumped to a 28-17 lead following the first quarter, and they would never look back afterwards since they also won the second quarter by a 31-20 score. With a 22-point lead entering the second half, Detroit required magic to turn things around. Even though the Pistons won the subsequent two quarters, 35-33 and 36-25 respectively, Miami tightened things up down the stretch and won the contest. With the win, Miami improved to 4-0 at home while the Pistons fell to 1-5 on the road. It was also Detroit's third straight defeat.

Jimmy Butler led the way for the Heat with an impressive double-double of 20 points and 13 assists, while also adding three boards and two steals in 39 minutes. Kendrick Nunn also had 20 points, and he added five assists, three rebounds and two steals. Bam Adebayo had 18 points with 14 rebounds, but he was ejected from the game in the second half. Goran Dragic came off the bench and delivered 18 points with six assists in 33 minutes.

Luke Kennard led the way for the Pistons since he finished with 22 points and five assists. Andre Drummond had 16 points, nine rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Markieff Morris had 13 points, three rebounds and three dimes. Christian Wood had 16 points off the bench, while Thon Maker chipped in with 12 points and three blocks in only 20 minutes off the bench.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the New York Knicks, 120-102, at United Center on Tuesday night.

The Bulls (4-7) appeared to set an early tone with a 30-point first quarter, and the Knicks (2-9) only managed to knock two points off an eight-point deficit heading into halftime. New York's best quarter was the third, when it managed to draw even with Chicago heading into the final period. However, a 19-0 run by the home squad between the 11:00 and 5:51 marks of the fourth quarter put the game out of reach.

Marcus Morris led the Knicks with 22 points, adding nine rebounds, one assist and one block. R.J. Barrett rebounded from a recent slump to generate 21 points, nine assists, six rebounds and two steals. Julius Randle and Taj Gibson had matching 17-point tallies while pulling down six and five rebounds, respectively. Kevin Knox led the bench with 10 points. 

Coby White paced the Bulls with 27 points, adding three rebounds, one assist and one steal. Zach LaVine followed with 25 points, complementing them with six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Wendell Carter, Jr. generated a 17-point, 12-rebound double-double. Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn had matching 13-point contributions while hauling in eight and five rebounds, respectively. 

The Knicks head back home to face the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night, while the Bulls pay a visit to the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday evening as well.

They ended up shooting 51 percent from the field while recording 32 assists.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Golden State Warriors, 122-108, at Chase Center on Monday night. 

The Jazz (7-3) knew they'd be facing a Warriors (2-9) squad with a little more star power than they'd had recently, as Draymond Green was set to return from his finger injury.

Golden State was able to knock three points of its deficit in the third quarter, but the Jazz was able to hold them off for the double-digit road victory. Green logged 22 minutes in his return, compiling four points, seven rebounds and four assists.

Rudy Gobert paced the Jazz with a 25-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included one assist, two blocks and one steal. Donovan Mitchell followed with 23 points and complemented them with eight boards and six assists. Mike Conley registered 22 points, seven assists and one rebound. Bojan Bogdanovic and Jeff Green produced matching 12-point tallies on the starting five and off the bench, respectively. Joe Ingles contributed 11 points and seven assists on the second unit, while Emmanuel Mudiay turned in 11 points, four rebounds and one assist in his return from a hamstring injury.

D'Angelo Russell led the Warriors with 33 points, adding eight assists, two rebounds and one steal. Jordan Poole and Marquese Chriss posted 11 points and six rebounds apiece. Alec Burks delivered 10 points off the bench, while Willie Cauley-Stein mustered just eight points but also pitched in 11 rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in overtime, 100-98, at Target Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Nuggets (7-2) picked up their fourth straight win and although an overtime period was needed, in the end they had what was needed to defeat a resilient Timberwolves (5-4) team that was also coming off a win this past Friday. It was a game that went back and forth following the first quarter, though. After a 27-27 score following the first 12 minutes of action, Minnesota grabbed the lead by two points at the half-time break (51-49). Denver turned things around with a 27-13 third quarter, but Minnesota stormed back and won the final 12 minutes by a 26-14. That led to an overtime period where Denver looked more accurate, and that sealed the win for them. With the win, Denver improved to 4-1 on the road, while Minnesota dropped to 2-2 at home.

Nikola Jokic was Denver’s top scorer with 20 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Jamal Murray had 15 points and five boards, while Gary Harris added 13 points, six rebounds and two steals.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 121-109, at State Farm Arena on Friday night.

The Kings (3-6) came into the contest looking to start a new winning streak after seeing their first one of the season snapped their last time on the court. Sacramento got off to a good start in that regard, building a 31-24 first-quarter lead that they'd expanded to 16 points by halftime. That cushion would prove to be pivotal, as the Hawks (3-5) came out strong out of intermission and outscored Sacramento by a 36-28 margin in the third to slice their deficit in half. That surge woke the Kings back up, as they finished with a 30-26 advantage over the final 12 minutes to notch the double-digit road win.

Buddy Hield paced the Kings with 22 points, adding five rebounds, one assist and one block. Bogdan Bogdanovic led the bench with 20 points and complemented them with five assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. De'Aaron Fox followed with 17 points, nine assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. Harrison Barnes contributed 16 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals, while Trevor Ariza (14 points) and Nemanja Bjelica (13 points) were also in double digits. 

Trae Young paced the Hawks with a 30-point, 12-assist double-double that also included two rebounds and five steals. Jabari Parker delivered 25 points, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Kyle Huerter led the bench with 17 points, and no other Atlanta player managed to score in double digits. 

The Kings return home to face the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night, while the Hawks pay a visit to those same Blazers on Sunday night.

Boston's nine-point lead at the break extended in the second half, and the Celtics won the third and fourth quarter, 33-24 and 23-20, respectively. With the win, the Celtics improved to 3-1 away, while the Hornets are now 2-2 at home.

Kemba Walker went 0-for-6 in the first half, but settled down afterwards and finished with 14 points and six assists. Gordon Hayward was the Celtics' best player, however, as he came quite close to a triple-double after posting 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jayson Tatum was Boston's top scorer since he had 23 points with nine rebounds and two steals. Jaylen Brown had 12 points, and Javonte Green chipped in with 12 points off the bench.

The Hornets struggled offensively, and the best example of that was the fact that only two Hornets scored in double digits in this game. The main scorer was Miles Bridges, who had 18 points with 10 rebounds, while Devonte Graham contributed 15 points, nine assists and four rebounds. Cody Zeller grabbed 10 rebounds. Terry Rozier struggled, scoring just three points while going 1-for-11 from the field.

The Pacers (4-4) came into the contest having just narrowly missed a fourth consecutive win against the Hornets in overtime Tuesday night. There may have been a bit of fatigue at play early, with the two teams battling to a 26-26 tie through the first 12 minutes. However, Indiana would go on to outscore the Wizards (2-5) by a 68-54 margin over the second and third quarters, giving them the separation they'd need to clinch a double-digit home win. 

Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 30 points despite shooting just 1-for-12 from three-point range, adding five rebounds and five assists. Thomas Bryant generated an 20-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists. C.J. Miles poured in 15 points and also turned in three assists, two rebounds and two blocks. Davis Bertans compiled 11 points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal. Isaiah Thomas registered 10 points and four assists. 

T.J. Warren set the pace for the Pacers with 21 points, complementing them with four boards, two assists and one steal. Doug McDermott led the bench with 19 points and also supplied seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. Jakarr Sampson drew another start and provided 14 points, six rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Domantas Sabonis overcame his recent calf injury to contribute a 13-point, 17-rebound double-double that also included seven assists, two steals and one block. Goga Bitadze matched Sabonis' scoring tally and added three rebounds and an assist, while Malcolm Brogdon registered a 12-point, 13-assist double-double that also included one steal. 

The Wizards head back home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night, while the Pacers remain home to tangle with the Detroit Pistons on Friday evening as well.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 113-93, at State Farm Arena on Wednesday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 108-100, at State Farm Arena on Tuesday evening.

The Hawks (3-3) clearly felt the absence of Trae Young since they were 2-0 with him, and 0-3 since he got injured. The star point guard returned to action this Tuesday at home against the Spurs (4-3) and was pivotal for the win with an impressive showing. The game was tight during the first half, as the Spurs built a 45-44 lead following the first two quarters. Gregg Popovich's men built an eight-point lead (78-70) with 12 minutes left to play, but the Hawks turned things around in the final 12 minutes of action. A 38-22 win for Atlanta in the fourth quarter was enough to lift the Eastern Conference franchise on top in this game.

Trae Young was magnificent for the Hawks, since he finished with 29 points and 13 assists in his return from injury. Jabari Parker had 19 points, eight rebounds and two assists. Rookie Cam Reddish had 12 points, while De’Andre Hunter chipped in with 16 points and eight boards. The 11 players that featured for Atlanta scored at least one point.

DeMar DeRozan continues to lead the Spurs in scoring, and such was the case here once again since he finished with 22 points, four assists, four rebounds, three steals and two blocks. LaMarcus Aldridge had 14 points, and Bryn Forbes provided a strong scoring touch with 17 points in 31 minutes. Patty Mills delivered 16 points off the bench.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons, 115-99, at Capital One Arena on Monday night.

The Pistons (4-4) and the Wizards (2-4) haven't been able to show a lot of consistency in their games so far, but in this occasion, the home side was miles better and didn't have many issues to secure the win here.  The first half of the game was quite even, though. Washington won the first two quarters, 31-30 y 32-31, respectively, but they would break free in the third quarter. A 30-17 win for Washington in the third quarter gave the Wizards a double-digit lead after three quarters, and a 22-21 in the final 12 minutes of action allowed them to close things out. Washington won three of four quarters by just one point. But the third quarters was the main difference here.

Bradley Beal led the way for the Wizards since he finished with 22 points, six assists and five rebounds.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 107-100, at FedEx Forum on Monday night.

The Rockets (3-3) were coming off a 129-100 drubbing at the hands of the Heat on Sunday that was actually much worse than the final score indicated, but coach Mike D'Antoni stuck to his plan of letting Russell Westbrook sit for rest Monday. The star point guard's absence helped lead to a tight 62-60 halftime lead for Houston, but the Rockets managed to turn the defense on in the third quarter. They limited the Grizzlies (1-4) to 16 points during the period and then hung on in the final period as Memphis bounced back with 24 points. As expected, James Harden shouldered extra offensive responsibility with Westbrook out and put up a game-high 44 points.

Harden added 10 rebounds, six assists, two steals and one block to his team-high scoring tally. Eric Gordon drew the start with Westbrook out and finished with 16 points, five boards, one assist and one steal. Danuel House, Jr. tallied 15 points, nine boards, one assist, three blocks and one steal. Ben McLemore poured in 12 points off the bench, while Clint Capela mustered a 10-point, 13-rebound double-double that included two assists and one steal.

Ja Morant paced the Grizzlies with 23 points, supplementing them with six assists, five rebounds and one steal. Dillon Brooks collected 17 points, nine boards, one assist and two steals. Bruno Caboclo posted 11 points, five rebounds, one assist, two steals and two blocks. Jonas Valanciunas contributed a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists and one block. Kyle Anderson and Tyus Jones managed matching 10-point, five-rebound tallies. 

The Rockets head back home to take on the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, while the Grizzlies remain home to tangle with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Chicago Bulls, 108-95, at Banker's Life Fieldhouse on Sunday.

The Pacers (3-3) started their season with an 0-3 mark, but they have bounced back thanks to three straight wins, although things have not been easy for them since they have dealt with injuries of late. The Bulls (2-5) never had an answer for Indiana's offense, and the best example for that was the fact that Indiana dominated the contest right from tip-off. Indiana jumped to a 24-18 lead after the first quarter, and they would never look back afterwards. They extended their lead to a 13-point edge at the halftime break after a 31-24 second quarter. While Chicago won the third quarter by a 32-31 score, their comeback fell short. The Pacers won the final quarter 22-21, and they didn't have problems to close the game out.

T.J. Warren paced the way for the Pacers, who didn't have Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner, with 26 points, five rebounds and three assists. Malcolm Brogdon chipped in with 22 points and seven assists. Jeremy Lamb had 11 points, six rebounds and five assists. T.J. Lead had a good game off the bench, posting a 13-point, 15-rebound effort in 22 minutes of action.

Zach LaVine was the top scorer for the Bulls after finishing with 21 points, six rebounds and two assists. Wendell Carter Jr. had 20 points with 10 rebounds. Lauri Markkanen chipped in with 11 points and six boards. Thaddeus Young had a good game off the bench with 12 points, three boards and three steals in 26 minutes of action.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the host Washington Wizards, 131-109, at Verizon Center on Saturday.

It's rare to see a road team win in wire-to-wire fashion but that's what Minnesota did here. In fact, the Timberwolves rode a 42-34 first quarter to a big lead and then carried a 28-22 second quarter and 36-16 third quarters to their dominating victory. That gave them a game-high 34-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. Minnesota won the defensive rebounding battle, 44-31 while out-assisting Washington 33-21. They also shot 54 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range while holding the Wizards to 39 percent from the field and 34 percent from long range. 

The Timberwolves (4-1) had to play this game without Karl-Anthony Towns but were led by Andrew Wiggins and his 21 points, five rebounds and six assists. Jeff Teague accrued 15 points, four rebounds, 13 assists and three steals. Gorgui Dieng started for Towns and provided 18 points, eight rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Jarrett Culver led the bench with 20 points and five boards.

The Wizards (1-4) were led by Bradley Beal, who scored 30 points but committed six turnovers. No other starter reached double figures in scoring but Thomas Bryant did amass three points, 10 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Isaiah Thomas led the bench with 16 points, four rebounds and seven assists. 

Both teams return to action on Monday, with Washington playing host to the Detroit Pistons and Minnesota welcoming the Milwaukee Bucks to Target Center.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Toronto Raptors, 115-105, at Fiserv Forum on Saturday night.

The Bucks (4-2) seeming opened the contest ready to make a statement, building an impressive 36-17 lead through 12 minutes. The Raptors (4-2) were much better in the second quarter while compiling 33 points, but they only shaved three points off their deficit. However, they came out of the halftime locker room just as hot and entered the final period trailing by just five points. That's when Milwaukee turned up the defensive dial, limiting Toronto to just 15 points during the fourth quarter and going on a 13-7 run over the final 5:41 to seal the home win.

Kyle Lowry led the way for the Raptors with 36 points, adding six assists, four rebounds and one block. Pascal Siakam delivered 16 points, five boards, one assist and one steal. Fred VanVleet totaled 12 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Serge Ibaka furnished 11 points and four boards off the bench. Marc Gasol generated a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included three assists and one block. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo paced the Bucks with 36 points and complemented them with 15 rebounds, eight assists, four blocks and one steal. Eric Bledsoe registered 14 points, nine rebounds, five assists and one steal. Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton generated matching 11-point tallies, with Middleton also dishing out seven assists.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 129-128, at Moda Center on Saturday night.

The 76ers (5-0) came into the night knowing they'd be facing an uphill battle to keep their record unblemished without the services of Joel Embiid (suspension). Philadelphia had won one game without Embiid already this season, however, but they quickly fell behind by a 68-57 margin to the Trail Blazers (3-3) at halftime. The visitors would then begin their comeback in the third quarter, setting up a wild fourth quarter. The Sixers were down by as much as 125-118 with 3:25 remaining, but an 11-3 run culminating in Furkan Korkmaz's 24-foot three-point jumper with 0.4 seconds left won the game for Philadelphia.

Al Horford led the way for the 76ers with 25 points, adding seven assists, five rebounds, two blocks and one steal.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 102-95, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday night.

The Pacers (2-3) had gotten their season off to an uncharacteristically poor start, but Friday, they were returning to the scene of the majority of their successes last season. Indiana had a bit of revenge to extract on the Cavaliers (2-3) after Cleveland had already handed them a loss in the second game of the campaign. The visitors looked to be on their way to getting the better of Indiana again early by building a 26-19 lead through 12 minutes, but the home squad managed to turn the tables and then some in the second to take a 42-37 lead into halftime. Indiana then preserved their lead by holding off an early fourth-quarter surge by Cleveland with the help of a 12-3 run later in the period.

Kevin Love paced the Cavaliers with a 22-point, 17-rebound double-double that also included four assists and one steal. Collin Sexton followed with 21 points, complementing them with three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Jordan Clarkson led the bench with 20 points and also posted five assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Cedi Osman contributed 10 points, four rebounds, one assist and three steals. Tristan Thompson mustered just seven points but also pulled down 10 rebounds. 

Malcolm Brogdon led the Pacers with 25 points and supplemented them with nine rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block. Jeremy Lamb generated a 21-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one assist, two steals and one block. Domantas Sabonis provided 18 points, 17 boards, four assists and two blocks. Justin Holiday and Doug McDermott contributed eight points apiece.

The Cavaliers return home to face the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday evening, while the Pacers remain home to tangle with the Chicago Bulls on Sunday afternoon as well.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the host Dallas Mavericks in overtime, 119-110, at American Airlines Center on Friday. 

There were seven ties and 12 lead changes in the second half alone, as that eventually led to an overtime session. Danny Green actually hit a game-tying three-pointer at the end of regulation to send the game into OT and then the Lakers started the overtime session on a 7-0 run to take command. Dallas never tied or re-captured the lead from there, with Los Angeles outscoring them in the OT session, 16-7. Defense was critical for the Lakers, holding the Mavericks to 39 percent from the field while winning the turnover differential, 22-11. Much of that was due to Los Angeles recording 11 steals and seven blocks to Dallas' five steals and one block. The Lakers ended up shooting 49 percent from the field too.  

The Lakers (3-1) got a triple-double from LeBron James, who accumulated 39 points, 12 rebounds, 16 assists and four steals. Anthony Davis accrued 31 points, eight rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Green scored 14 points while Avery Bradley totaled 11 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 106-97, at State Farm Arena on Thursday night.

The Heat (4-1) came into the Halloween night affair looking to get the best of the Hawks (2-3) for the second time this week and sweep the home-and-home series. Miami had a sizable personnel advantage going in with Trae Young ruled out for Atlanta due to the ankle injury he'd suffered in Tuesday's matchup. After a strong start by the home team, the visitors took control and didn't really look back. After the Heat found itself down 14-8 with 6:50 remaining, they outscored their hosts by a 98-83 margin the rest of the way. With Young out, the Hawks' bench did the majority of the scoring for the team on the night, compiling 60 of the team's 97 points. 

Kendrick Nunn paced the Heat with 28 points, complementing them with two rebounds and two steals. Tyler Herro furnished 17 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal. Meyers Leonard registered 16 points, eight rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Bam Adebayo and Duncan Robinson, the latter who started for Justise Winslow (back), posted 12 points each, with Adebayo also dishing out seven assists and pulling in six boards. Jimmy Butler shot just 2-for-10 on his way to five points, but he added 11 assists, nine rebounds, six steals and three blocks. 

Jabari Parker led the way for the Hawks with 23 points, adding eight rebounds and two assists. DeAndre' Bembry provided 18 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Tyrone Wallace and John Collins contributed matching 12-point tallies while pulling down three and seven rebounds, respectively. Cam Reddish's shooting struggles continued with nine points on a 2-for-11 mark from the floor. 

The Heat heads back home to take on the Houston Rockets on Sunday evening, while the Hawks are off until Tuesday night when they host the San Antonio Spurs.

With that said, the Clippers won each of the final three quarters, holding the lead for the entirety of the second half. Turnovers were the difference in the game, with Los Angeles winning that battle, 18-11. Both benches came up big, with the Clippers scoring 44 bench points and the Spurs dropping 42 points off their bench. Three-point shooting kept San Antonio around, with Los Angeles shooting just 5-of-27 and the Spurs connecting on 7-of-21.

The Spurs (3-1) were led by DeMar DeRozan, who tallied 29 points, seven rebounds and two assists. No other starter reached double figures in scoring. Derrick White was the only other player in double figures, providing 20 points, five rebounds, two assists and two blocks off the bench.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Chicago Bulls, 117-111, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday night.

The Bulls (1-4) came in looking to capitalize on an opportunity against a fellow losing squad in the Cavaliers (2-2). However, the two teams proved to be closely matched from the start, with Chicago holding a slim 53-50 halftime advantage. They continued to match each other basket for basket in the third period before Cleveland finally found a way to pull away late. The home squad finished the game on a 9-5 run after the Bulls had managed to pull to within 106-104 with 2:52 remaining, leading to the hard-fought home win. 

Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine co-led the Bulls with 16 points apiece, with Markkanen adding eight rebounds. Wendell Carter, Jr. and Otto Porter, Jr. followed with matching 15-point tallies, pulling down eight and five rebounds, respectively. Thaddeus Young paced the second unit with 14 points, five rebounds, one assist and one steal. 

Tristan Thompson paced the Cavaliers with 23 points, complementing them with 10 rebounds, two assists and five blocks. Collin Sexton furnished 18 points, two rebounds and two assists. Kevin Love and Jordan Clarkson went for 17 points each, with Love also pulling down 20 rebounds, dishing out six assists and recording one steal. Cedi Osman and Larry Nance, Jr. posted 12 points apiece.

The Bulls head back home to take on the Detroit Pistons on Friday night, while the Cavaliers hit the road and tangle with the Indiana Pacers on Friday evening.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the New York Knicks, 95-83, at Amway Center on Wednesday night.

The Magic (2-2) were coming off back-to-back losses and recently lost against the reigning NBA champions, the Toronto Raptors, on Monday night. But Orlando bounced back with a strong performance against a Knicks (1-4) squad seriously hampered by injuries. However, the Knicks got off to a better start here, winning the first quarter by three points (25-22) and leading by two at the half-time break (44-42). The Magic would break free in the second half as they flipped the script with a 30-23 third-quarter score, and closed things out with a 23-16 edge in the final 12 minutes of action. New York didn't have answers to contain Orlando in the second half.

Nikola Vucevic led the way for the Magic with 21 points and 13 rebounds, while adding four assists. Aaron Gordon had a double-double as well, finishing with 15 points and 11 rebounds. Jonathan Isaac filled the stat sheet admirably for the Magic, as he ended the contest with 10 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Evan Fournier had 14 points, three rebounds and three assists. All 10 Magic players that stepped on the hardwood had at least two points.

Julius Randle was New York's biggest scoring threat since he finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Mitchell Robinson had 12 points, five rebounds, three blocks, and two assists. Bobby Portis had 12 points and 10 rebounds off the bench, while Kevin Knox contributed 10 points. Marcus Morris Sr. disappointed, though, after going 2-for-11 from the field and finishing with only nine points.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 117-95, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

A 32-24 first quarter really set the tone in this game and then a 30-19 second quarter put the game to bed. In fact, the Sixers held a double-digit lead for the entirety of the second half. Philadelphia ended up shooting 47 percent from the field and 36 percent from three-point range while holding Minnesota to 40 percent from the field and 29 percent from long range. The Sixers doubled up the T'Wolves in assists 24-12 while out-rebounding them, 56-34. Both Karl-Anthony Towns and Joel Embiid got ejected in the third quarter due to a scuffle. 

The Timberwolves (3-1) were led by Andrew Wiggins, who tallied 19 points, five rebounds and two assists. Jeff Teague amassed 15 points and five assists. Towns accrued 13 points, six rebounds and two steals before being ejected. Shabazz Napier led the bench with 13 points and two steals. 

The Sixers (4-0) were led by Embiid, who accumulated 19 points, five rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris totaled 18 points, nine rebounds and two assists.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 116-105, at TD Garden on Wednesday night. 

Following a humiliating loss to the 76ers on Opening Night, the Celtics (3-1) had seemingly righted their ship by notching victories in their next two games. However, a difficult challenge in the form of the Bucks (2-2) awaited Wednesday, and things looked bleak for the home squad early when Milwaukee forged a 34-19 lead through the first 12 minutes. Then, the surge that would result in Boston outscoring their visitors by a 97-71 margin the rest of the way began with a much more competitive second quarter. The Celtics were at their best in the third, erasing a 16-point halftime deficit and entering the final period with a four-point lead. Eventually, a 13-7 run over the first 5:25 of the fourth quarter helped the Celtics gain enough separation for the victory.

Khris Middleton led the Bucks with 26 points, adding six boards and three assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo generated a 22-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included five assists, two blocks and one steal. George Hill delivered 12 points, five rebounds and two assists. Brook Lopez collected 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Eric Bledsoe mustered just seven points, five rebounds and five assists. 

Kemba Walker led a big night for the first unit with 32 points, supplementing them with six rebounds and six assists. Jayson Tatum totaled 25 points, four boards, two assists and one block. Gordon Hayward contributed a 21-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included seven assists, one steal and one block. Marcus Smart chipped in 19 points, six assists and four rebounds, while Daniel Theis drew the start at center and put up 11 points, nine boards, one assist and one block.

The Bucks continue on the road and head south to play the Orlando Magic on Friday night, while the Celtics remain home to tangle with the New York Knicks on Friday evening.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 118-108, at Barclays Center on Wednesday night.

The Pacers (1-3) finally secured their first win of the season and it couldn't have come at a better time, as they did on the road and against one of the -- at least on paper -- top teams in the Eastern Conference such as the Nets (1-3). Despite the fact Indiana lost Myles Turner to injury early in the first half and the fact Brooklyn were leading after the first two quarters by three points (63-60), the Pacers didn't rattle and used a big performance in the second half to turn things around. Indiana won the third quarter by a 30-20 score, and sealed the deal with a 28-25 effort in the final 12 minutes of action. Their second-half turnaround was pivotal to seal the deal.

Domantas Sabonis was Indiana's best player since he finished with 29 points, eight rebounds, four assists and one block. Jeremy Lamb had 25 points and seven rebounds, while Malcolm Brogdon came just two boards shy of a triple-double -- he finished with 21 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds. T.J. Warren had 20 points. Myles Turner had seven points in 10 minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle injury.

Kyrie Irving led the Nets once again since he finished with 28 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Caris LeVert had 15 points with six rebounds, and Joe Harris chipped in with 13 points. DeAndre Jordan only scored eight points, but grabbed a game-high 17 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie had 20 points and seven assists in 27 minutes off the bench.

The Hornets came out strong in the third and had the game tied up at 75, mid way through the quarter. They kept pushing and outscored the Kings 32-18 in the quarter, to take a nine-point lead into the final frame. The Hornets increased their lead to 14, four minutes into the fourth. The Kings kept fighting but could not make up the difference, as they dropped their fifth straight game to start the season.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Washington Wizards, 159-158, at Capital One Arena on Wednesday night. 

A game that will likely go down as one of the most exciting in NBA regular-season history showed its colors right from the start, with the two teams combining for 69 first-quarter points and the halftime score reading a very third-quarter-like 77-76 in favor of the Wizards (1-3). After Washington added another five points to their advantage during the third, they appeared in position to pull away. However, James Harden, who totaled a game-high 59 points, wouldn't let the Rockets (3-1) give up, and ultimately, it was his ability to draw a foul with 2.4 seconds remaining, make one of two free throws, and then secure the ball to run off the final ticks after missing the second one that secured the wild win for Houston.

Harden added nine assists, three rebounds and one steal to his game-high scoring tally. Clint Capela generated a 21-point, 12-rebound double double that also included three assists, one steal and one block. Russell Westbrook contributed a 17-point, 12-assist, 10-rebound triple-double that also included two steals and one block. Danuel House, Jr. followed with 16 points, seven boards, one assist, two steals and one block. Eric Gordon led the bench with 15 points, while Austin Rivers pitched in 11.

Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 46 points and also dished out eight assists, pulled down six rebounds and recorded three steals. Rui Hachimura continued the strong start to his career with 23 points and five rebounds. Davis Bertans tallied 21 points, three boards and two assists. Isaiah Thomas managed a 17-point, 10-assist double-double that also included two rebounds and one steal. Troy Brown supplied 14 points in his season debut, while Thomas Bryant posted a 13-point, 12-rebound double-double.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 112-97, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday night.

The Heat (3-1) was coming off a loss the last time out, but they did a great job to bounce back at home and in the season debut of Jimmy Butler, who missed the team's previous three games due to paternity leave. Miami quickly jumped to a 29-26 lead in the first quarter, and Miami never looked back afterwards. Atlanta saw star point guard Trae Young leave the game due to an ankle injury in the second quarter, and the Hawks couldn't adjust to the absence of their top scorer. Miami won the subsequent three quarters 30-23 and 29-21 respectively, essentially putting the game out of reach with 12 minutes left to play. Atlanta won the final quarter 27-24, but the Heat didn't lose grip of the game and cruised towards a comfortable 15-point win.

Tyler Herro was Miami's top scorer after scoring 29 points with seven rebounds off the bench. Jimmy Butler enjoyed a strong debut with the Heat, scoring 21 points to go along with five rebounds, three steals and two assists. Kendrick Nunn had 17 points with three assists, while Bam Adebayo delivered 17 points, 10 rebounds, three blocks, three assists and two steals. Goran Dragic had 21 points, three rebounds and three assists off the bench.

John Collins was Atlanta's main offensive threat and finished with 30 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Trae Young only had five points in 11 minutes before leaving due to injury. Jabari Parker had 12 points off the bench, and was the only other Atlanta player who scored in double digits. However, it's worth noting that all 12 Atlanta players that saw action scored at least three points.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Indiana Pacers, 96-94, at Little Caesars Arena on Monday night.

The Pistons (2-2) moved back to .500 with a solid performance although the game was far from settled until the final minutes of the contest. The hosts, however, came out on top thanks to a huge driving layup from Derrick Rose with less than 30 seconds left that kept the Pacers (0-3) winless thus far. The game saw Detroit starting the contest on top, however, as they jumped to an eight-point lead after the first quarter. Indiana, however, won the second quarter to keep things close. A low-scoring third quarter saw Detroit up by one in the third period (19-18) and while Indiana won the final quarter (23-18), it wasn't enough to turn things around and the Pistons secured their second win of the campaign.

Derrick Rose might have made the winning bucket, but he struggled throughout the game and finished with 10 points (on 16 shots) and six assists. Andre Drummond had a double-double of 18 points and 18 rebounds, as well as two blocks. Christian Wood had a double-double off the bench with 19 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. Luke Kennard delivered 14 points, four assists and three rebounds.

Domantas Sabonis led the way for the Pacers with 21 points and 14 rebounds. T.J. Warren had 19 points, five rebounds and five steals.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 134-123, at Smoothie King Center on Monday night.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Phoenix Suns, 97-95, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Monday night.

The Suns (2-2) had looked like an improved team throughout their first three games despite the absence of Deandre Ayton (suspension) for two of those contests, but the first quarter played out much like past games against the Jazz (3-1). Utah forged a 28-21 lead after the first 12 minutes, but Phoenix managed to prevent the deficit from getting any larger prior to halftime and then eliminated it altogether during the third period. That set up a back-and-forth final period, which boiled down all the way to the final second. That's when Devin Booker was whistled for a shooting foul against Donovan Mitchell, who drained both subsequent free throws to snap a 95-95 tie and clinch the win.

Bojan Bogdanovic paced the Jazz with 29 points, adding five rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block. Mitchell finished with 26 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Rudy Gobert generated a 15-point, 18-rebound double-double that also included one assist, two steals and one block. Jeff Green led the second unit with eight points.

Booker led the Suns with 21 points, supplementing them with three rebounds, one steal and one block. Kelly Oubre, Jr. delivered 18 points, three rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. Jevon Carter managed 15 points, four boards, three assists and two steals. Aron Baynes collected 12 points and three rebounds, while Ricky Rubio generated a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included eight assists. 

The Jazz head back home to take on the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night, while the Suns travel to face off with the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Golden State Warriors, 120-92, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday.

The Thunder (1-2) claimed their first win of the season thanks to an impressive effort on both sides of the court, as the Warriors (0-2) looked overmatched on both ends of the court as soon as the ball started bouncing in front of a sell-out 18,203 crowd at Oklahoma City. The Thunder quickly jumped to a 35-20 lead after the first quarter, and they never looked back. In fact, Oklahoma City scored exactly 35 points in each of the first three quarters, while the Thunder topped the 21-point mark just once. The result was Oklahoma City building a 105-68 lead entering the final 12 minutes of action. The Warriors won the final quarter 24-15, but that wasn't enough to mount a comeback and the Thunder won deservedly.

Despite coming off the bench, Dennis Schröder was the best player for the Thunder since he finished with 22 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four steals. Danilo Gallinari had 21 points, while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 19 points, nine rebounds and four dimes. Veteran point guard Chris Paul had 10 points in 19 minutes, while Terrance Ferguson chipped in with 13 points and four assists.

Stephen Curry was the top scorer for the Warriors since he finished with 23 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Draymond Green contributed 10 points but also added six rebounds, two steals and two assists. Marquese Chriss and Eric Paschall also contributed 10 points to the mix. No other Golden State player reached the 10-point mark. D'Angelo Russell only finished with six points while going 3-for-10 from the field.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 134-133, at FedEx Forum on Sunday evening.

The Grizzlies (1-2) and the Nets (1-2) played one of the most intense games during the 2019-20 young NBA season so far, as this contest was decided down the stretch thanks to a buzzer-beating three-pointer from Jae Crowder when the clock expired during the overtime period. Memphis jumped to a six-point lead after the first quarter, but the Nets won the following two quarters, 28-24 and 40-33 respectively, so they had a five-point lead entering the final 12 minutes of action. Memphis stormed back, though, and a driving layup from Ja Morant sent the game to overtime. The game was about to expire in overtime with the Nets leading by two points, but Crowder scored a buzzer-beating three-pointer to lift the hosts towards a huge win.

Rookie point guard Ja Morant led the way for Memphis with 30 points, nine assists and four rebounds. Dillon Brooks scored 21 points, and Jonas Valanciunas chipped in with 16 points, 11 rebounds and four assists. Jaren Jackson Jr. had 12 points, and three bench players scored in double digits as well. These were Kyle Anderson (13 points, four rebounds), Solomon Hill (13 points, five rebounds) and Brandon Clarke (10 points, seven rebounds).

Kyrie Irving led the way for the Nets with 37 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Caris LeVert had 27 points with five assists. Joe Harris had 13 points, while Taurean Prince had 12 points, six rebounds and two assists.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 131-126, in overtime at Fiserv Forum on Saturday evening. 

The Heat (2-0) once again took the floor without Jimmy Butler (personal) and Dion Waiters (suspension/coach's decision), but the same formula that worked in an impressive opening night win over the Grizzlies came through again. Goran Dragic continued to thrive in a bench role by scoring a team-high 25 points, and four of the five members of the starting five notched double-digit scoring. Miami mounted a furious comeback from a 70-53 halftime deficit, but four consecutive missed free throws at the end of regulation left the door open for a Giannis Antetokoumpo tip-in at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. In the extra period, the Heat's 8-1 run left the Bucks (1-1) too far behind to catch up.

Dragic added eight assists, six rebounds and one steal to his team-leading tally. Bam Adebayo followed with a 19-point, 13-rebound, eight-assist double-double that also included one block. Kendrick Nunn poured in 18 points and added five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Tyler Herro, Derrick Jones, Jr. and Kelly Olynyk all contributed 14 points apiece. Justise Winslow pitched in a 10-point, 13-rebound, seven-assist effort.

Antetokounmpo paced the Bucks with 29 points, complementing them with 17 rebounds, nine assists, three steals and two blocks. Khris Middleton managed 25 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal. Wesley Matthews and Kyle Korver provided 14 points each. Brook Lopez contributed 12 points and seven rebounds, while Ersan Ilyasova managed 11 points, five boards, one assist and one steal.

The Heat remain on the road and next face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday evening, while the Bucks remain home and tangle with the Cavaliers on Monday night.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 117-111, at Little Caesars Arena on Saturday night.

The 76ers (2-0) came in facing an uphill battle to a road win, considering Joel Embiid (ankle) was ruled out in the hours prior to tip-off. However, as has been the case in the past, that simply meant the rest of the starting five had to pick up the slack. Tobias Harris was certainly up to the task, putting up a team-high 29 points and adding seven rebounds, one assist and two steals. The game was a back-and-forth tussle through four quarters, but a 10-2 Philadelphia run in the latter stages of the final period helped seal the win over the Pistons (1-2). 

Al Horford followed Harris with 23 points, adding nine rebounds, five assists and one steal. Mike Scott furnished 17 points, three rebounds and one assist. Ben SImmons generated a 13-point, 10-assist double-double that also included four rebounds and seven steals. Josh Richardson and Shake Milton posted matching 10-point tallies.

Derrick Rose paced the Pistons with 31 points, adding three rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocks. Markieff Morris managed 17 points, six rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Luke Kennard supplied 16 points, two assists and one rebound. Andre Drummond posted a 13-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included one assist and two blocks. Christian Wood collected 11 points and five rebounds. 

The 76ers remain on the road and take on the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night, while the Pistons remain at home to take on the Indiana Pacers on Monday evening as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers, 110-99, at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Saturday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 108-107, in overtime at Pepsi Center on Friday night.

The two teams came into the contest fresh off impressive season-opening victories, but the Suns (1-1) were facing an uphill battle after promising second-year big man Deandre Ayton was surprisingly suspended for a violation of the NBA's Anti-Drug policy Thursday. Phoenix still came out strong and held a 45-39 halftime edge. However, the Nuggets (2-0) were resilient, erasing their deficit altogether in the third quarter and taking a two-point advantage into the fourth. After Ricky Rubio's two free throws with 1.8 seconds remaining eventually sent the game to overtime, Jamal Murray returned the favor by draining a pair of shots from the charity stripe in the closing seconds of the extra period and Torrey Craig blocked Devin Booker's three-point attempt with under a second left to seal the win.

Kelly Oubre, Jr. led the way for the Suns with 23 points, supplementing them with eight rebounds, two assists and two steals. Frank Kaminsky followed with a bench-leading 19 points and added 11 rebounds. Booker shot just 6-for-21 from the floor but managed 18 points, seven assists, five rebounds and one block. Aron Baynes drew the start for Ayton and collected 15 points, seven rebounds, three assists and one steal. 

Murray's 27 points paced the Nuggets, and he added seven boards, three assists, one steal and one block. Nikola Jokic generated a 23-point, 14-rebound, 12-assist triple-double that also included two blocks and one steal. Malik Beasley led the bench with 17 points and also garnered four rebounds, one assist and one steal. Gary Harris and Jerami Grant posted matching 13-point tallies. 

The Suns next take the court against the Clippers at home on Saturday night, while the Nuggets are off until Monday night, when they take on the Sacramento Kings in a road affair.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Detroit Pistons, 117-100, at Little Caesars Arena on Thursday night in Atlanta's regular-season opener.

The Hawks (1-0) were one of the few franchises that hadn't debuted in The Association after the first two days of the regular season, but they came out firing against the Pistons (1-1), a team that simply ran out of gas in the second half. The Hawks jumped to a six-point lead following the first 12 minutes of action (38-32) but Detroit flipped the script in the second quarter, winning that frame by nine points and securing a three-point lead heading into the half-time break (63-60). However, it was all Atlanta from there. The Hawks destroyed the Pistons in the remaining two quarters, winning 31-18 and 26-19 respectively, to secure their first win of the season in front of a sell-out crowd at Little Caesars Arena.

Trae Young led the way for the Hawks, as the second-year point guard came close to register a triple-double thanks to his 38 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. John Collins delivered a double-double of 18 points and 10 rebounds, while DeAndre Hunter finished with 14 points. Jabari Parker made some solid contributions off the bench with 18 points on 8-of-11 from the field. Rookie Cam Reddish struggled, however, going 0-for-6 and finishing with just one point.

Derrick Rose led the way for the Pistons despite coming off the bench, as he produced 27 points in only 25 minutes of action -- the veteran point guard went 11-of-16 from the field. Andre Drummond once again had a double-double since he finished with 21 points, 12 rebounds, four steals, two assists and one block. Luke Kennard had 13 points off the bench.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Indiana Pacers, 119-110, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday night.

The Pistons (1-0) came into the contest facing an uphill battle, considering they were playing a Pacers (0-1) team that excelled on its home court last season and would have to do it without star forward Blake Griffin (hamstring/knee). Detroit was able to set the right tone by essentially matching Indiana basket for basket in the first half and entering halftime with only a one-point deficit. Following another nip-and-tuck third quarter, the visitors were able to finish out on a 20-9 run over the final 5:52 to secure victory.

Andre Drummond paced the Pistons with a 32-point, 23-rebound double-double that also included two assists, four blocks and three steals. Luke Kennard followed with a bench-leading 30 points. Derrick Rose furnished 18 points, nine assists and two rebounds. Tony Snell supplied 10 points, two rebounds and two assists. Markieff Morris started for Griffin and managed eight points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal.

Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 27 points, complementing them with 13 boards and two assists. Myles Turner contributed 25 points, nine rebounds, three blocks and two steals. Malcolm Brogdon generated a 22-point, 11-assist double-double that also included three rebounds and a block. Jeremy Lamb and T.J. Warren had matching 10-point tallies.

The Pistons head back to Motown for their home opener against the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday evening, while the Pacers pay a visit to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Brooklyn Nets in overtime, 127-126, at Barclays Center on Wednesday.

The Timberwolves (1-0) and the Nets (0-1) played an exciting game that went down to the wire, as the Nets had a chance to secure the win but Kyrie Irving missed the final shot on overtime. In any case, this was a back-and-forth game that included a huge Brooklyn rally during the second half. Minnesota jumped to a 33-22 lead after the first quarter and increased that advantage to 12 points at the break (68-56) before the Nets got themselves in front after three thanks to a dazzling performance in the third quarter (37-20; 93-88). Minnesota didn't back down, however, and sent the game to OT after winning the final 12-minute frame by five (27-22). The Timberwolves relied on Andrew Wiggins on overtime and Irving couldn't win it for Brooklyn at the buzzer.

Wiggins scored 21 points with eight rebounds for the Timberwolves but their best player was Karl-Anthony Towns, as the talented big man ended with 36 points, 14 rebounds, three assists, three blocks and three steals. Robert Covington chipped in with 15 points and nine rebounds, while Jeff Teague contributed 14 points, four assists and three boards. Josh Okogie (11 points) and Jake Layman (10 points) scored in double figures off the bench.

Irving had a game to remember after finishing with 50 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and zero turnovers, but his effort wasn't enough to lead Brooklyn to a win. Caris LeVert had 20 points with five rebounds, four assists and three steals, while Joe Harris delivered 14 points. Taurean Prince contributed 15 points with 11 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie had 14 in 19 minutes off the bench.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 120-101, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday evening.

The Heat (1-0) announced earlier in the day that prized offseason acquisition Jimmy Butler would miss the season opener for personal reasons. With Dion Waiters already suspended for the contest as well, that left the Miami starting five notably short-handed. After a slow first quarter in which they were outscored by four points, the home squad would go on to outscore the Grizzlies (0-1) by a 59-52 margin in the middle periods and outpace Memphis by a 37-17 margin over the final 12 minutes to seal the big home victory.

Jaren Jackson, Jr. led the Grizzlies with 17 points, adding three rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Tyus Jones followed with a bench-leading 15 points, complementing them with seven assists, one rebound and two steals. Second overall pick Ja Morant posted 14 points, four rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block in his regular-season debut. Jae Crowder totaled 13 points, five rebounds, two assists and one steal. 

Justise Winslow led the Heat with 27 points, complementing them with seven rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block. Kris Nunn provided 24 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Goran Dragic came off the bench to pitch in 19 points, three rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Rookie Tyler Herro poured in 14 points and added eight rebounds, one assist and two steals. Bam Adebayo matched Herro's scoring and added 11 rebounds, three assists and one steal. 

The Grizzlies head home to take on the Chicago Bulls on Friday evening, while the Heat pay a visit to the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday afternoon.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the visiting Boston Celtics, 107-93, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

Philadelphia is expected to be the cream of the crop in the east and a double-digit victory over Boston in the opener is a great tone-setter. After trailing by five points after the first quarter, the Sixers won each of the final three quarters by at least five points apiece. Philly's defense was critical, holding Boston to 37 percent from the field and 27 percent from three-point range. Free-throw shooting also killed the Celtics, hitting just 20-of-34.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the visiting Washington Wizards, 108-100, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday.

While this final margin was fairly close, Dallas was in control throughout. In fact, Dallas led by at least five points for the final 32 minutes of action, thanks to a 38-23 second quarter. A 29-20 third quarter is what really put the game away but Washington's 32-17 fourth quarter made the final scoreline look closer than it actually was. The Mavericks really dominated the shooting disparity, shooting 46 percent from the field while holding the Wizards to under 40 percent from the field. Getting to the free-throw line was also big, with Dallas hitting 27-of-33 and Washington connecting on 15-of-18. 

The Wizards (0-1) were led by Bradley Beal, as he tallied 19 points, six rebounds, nine assists and three steals despite going 1-of-11 from three-point range. Thomas Bryant amassed 14 points, 11 rebounds and three assists. Rui Hachimura totaled 14 points and 10 boards. Jordan McRae led the bench with 11 points, five rebounds and three assists.

Dorian Finney-Smith finished with 10 points and eight boards while Jalen Brunson led the bench with nine points, four rebounds, three assists and two assists.
