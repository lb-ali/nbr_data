												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 118-93, in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at Air Canada Center on Monday. 

This series has been competitive throughout, but this was a lopsided result in Toronto's favor. In fact, the Raptors led by 11 after the first quarter and the game never got within seven points from there. In addition, Toronto held a double-digit lead for the final 21 minutes. This was the Raptors best offensive performance of the series, as they shot 58 percent from the field, 44 percent from three-point range and 92 percent from the free-throw line. They also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle, 40-23.

The Bucks (2-3) simply dug themselves too big of a hole in this game, as they'll now have to win out to advance to the second-round. Giannis Antetokounmpo was a bright spot for Milwaukee, as he collected 30 points, nine rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks. Malcolm Brogdon was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 19 points, two rebounds and three assists. Khris Middleton accumulated eight points, three rebounds, six assists and five steals. Greg Monroe led the bench with 11 points, two rebounds and two assists.

The Raptors (3-2) are now just one win away from a berth in the second-round, as this was one of their best performances of the postseason thus far. Norman Powell got another start and provided 25 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals on 8-of-11 shooting. DeMar DeRozan amassed 18 points, three rebounds and six assists. Serge Ibaka finished with 19 points, six rebounds, three assists and three blocks. Kyle Lowry recorded a double-double, accruing 16 points, three rebounds, 10 assists and three steals.

												The host Atlanta Hawks took down the Washington Wizards, 111-101, in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at Philips Arena on Monday.  

The Hawks (2-2) have bounced back from a two-game hole, evening up the series with Monday's win.  It was a solid team effort to earn the win, as seven players scored in double figures.  Atlanta was the first team to achieve that feat in the 2017 playoffs.  The team was primarily led by veteran center Dwight Howard, who had a whopping 16-point, 15-rebound double-double.  Howard connected on a number of alley-oops, helping to swing momentum in Atlanta's favor.  All-Star forward Paul Millsap, who led the team to victory in Game 3, added a team-high 19 points along with nine rebounds and seven assists.  The Hawks will hope to keep momentum from their win as they leave their home court for Game 5.

Washington (2-2), meanwhile, has lost some of its momentum after dropping both games in Atlanta.  Many pegged Game 3's loss on a sub-par performance from star shooting guard Bradley Beal, but Beal bounced back nicely on Monday.  He led the team with 32 points, including five of the team's 11 three-pointers.  All-Star point guard John Wall also made a stellar contribution, scoring 22 point while dishing out a team-high 10 assists.  Wall did, however, have six turnovers, including two down the stretch as the Wizards attempted to come back.  

Game 5 will be in Washington on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 128-103 in Monday's Game 4 of their first-round playoff series at Moda Center. 

It didn't take long for Monday's contest to get out of hand, as just three and a half minutes into the game, the Warriors (4-0) had opened up a 14-0 lead and ultimately jumped out to a 28-5 lead over the first six minutes of the first quarter. From there, the Trail Blazers (0-4) struggled to get much closer, with Golden State set on ending this series on Monday night. Despite playing in just three quarters, Steph Curry was sensational, scoring a game-high 37 points in just 30 minutes while shooting 7-of-11 from behind the arc. Draymond Green was the only Warriors player who played more than 30 minutes, and in that time, he shot 7-of-11 from the field, scored 21 points, grabbed six rebounds, dished out four assists and blocked three shots. In the end, six different Golden State players scored in double figures as the team shot a scorching 53.5 percent from the field 58.6 percent from behind the arc. 

As for Portland, the same could not be said, as they shot a miserable 38.3 percent from the field overall in the 25-point loss. Despite the ugly game, Damian Lillard was still terrific, scoring a team-high 34 points on 12-of-24 shooting from the field in 41 minutes. His partner in the backcourt, C.J. McCollum, however, was not so terrific. McCollum capped off the first-round series with a 2-of-12 shooting performance from the field that led to him scoring just six points, and through three quarters, the shooting guard had been 0-of-9 from the field. Al-Farouq Aminu wound up putting together a solid performance, scoring 25 points in 35 minutes off the bench to go along with seven rebounds and two steals.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 106-102, in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday. 

Cleveland have been dominant all series and a sweep is just what they need to get some rest for the second-round. This game was close much like the rest of the series, as there were seven ties and five lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 13 points. The middle quarters were key, with Cleveland outscoring Indiana, 66-53, in the second and third quarters. Free-throw shooting was also huge, with the Cavaliers hitting 23-of-27 from the free-throw line and the Pacers going just 10-of-17. Cleveland also won the rebounding differential, 48-42.

The Cavaliers (4-0) looked lost headed into the postseason, but a first-round series sweep would indicate otherwise. LeBron James was once again the player of the game, as he collected 33 points, 10 rebounds, four assists, four steals and two blocks. Kyrie Irving tallied 28 points, two rebounds and three blocks. Kevin Love scored just five points on 2-of-13 shooting, but snatched down a game-high 16 rebounds. Deron Williams led the bench with 14 points on 4-of-4 from the field.

The Pacers (0-4) simply didn't have enough to compete with the champs and it was evident by this quick postseason exit. Lance Stephenson led Indiana, as he contributed 22 points, six rebounds and three assists off the bench. Paul George accumulated 15 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals. Myles Turner amassed 20 points and nine rebounds. Jeff Teague accrued 15 points, four rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and three blocks. Thaddeus Young recorded a double-double, scoring 13 points and grabbing 10 boards.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Oklahoma City Thunder, 113-109, in Game 4 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday.

Despite there being just five ties and six lead changes in this game, it was close throughout. In fact, it was a single-digit margin for the final 20 minutes with an extremely hectic finish. That's evident by the fact that there were nine combined steals and fouls in the final 90 seconds. The key for the Rockets was bench production, as they got 64 points and 25 rebounds from their three bench players, while the Thunder's five bench players combined for just 22 points and nine rebounds. Free-throw shooting was also huge, with Houston hitting 28-of-33 and Oklahoma City going just 18-of-32 from the charity stripe.

The Rockets (3-1) now have a commanding 3-1 series lead, as they are headed back home to try to end this series. Nene Hilario was the player of the game, as he provided 28 points and 10 rebounds on a perfect 12-of-12 shooting off the bench. Eric Gordon and Lou Williams were also spectacular off the bench, scoring 18 points a piece, while combing for 15 rebounds. James Harden collected 16 points, seven rebounds and eight assists, but committed seven turnovers on 5-of-16 from the field. Trevor Ariza totaled 14 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals. 

The Thunder (1-3) needed this win desperately with a 2-1 series deficit, but fell just shy in their home building. Russell Westbrook recorded another triple-double though, accumulating 35 points, 14 rebounds, 14 assists and three steals. Steven Adams amassed 18 points, seven rebounds, two assists and three blocks on 8-of-10 shooting. Victor Oladipo finished with 15 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Andre Roberson went just 2-of-12 from the free-throw line, but still accrued 13 points, four rebounds, two steals and five blocks.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls, 104-95, at United Center on Sunday evening in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs. The series is now tied 2-2.

The Celtics (2-2) had secured a likely series-salvaging victory on Friday evening, producing a dominating defensive performance in Game 3 at United Center. However, that was only half the battle, as Boston essentially needed to duplicate the same caliber of effort in Game 4 to ensure that they could head back to TD Garden with a deadlocked series. Isaiah Thomas and the defense were successfully able to generate an encore, with the star point guard scoring a game-high 33 points and supplementing them with seven assists, four rebounds and one steal, and Boston limiting the Bulls (2-2) to a 42.1 percent success rate from the field and 20.8 percent from three-point range.

Gerald Green drew another start -- a move by coach Brad Stevens that's proven prudent thus far -- and followed Thomas with 18 points and seven rebounds. Al Horford posted a 15-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included four assists, one steal and one block. Jae Crowder totaled 11 points, two rebounds, one assist and two steals. Kelly Olynyk led the bench with 10 points, three rebounds, one steal and one block.

Jimmy Butler matched Thomas shot for shot, pouring in 33 points and adding nine assists, five rebounds and one steal. Nikola Mirotic was a distant second with 13 points, seven rebounds, one assist and one steal. Isaiah Canaan led the bench by matching Mirotic's scoring total and also providing three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Dwyane Wade turned in 11 points, six boards, two assists, two blocks and one steal. Robin Lopez supplied eight points, seven boards and one block.

The series now shifts back to Boston, where Game 5 will unfold on Wednesday night.

												The host Utah Jazz took down the Los Angeles Clippers, 105-98, in Game 4 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Sunday.

Utah (2-2) saw its star big man, Rudy Gobert, return from a knee injury on Sunday.  After going down on the first possession of the series, many expected that the Jazz would be forced to go without Gobert for the duration of the series.  The French big man came back for a stellar showing on Sunday, however, as he delivered 15 points and 13 rebounds in just 24 minutes of play.  Gobert's return to the court was much-needed, as the Jazz were able to see only 10 minutes from All-Star forward Gordon Hayward.  Hayward left Sunday's playoff action due to food poisoning, according to team officials.  

Despite the lack of health for the team, Utah was able to earn its first home playoff victory since 2010.  One of the key factors for the Jazz was veteran wing Joe Johnson.  After hitting the game-winner in Utah's first victory last week, Johnson stepped up in Hayward's absence to deliver a team-high 28 points on 12-of-17 shooting.  Power forward Derrick Favors also made a big impact, shooting 7-of-10 for 17 points in just 24 minutes of action.

Los Angeles (2-2) has had its own fair share of bad luck.  A toe injury in Game 3 wound up putting an end to All-Star forward Blake Griffin's playoff campaign.  The Clippers still have their fair share of star power, however, with superstar Chris Paul continuing to step up in the playoffs.  Paul neared a triple-double on Sunday, scoring a team-high 27 points to go along with 12 assists and nine rebounds.  Sixth man Jamal Crawford, meanwhile, added 25 off the bench.  Griffin's absence stung for the Clippers, however, as rebounding was a major factor throughout.  Utah held a 42-31 advantage on the boards in the game.  

Game 5 will take place back in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 87-76, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Saturday afternoon in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs. The series is now tied 2-2.

Following a 104-77 drubbing in Game 3, the Raptors (2-2), and particularly DeMar DeRozan, had plenty of soul searching to do. Toronto was thoroughly dominated by the Bucks (2-2) defense, while the All-Star shooting guard had gone 0-for-8 from the floor and scored a series-low eight points. Whatever adjustments the Raptors made during their off-day Friday seems to have worked like a charm, as their defense gave plenty of what they got in Game 3, while DeRozan led all scorers with 33 points on 12-of-22 shooting. He added nine rebounds, five assists and four steals over his 40 minutes, doing a pretty fair impression of Milwaukee superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in the process. It was a thoroughly dominating performance on the defensive end as well, as the Bucks managed success rates of just 37.0 percent from the floor and 23.8 percent from three-point range while being forced into 20 turnovers.

Kyle Lowry followed his backcourt mate with 18 points, four rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block over a game-high 43 minutes. Norman Powell drew the start and posted 12 points, four rebounds, four assists and one block. Serge Ibaka started at center in a lineup shakeup and totaled 10 points, eight rebounds, one assist, three blocks and two steals. Jonas Valancinuas moved to the bench and led the second unit with 12 points, five rebounds and one steal. 

Tony Snell paced the Bucks with 19 points and four rebounds. Antetokounmpo provided 14 points, nine rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks. Greg Monroe matched Antetoknunmpo's scoring total and added nine rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block while leading the second unit. Khris Middleton posted a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and one steal. Thon Maker filled out the stat sheet with seven points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals.

The two teams reconvene for a pivotal Game 5 on Monday night at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the visiting Washington Wizards, 116-98, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs, at Philips Arena on Saturday evening, The Wizards lead the series 2-1. 

The Hawks started the game with a 19-4 run over the first six minutes and pushed the deficit up to 25, before finishing the first quarter up 38-20. They played solid defense at home, holding the Wizards to only 41.6 percent from the field, including 24.1 percent from long range, and maintained their lead throughout the game. The Hawks dominated the paint, where they out-scored the Wizards, 60-34. 

Paul Millsap was huge for Atlanta, as he led the way with 29 points on 12-of-20 shooting, 14 rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal, in 33 minutes. Dwight Howard only finished with five points on four shot attempts, but hauled in 11 rebounds, a steal, a block and two assists, in 27 minutes. Dennis Schroder came up big once again, with 27 points on 10-of-22 shooting and nine assists, in 31 minutes, while Taurean Prince gave the Hawks a nice boost with 16 points on 7-of-10 shooting. The Hawks shot 49 percent from the field, which is better than they did in Games 1 and 2, and also scored more points than they did in either of the first two games.

Meanwhile, the Wizards accumulated 16 assists as a team, but gave up an equalizing 16 turnovers. John Wall was just about the lone bright spot for Washington, as he led the way with 29 points and seven assists, in 32 minutes. On the other hand, Bradley Beal shot 6-of-20 from the field, including 0-of-6 from long range and finished with 12 points. The only other players to score in double digits for Washington were Brandon Jennings, with 13, and Bojan Bogdanovic, with 11. Otto Porter finished with seven points before he left the game late in the third quarter with a strained neck.

The Wizards were much better at home during the regular season but will need to find a way to win on the road in order to prevent the Hawks from tying it up at 2-2, in Game 4, which takes place in Atlanta on Monday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 110-108, in Game 4 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at FedEx Forum on Saturday. 

This was one of the tightest games of the postseason thus far, as it took an extra session to decide a winner. In fact, there were 11 ties and eight lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 10 points. Marc Gasol played hero, as he hit a game-winning floater with 0.7 seconds left in overtime to take a two-point lead and eventually win. Rebounding was key for Memphis, as they outrebounded San Antonio, 51-37. They also dominated the fastbreak points differential, winning that battle, 26-9. The Grizzlies ended up shooting 46 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range, while holding the Spurs to 42 percent from the field and 30 percent from long distance.

The Spurs (2-2) put in a valiant effort in this historic playoff game, but they fell just shy of taking a 3-1 series lead. Kawhi Leonard was incredible, as he scored a playoff career-high 43 points, to go along with eight rebounds, three assists and six steals. Tony Parker was vintage, tallying 22 points, four rebounds and five assists. LaMarcus Aldridge collected 13 points, two rebounds and two steals. Pau Gasol led the bench with eight points and 11 rebounds. 

The Grizzlies (2-2) needed this win avoid a 3-1 hole headed back to San Antonio and they showed some serious resiliency in this amazing game. Gasol not only hit the game-winner, he added 16 points, 12 rebounds and four assists to his line. Mike Conley was the Grizzlies best player, as he accumulated 35 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Zach Randolph recorded another double-double, totaling 12 points and 11 rebounds. Vince Carter started and accrued 13 points, three rebounds and two assists. JaMychal Green was huge off the bench, as he provided 14 points and four rebounds, in addition to manning up with Kawhi Leonard. 

Game 5 will be on Tuesday back in San Antonio.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Portland Trail Blazers, 119-113, in Game 3 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Moda Center on Saturday. 

This was a tale of two halves, as the Warriors really took care of business in the second half. In fact, the Blazers led, 67-54, at the half, but allowed the warriors to outscore them in the second half, 65-46. A 19-1 run spanning between the third and fourth quarters was key, as that gave Golden State their largest lead up to that point and eventually won them the game. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the glaring difference, with the Warriors recording 25 assists to just seven turnovers, while the Blazers committed 16 turnovers to 17 assists. A 22-6 advantage in fastbreak points was huge for Golden State as well.

The Warriors (3-0) had to play this game without Kevin Durant, but they find themselves now in command of this series. Stephen Curry was the player of the game, as he collected 34 points, four rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Klay Thompson finished with 24 points, two rebounds and three steals. Andre Iguodala was huge off the bench, providing 16 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Draymond Green accumulated nine points, eight rebounds, seven assists, two steals and six blocks. 

The Trail Blazers (0-3) played a great first half, but were unable to sustain that for all four quarters against the best team in basketball. C.J McCollum did all he could for Portland though, as he tallied 32 points, six rebounds and two steals. Damian Lillard was just as good, amassing 31 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Evan Turner totaled 17 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks. Al-Farouq Aminu and Noah Vonleh played well off the bench, combining for 24 points, 16 rebounds, five assists and two blocks.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Chicago Bulls 104-87 in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs, at United Center on Friday evening. The Bulls lead the series 2-1.

After dropping two games at home, the Celtics took a big step in the right direction with the road win.

Four of Boston's starters scored in double digits, including Jae Crowder and Isaiah Thomas, who finished with 16 points each. Al Horford was the high-point man for the Celtics with 18 points to go along with eight rebounds and six assists. Avery Bradley was solid with 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. 

Meanwhile, Dwyane Wade led the Bulls with 18 points on 6-of-18 shooting. Jimmy Butler followed up with 14 points and seven rebounds, while Robin Lopez finished with 12 points and six rebounds.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Houston Rockets, 115-113, in Game 3 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday.

Despite the fact that Oklahoma City led for all but one minute, this game was close throughout. In fact, this was a single digit margin for the entirety of the second half. All the statistics were lopsided in the Thunder's favor, as they ended up shooting 55 percent from the field and 47 percent from three-point range. Houston shot just 46 percent from the field and 29 percent from three-point range. Oklahoma City also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording 24 assists to 11 turnovers, while Houston committed 16 turnovers to just 10 assists. The Thunder also played well in transition, winning the fastbreak differential, 19-4.

The Rockets (2-1) did a great job of hanging around in a game where they didn't play well, but they fell just short of getting to a 3-0 lead. James Harden carried the load, as he accumulated 44 points, six rebounds and six assists. Lou Williams finished second on the team, dropping 22 points off the bench. Ryan Anderson was the only other starter with more than seven points, as he tallied 18 points and six rebounds. 

The Thunder (1-2) were in a must-win circumstance, as they rode some hot shooting to a huge Game 3 win. Russell Westbrook recorded his second-straight triple-double, collecting 32 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals. Taj Gibson finished second on the team, totaling 20 points and two rebounds on 10-of-13 from the field. Andre Roberson continued his great series, accruing 12 points, six rebounds, four assists, two steals and three blocks. Victor Oladipo finished with 12 points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Utah Jazz, 111-106, in Game 3 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Friday.  Los Angeles now has a 2-1 series lead.  

Despite the win, the Clippers received bad news during Friday's game.  All-Star big man Blake Griffin went down with a toe injury midway through the game. Griffin's x-rays did not show a break, but the star forward will miss at least Game 4 due to the injury.

Los Angeles (2-1) came back from down by double digits in the second half, going on an 11-0 run late in the fourth quarter to establish a lead.  The team was largely carried by superstar point guard Chris Paul, who had a team-high 34 points and 10 assists.  Paul was on fire on Friday, shooting 12-of-22 and scoring seven unanswered points with under six minutes remaining in the game.  Another crucial component for the Clippers was rebounding, as the team finished with a 41-27 advantage on the boards.  13 of those rebounds came from star big man DeAndre Jordan.

Utah (1-2) remains without star center Rudy Gobert, who went down with a knee injury on the first possession of the series.  On Friday, the Jazz enjoyed a step-up performance from All-Star forward Gordon Hayward.  Hayward had a game-high 40 points, including 25 in the first quarter.  However, Hayward also largely played Utah out of the game, committing three fourth quarter turnovers in the clutch and air-balling a late-game three-pointer.  Hayward was also responsible for throwing away the team's final inbounds pass.  

Game 4 is scheduled for Sunday in Utah.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers came back from down 26 to defeat the host Indiana Pacers, 119-114, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Thursday.  

The Cavaliers launched the largest comeback in playoff history on Thursday, coming back from down by 26 points at halftime.  Much of the comeback was due to strong play from superstar forward LeBron James.  James scored or assisted on 73 points, the most of his playoff career.  He finished the night with 41 points, 13 points, and 12 assists.  The performance moved him to seventh on the all-time playoff rebounding leader board.  

Cleveland (3-0) looks poised to move on to the semifinal round as it now holds a three-game lead over Indiana.  The Cavaliers saw three-point shooting prove key in their comeback win in Indiana on Thursday.  The team hit a whopping 21 three-pointers on the night, including six from LeBron James.  Their shooting was less stellar from the free-throw line, however, as the team went just 20-of-30 from the charity stripe.  Point guard Kyrie Irving also saw some struggles, shooting just 4-of-17 from the field for 13 points.  

Indiana (0-3) saw major output from superstar forward Paul George despite the losing effort.  George finished the night with 36 points and 15 rebounds along with nine assists.  The team also saw a stellar rebounding effort, holding a 52-40 advantage on the glass.  However, the team as a whole could not get it going from the field, shooting just 40 percent from the field.  

Game 4 will be in Indiana on Sunday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Toronto Raptors 104-77 Thursday in Game 2 of their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series at BMO Harris Bradley Center. 

It didn't take long for this game to open up, as a 15-0 run from the Bucks (2-1) to end the first quarter gave them a 20-point lead after 12 minutes, and the Raptors (1-2) managed to score just 12 points in those 12 minutes. From there, Milwaukee continued to poor it on offensively and stand tall defensively, as Toronto had just 46 points by the end of the third quarter. The Bucks shot a scorching 52.2 percent from behind the arc and 52.7 percent from the field overall. They also recorded six steals, four blocks and forced the Raptors into 15 total turnovers. It was business as usual for both Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo, with Middleton scoring a team-high 20 points in addition to seven assists, while Antetokounmpo recorded 19 points, eight rebounds and four assists. The two wings managed to shoot a combined 15-of-25 (60 percent) from the field. 

The Raptors' stars failed to be as effective, with DeMar DeRozan putting together his worst performance of this season. DeRozan shot 0-of-8 from the field in 31 minutes Thursday night, finishing with eight points after he went 8-of-8 from the free throw line. All-star point guard Kyle Lowry wasn't much better, as he shot 4-of-10 from the field and scored just 13 points in 35 minutes -- a point total that still somehow managed to lead the team. It was a forgetful night overall for Toronto, as they shot a dreadful 33.8 percent from the field in the blowout defeat. 

All hope is not lost for the Raptors, however, as they'll still have a chance to earn home-court advantage back when the teams play Game 4 in Milwaukee on Saturday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 105-94, in Game 3 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at FedEx Forum on Thursday. 

San Antonio looked dominant in the first two games of this series, but Memphis did a nice job of bouncing back and taking care of homecourt advantage. This game was close throughout the first half, as there were nine ties and 13 lead changes in those two quarters. Memphis actually led from there on out though, outscoring San Antonio in the third quarter, 31-17. The key for the Grizzlies was their defense, as they held the Spurs to just 47 percent shooting on only 72 shots. They did that while forcing 12 turnovers from San Antonio, with Memphis commiting just five on their end. The Grizzlies ended up shooting 51 percent from the field, which was their highest mark against the Spurs all season. Much of that damage was done in the paint, with Memphis winning that battle, 44-34. San Antonio also struggled from the free-throw line, going just 16-of-28. 

The Spurs (2-1) have rode their defense all season long, but it simply wasn't there in this game. Kawhi Leonard led the way for San Antonio, as he tallied 18 points, four rebounds and three assists. LaMarcus Aldridge was second on the team, totaling 16 points and 11 rebounds. The other three starters combined for just six points, six rebounds and no assists. 

The Grizzlies (1-2) needed this win desperately after two blowout losses and they are now just one home win away from evening up this series. Zach Randolph was brilliant in his starting role, amassing 21 points and eight rebounds. Mike Conley accrued 24 points and eight assists. Marc Gasol collected 21 points, six rebounds and three assists. 

This win snapped a nine-game losing streak for the Grizzlies in the postseason. This is the first time that Memphis has cracked 100 points in 14-straight playoff games.

Game 4 will be on Saturday back in Memphis.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 109-101, at Verizon Center on Tuesday night in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs. The Wizards now lead the series, 2-0.

The Hawks (0-2) had a hard time scoring points against the Wizards (2-0) over their last three meetings in the regular season, and those issues re-emerged in Tuesday's Game 2. The fact that standout center Dwight Howard ran into trouble certainly didn't help their cause either, nor did the 18 turnovers they were guilty of after committing 19 in Game 1. Shooting was a problem as well, as Atlanta could only muster a 40.5 percent success rate from the field and 20.0 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, the backcourt duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal were lethal, as they combined to score 63 points on a combined 21-of-47 from the field, including 6-of-12 from three-point range. Their contributions were key in Washington overcoming the 78-74 deficit they entered the final 12 minutes with, and in helping them put together a 35-point fourth quarter to seal the win. 

With Howard in foul trouble, Paul Millsap took on a more prominent role in the frontcourt and led the way for Atlanta with 27 points, 10 rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block. Dennis Schroder followed with 23 points, which he supplemented with six assists, four rebounds and one steal. Tim Hardaway, Jr. followed with 19 points, two assists and one rebound. Taurean Prince provided 12 points, four boards and one assist. Howard could only muster six points, seven rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block over 20 minutes. Kent Bazemore paced the second unit with eight points, five rebounds and two blocks.

Wall led the way for the Wizards with 32 points, nine assists, five rebounds, one steal and one block. Beal was right behind his backcourt mate with 31 points, which he complemented with three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Marcin Gortat posted a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists, five blocks and one steal. Much like Howard, Markieff Morris also ran into issues with the ref's whistle, totaling just three points, three rebounds, two assists and two blocks over 20 minutes. Brandon Jennings led the bench with 10 points, four rebounds and two assists. 

The two teams will reconvene on Saturday at Philips Arena for Game 3.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 115-111, in Game 2 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Toyota Center on Wednesday. 

Despite Oklahoma City leading for the majority of this game, Houston made the final run that ultimately proved to be decisive. In fact, the Thunder led 86-74 in the third quarter and allowed the Rockets to go off from there. In addition, Houston grabbed their first lead with only seven minutes left, as they won the fourth quarter, 29-22, en route to a comeback win. The Thunder actually turned a 12-point lead into a 10-point deficit in just 12 minutes of action between the third and fourth quarters. Oklahoma City dominated the stat sheet, as they won the rebounding, steals, blocks, fastbreak points and turnover differentials. Shooting was key for Houston, as they hit 49 percent of their shots, while holding the Thunder to just 41 percent from the field on their end. The Rockets also dominated in bench production, outscoring Oklahoma City's bench, 50-24.

The Thunder (0-2) dominated for most of this game, but they'll be going back home in a huge hole after a collapse in the fourth quarter. Russell Westbrook did all he could though, as he collected 51 points, 10 rebounds, 13 assists and four steals. He did however go 4-of-18 from the field in the fourth quarter and finished the game shooting just 17-of-43. Andre Roberson finished second on the team, accruing 12 points, eight rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Victor Oladipo totaled 11 points, nine rebounds and three assists.

The Rockets (2-0) were far from their best in this game, but they'll be leaving home with a dominant 2-0 advantage in this series. James Harden was once again the star, as he accumulated 35 points, four rebounds and eight assists. Patrick Beverley was the only other starter in double figures, as he tallied 15 points, six rebounds and four assists. Eric Gordon was huge off the bench, providing 22 points, four rebounds and two assists. Lou Williams dropped 21 points of his own off the bench in just 21 minutes of action.

Game 3 will be in Oklahoma City on Friday.

												The host Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 110-81, in Game 2 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Oracle Arena on Wednesday.  

Prior to the game, it was announced that Golden State star Kevin Durant would sit the game out due to a strained calf.  Warriors coach Steve Kerr defended the decision, saying he would ""feel like an idiot"" if Durant were to re-aggravate the injury.  Durant is officially listed as day-to-day and may rest again in Game 3 given the Warriors' comfortable cushion.  

Golden State (2-0) showed off its top-3 ranked defense throughout the game, holding Portland to just 33 percent shooting on the night.  With Durant sitting out and star players Steph Curry and Klay Thompson combining for just 35 points on 12-of-35 shooting, it was defense that proved key to earning the blowout win.  The team finished with eight steals and a whopping 11 blocks.  Four of those blocks came from bench big man JaVale McGee, who was superb in limited playing time.  McGee shot a perfect 7-of-7 from the field for 15 points.  

Portland (0-2) will head back to its home court in a fairly deep hole after dropping each of the first two games of the series by double figures.  After what was a miraculous first half for the Blazers' backcourt in Game 1, Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum went ice cold in Game 2, combining to shoot 9-of-34 for just 23 points. The team as a whole saw horrendous shooting splits, hitting just 33 percent of its shots from the field and 20 percent from beyond the arc.  

Game 3 will take place in Portland on Saturday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 106-100, at Air Canada Centre on Tuesday in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs. The series is now tied 1-1. 

The Raptors (1-1) came in with the sense of urgency that's unique to being in danger of going down 2-0 in a playoff series on one's home court. The Bucks (1-1) demonstrated once again that they are legitimate postseason players, seemingly staying with a more experienced Toronto squad shot for shot throughout all four quarters. However, it was the Raptors' experience and defense that appeared to give them an edge in the end. Kyle Lowry stayed on Giannis Antetokounmpo's hip on a late possession, forcing a pass despite the latter's considerable size advantage. The Raptors' point guard then coolly drained a 20-foot jumper over the tight coverage of Malcolm Brogdon to give the hosts some all-important breathing room at 104-100 with 8.9 seconds remaining. A missed Brogdon three-pointer and two Patrick Patterson free throws later, Toronto had effectively evened the first-round series at 1-1. 

Antetokounmpo paced Milwaukee with a 24-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included seven assists and two steals. Khris Middleton was next with 20 points, which he supplemented with five boards, two assists and one steal. Greg Monroe followed with a bench-leading 18 points, which he supplemented with four boards, one assist and one steal. Tony Snell poured in 14 points and added two rebounds. Brogdon mustered a modest seven points, four rebounds, three assists and one block. 

DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto with 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Lowry followed with 22 points, five assists, four rebounds, three steals and one block. Serge Ibaka provided 16 points, seven rebounds, six assists and a pair of blocks. Cory Joseph led the second unit with 11 points and added one assist. Jonas Valanciunas compiled a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double. DeMarre Carroll rounded out the starting five's productive night with nine points, one rebound, one assist and one block.

The two teams now head to BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee, where Game 3 will unfold on Thursday night.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Boston Celtics, 111-97, in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at TD Garden on Tuesday. 

A 2-0 start by the Celtics wouldn't have surprised anyone in this series, but the Bulls are the ones who holds that honor now. Chicago put in a dominant performance, as they led for over 40 minutes of this game and won each individual quarter by at least three points. Defense was key for the Bulls, as they recorded 12 steals and forced 16 turnovers from the Celtics. Shooting was also key, with Chicago shooting 51 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 79 percent from the free-throw line. Boston shot just 46 percent from the field, 30 percent from three-point range and 58 percent from the free-throw line.

The Bulls (2-0) now go back home with a two-game advantage, as they are on the verge of history as an eight-seed. Jimmy Butler was the player of the game, as he collected 22 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, four steals and two blocks. Dwyane Wade matched those 22 points, adding four rebounds and two assists to his tally. Rajon Rondo flirted with a triple-double, accumulating 11 points, nine rebounds, 14 assists and five steals Robin Lopez totaled 18 points, eight rebounds and two steals. Paul Zipser led the bench with 16 points.

The Celtics (0-2) are leaving home winless and they have dug themselves quite the hole headed back to Chicago. Isaiah Thomas once again led the way, as he accrued 20 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jae Crowder finished with 16 points, three rebounds and four assists. Marcus Smart played well off the bench, providing 13 points, eight rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Utah Jazz 99-91 in Game 2 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs Tuesday at Staples Center.

The Clippers (1-1) wasted no time opening up Tuesday's contest, holding a lead as large as 12 in the first quarter and ultimately ending the period with an 11-point advantage. From there, while the Jazz (1-1) managed to come close on multiple occasions throughout the next 36 minutes, they were never able to take the lead or even tie the game, as Los Angeles held from the lead from the very start at 2-0 to the very end. Chris Paul was sensational for the Clippers, making big shot after big shot down the stretch and finishing with 21 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the field and 10 assists in 33 minutes. Blake Griffin led the way scoring for Los Angeles with a game-high 24 points, while DeAndre Jordan was a monster on the glass, scoring 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting and grabbing 15 rebounds. As a team, the Clippers ended up shooting an impressive 52.4 percent from the field en route to tying the series.

For Utah, some timely three-pointers allowed them to hang around, with the team shooting 10-of-25 (40 percent) from the field overall, but they just didn't have enough offensively Tuesday night to comeback from an early deficit. Gordon Hayward scored a team-high 20 points, but he shot just 5-of-15 from the field. Game 1's hero Joe Johnson came off the bench to hit just six of his 15 shots en route to 13 points in 29 minutes, while George Hill added just 12 points of his own on a rough 5-of-12 shooting performance. In the end, the absence of Rudy Gobert (knee) on defense really hurt the Jazz in this contest, as the lack of size led to plenty of uncontested shots for the Clippers in the lane. 

The teams will play Game 3 on Friday in Salt Lake City.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 117-111, in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at Quicken Loans Arena on Monday. 

Cleveland haven't been dominant in either of the first two games, but they took care of business to go up 2-0 in this opening round. Despite this final scoreline being close, the Cavaliers were in control for the majority of the game. In fact, Cleveland led for the final three quarters, with the game never getting within four points after the first quarter. The third quarter is where they separated themselves, outscoring the Pacers, 33-20. Cleveland's offense was extremely efficient, shooting 55 percent from the field, 42 percent from three-point range and 87 percent from the free-throw line. 

The Pacers (0-2) have put in valiant efforts in both of these opening road games, but they're leaving Cleveland in a big hole. Paul George once again carried Indiana, as he collected 32 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Jeff Teague finished second on the team, accruing 23 points, four rebounds and four assists. Thaddeus Young totaled 16 points, three rebounds and six steals. Lance Stephenson was the only other Pacer in double figures, providing 13 points, two rebounds, four assists and two steals off the bench. 

The Cavaliers (2-0) now have a strangle hold on this series, as they took care of homecourt advantage. LeBron James was the player of the game, as he accumulated 25 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, four steals and four blocks. Kyrie Irving led the team in scoring, amassing 37 points, two rebounds and two assists. Kevin Love put up 27 points, 11 rebounds and three assists on an efficient 6-of-7 from the field. J.R. Smith had a recurrence of his hamstring injury and was unable to return in the second half. 

Game 3 will be on Thursday in Indiana.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 96-82, in Game 2 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs on Monday at AT&T Center. 

San Antonio took an early lead in the game but had to stave off a late comeback effort from Memphis.  Still, the number one-ranked defense of the Spurs factored in, as the team played stiflingly tight D on the Grizz to earn the win.  Memphis was held to just 37 percent shooting on the night and made only seven three-pointers, with shooting proving to be an obstacle in their comeback effort. 

The Spurs (2-0) were led by outstanding play from superstar forward Kawhi Leonard.  The former Finals MVP had a playoff career-high of 37 points on staggering 9-of-14 shooting from the field and 19-of-19 from the free-throw line.  He added a team-high 11 rebounds.  The win was hardly a one-man show, though, as San Antonio shot over 45 percent from the field and went a whopping 31-of-32 at the free-throw line as a team.  Guard Danny Green added a significant franchise milestone to his resume, as he passed Bruce Bowen for second in Spurs playoff three-pointers made with the 162nd made three-pointer of his playoff career.

Memphis (0-2) was put in a tough spot, falling behind by over 20 points in the second quarter.  Veteran point guard Mike Conley was one of the lone bright spots for the Grizzlies in the game, as he led the team with 24 points and eight assists with just one turnover.  Still, finding offense proved a struggle for the ""grit and grind"" Grizzlies.  The team went to the line only 15 times and hit just 37 percent of its shots from the field.  The team has now dropped its first two playoff games by a margin of 42 points.  

Memphis will host Game 3 on Thursday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 114-107, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference playoffs first-round at Verizon Center on Sunday. 

Despite the fact there were only two ties and two lead changes in total, this game was close throughout. In fact, it was a single-digit margin for nearly 40 minutes, with neither team leading by more than 15 points. It took a comeback for Washington to pull out Game 1, as they rode a 38-28 third quarter to overcome a halftime deficit. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the decisive statistic, with the Wizards recording 28 assists to 12 turnovers, while the Hawks committed 21 turnovers to just 18 assists.

The Hawks were one of the hottest teams in the league headed into the playoffs, but playing in Washington is a different animal. Dennis Schroder led the way for Atlanta, as he tallied 25 points, three rebounds and nine assists. Paul Millsap finished with 19 points and two rebounds. Dwight Howard scored just seven points, but brought down a game-high 14 rebounds. Kent Bazemore led the bench, providing 12 points, three rebounds and three assists. 

The Wizards struggled near the end of the season, but they're clearly comfortable with playing at home. John Wall was the player of the game, as he collected 32 points, four rebounds and 14 assists. Bradley Beal amassed 22 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Markieff Morris accumulated 21 points, seven rebounds, two assists and four blocks. Marcin Gortat recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points and 10 rebounds.

Game 2 will be back in Washington on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 121-109, in Game 1 of the Western Conference first-round playoff series at Oracle Arena on Sunday afternoon. Golden State has a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

The Warriors (1-0) came into the series knowing they'd finally have their Big Three of Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the floor together and at full strength to open the defense of their Western Conference championship. However, the sometimes forgotten man on the Golden State offense, the jack-of-all-trades Draymond Green, stepped up his offensive game considerably in the opening tilt of the first-round series. Green provided a near triple-double of 19 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, while adding five blocks and three steals in a superb all-around effort. Both of the latter contributions were game-high figures, and his defense helped spearhead a pivotal 15-2 run in the fourth quarter for the Warriors that subdued what had been a feisty Blazers (0-1) squad. Golden State finished with a 53.1 percent success rate from the floor and limited Portland to a 43 percent tally.

The Blazers were led by C.J. McCollum, who poured in 41 points and added eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. He took a whopping 28 shots on the afternoon, impressively draining 16. Backcourt mate Damian Lillard followed with 34 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. Evan Turner drew the start and posted a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and one steal. Moe Harkless managed 11 points, three boards, one assist, two steals and one block. Noah Vonleh couldn't contribute much on the offensive end, mustering just two points. He did haul in five rebounds and dished out four assists.

Durant paced the Warriors with 32 points, which he complemented with 10 rebounds, two assists and one block. Curry poured in 29 points and added five rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block. Thompson posted 15 points, three rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Ian Clark led the second unit with 12 points, two boards and one steal.

The two teams will reconvene at Oracle Arena for Game 2 on Wednesday night.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Boston Celtics, 106-102, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at TD Garden on Sunday. 

Boston had one of the worst records ever for a number-one seed and games like this show that they have a tough road ahead of them. Rebounding was the glaring difference in the game, with Chicago winning that battle, 53-36. They also got some great bench production, outscoring the Boston bench, 35-22. Free-throw shooting was also key, with the Bulls hitting 20-of-23 from the charity stripe, while the Celtics went just 14-of-19. It was a close game throughout, as there were 14 ties and 10 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by double-digits at any point.

The Bulls snuck into the playoffs thanks to their great rebounding and that was the key in this victory. Jimmy Butler was the player of the game, as he collected 30 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Bobby Portis was huge off the bench, providing 19 points, nine rebounds, three assists and two steals on 8-of-10 shooting. Robin Lopez recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points and 11 rebounds. Rajon Rondo accrued 12 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Dwyane Wade contributed 11 points, five rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks.

The Celtics have been dominated on the boards all season long and it was once again their downfall in this defeat. Isaiah Thomas carried Boston, as he tallied 33 points, five rebounds and six assists. Al Horford accumulated 19 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. Avery Bradley was the only other Celtic in double figures, as he amassed 14 points, three rebounds, two assists and three steals. 

Game 2 will be back in Boston on Tuesday.

												The host Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder, 118-87, in Game 1 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Toyota Center on Sunday. 

The series was hotly anticipated due to the marquee matchup between two of the leading contenders for the MVP award, Houston's James Harden and OKC's Russell Westbrook.  Harden was able to lead the league in assists throughout the regular season while taking the unexpectedly hot Rockets to third in the Western Conference.  Westbrook, meanwhile, broke the historic record of 41 triple-doubles set by Oscar Robertson over 50 years prior.  He did so while also earning the title of league scoring champion.  

On Sunday, the two squared off in their first postseason matchup, and the battle was fairly lopsided.  Though Westbrook posted strong individual numbers, including 22 points and 11 rebounds, Harden and the Rockets rolled by OKC as Harden scored a ridiculous 37 points.  Harden also outperformed Westbrook in terms of managing the ball, turning it over just twice while Westbrook coughed the ball up nine times in total.

For Houston as a whole, the series got off to an ideal start.  The team shot almost 50 percent and shut the Thunder down on the defensive end en route to a 31-point victory.  Houston's starting backcourt combined for 58 points and seven three-pointers.  They also saw an impressive performance from their bench, as the bench combined for 38 points, including 15 from veteran big man Nene Hilario.  

OKC, meanwhile, saw a miserable start to their playoff campaign.  The team struggled to contain superstar James Harden, often being forced into undesirable defensive matchups with the potential MVP.  In particular, big man Enes Kanter appeared to struggle with the matchup, which he ended up forced into numerous times.  Struggles were compounded by shooting woes, as the team hit only 37 percent of its attempts from the field.  

Game 2 will be in Houston on Wednesday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers, 109-108, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs Saturday at Quicken Loans Arena.

Two teams that know each other's strengths and weaknesses put on a show to open the postseason, with superstars LeBron James and Paul George matching each other virtually shot-for-shot in a tightly-contested showdown. The Pacers put a scare into the Cavs as time wound down after entering the fourth quarter trailing 94-84. Indiana outscored Cleveland 24-17 over the final 12 minutes and after a George three-pointer with 40 seconds remaining, had a chance to steal what would have been a huge series-opening victory. However, C.J. Miles' 14-foot jumper with less than a second on the clock couldn't find the net, allowing the defending champions to escape with the win.

George led the way for the Pacers with 29 points, seven assists, five rebounds and one steal. Lance Stephenson, a late-season addition that's paid some dividends, followed with 16 points, seven boards and three assists. Jeff Teague pitched in with 15 points, four assists and two rebounds. Myles Turner and Monta Ellis turned in matching 11-point efforts, with the former adding eight rebounds, one assists, four steals and one block, and the latter supplying four boards, one assist and one steal. Thaddeus Young mustered a modest eight points but posted nine rebounds and four assists.

James paced the Cavs with 32 points, 13 assists, six rebounds and three steals. Kyrie Irving registered 23 points, six assists, three rebounds, two steals and one block. Kevin Love managed 17 points, four rebounds, one assist and two blocks. Channing Frye produced a bench-leading 11 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds and two assists. Tristan Thompson pitched in with eight points, 13 rebounds and one assist.

The two teams reconvene on Monday night in Cleveland for Game 2.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Toronto Raptors, 97-83, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs at Air Canada Center on Saturday evening. 

The Bucks wasted no time, as they came out strong with a 30-22 first quarter. The Raptors answered by outscoring the Bucks 29-16 in the second quarter, to take a 51-46 lead into halftime. The second half started out the same way the first half did, with a strong third quarter from the Bucks, however the Raptors were not able to produce the counter punch, and were outscored 51-32 over the third and fourth quarters. The young Bucks team stole Game 1 from the third-place Raptors, instantly putting a big question mark on the series. It is not panic time yet though for Toronto, as the Raptors have now dropped Game 1 in the first round of the playoffs nine times in a row, dating back to 2002. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee with 28 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block, in 38 minutes. The rookie, Malcolm Brogdon came up huge for the Bucks with 16 points, six rebounds and two assists, in 34 minutes. Greg Monroe provided a big boost off the bench, with 14 points and a huge 15 rebounds, in 26 minutes. 

Meanwhile, the Raptors were slowed by the Bucks' solid defense, shooting only 36.0 percent from the field, including 21.7 percent from long range. DeMar DeRozan led the way with 27 points on 7-of-21 shooting, and eight rebounds, in 39 minutes, while Serge Ibaka followed up with 19 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks, in 36 minutes. Kyle Lowry struggled, shooting only 2-of-11 from the field, including 0-of-6 from downtown, on his way to four points, six assists and two rebounds, in 34 minutes.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 111-82, in Game 1 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at AT&T Center on Saturday.

San Antonio were heavy favorites in this series and they left very little doubt with this dominating victory. This game was actually close throughout the first half, with San Antonio taking control in the second half. In fact, the Spurs outscored the Grizzlies in the second half, 62-33. Defense was key for San Antonio, as they held Memphis to 39 percent from the field and 35 percent from long distance. The Spurs ended up shooting 53 percent from the field, as well as from three-point range. Rebounding was key as well, with San Antonio winning that battle, 43-35.

The Grizzlies fought hard in the first half, but got obliterated in the second half. Marc Gasol carried Memphis, as he tallied 32 points, five rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Mike Conley was the only other starter with more than five points, as he collected 13 points, five rebounds, seven assists and three steals. Zach Randolph really struggled off the bench, as he totaled just six points and three rebounds on 3-of-13 shooting. 

The Spurs have been riding their defense all season and stifling performances like this show why. Kawhi Leonard was the player of the game, as he accumulated 32 points, three rebounds, five assists and two steals on 11-of-14 shooting. LaMarcus Aldridge finished second on the team, amassing 20 points, six rebounds and two assists, Tony Parker finished with 18 points, two rebounds and two assists.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Los Angeles Clippers, 97-95, in Game 1 of the Western Conference first-round playoffs at Staples Center on Saturday. 

These two teams finished with even 51-31 records and if this games any indication, this will be one of the tightest series of the playoffs. In fact, there were six ties and 11 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than eight points. Joe Johnson was the hero, as he hit the game-winning floater at the buzzer to pull out the win. What really carried the Jazz was their three-point shooting, as they hit 8-of-19 from long range, while Los Angeles went just 8-of-24. Bench production was a huge factor as well, with the Jazz' bench outscoring the Clippers bench, 47-15.

The Jazz lost Rudy Gobert due to a knee sprain in the opening minute, but escaped with an impressive road win. Johnson was the player of the game, as he provided 21 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals off the bench, in addition to the game-winner. Gordon Hayward totaled 19 points, 10 rebounds and three assists. George Hill started at point guard and collected 16 points, four rebounds and two assists. Derrick Favors was also a nice spark off the bench, accruing 15 points, six rebounds and two assists. 

The Clippers had been dominant against the Jazz over recent seasons, but this close-fought battle indicate a new era. Chris Paul was the Clippers best player, as he accumulated 25 points, seven rebounds, 11 assists and three steals. Blake Griffin led the team in scoring, amassing 26 points, seven rebounds and three assists. DeAndre Jordan recorded a double-double, contributing 10 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Detroit Pistons, 113-109, at Amway Center on Wednesday evening.

The Magic (29-53) checked into the regular-season finale looking to finish the season on an up note after losing seven of their previous eight games. They got off to a magnificent start in that regard with a 38-point first quarter, but the Pistons (37-45) clawed their way back throughout the game. Ultimately, it was stellar shooting (48.3 percent from field, 52.0 percent from three-point range) for Orlando and a trio of triple-doubles from Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton that spearheaded the much-needed win.

Ish Smith and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the way for the visitors with matching 20-point efforts, with the former adding 10 assists and four rebounds and the latter supplying four rebounds and one steal. Reggie Bullock followed with a bench-leading 17 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Boban Marjanovic contributed a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double in 21 minutes that also included three blocks and one steal. Henry Ellenson tallied 12 points, six rebounds, one assist and one steal in 19 minutes. Andre Drummond managed nine points but also hauled in 14 rebounds and dished out two assists. 

Aaron Gordon paced Orlando with a 32-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included two blocks and one steal. Elfrid Payton registered a 21-point, 13-assist double-double along with five boards. Nikola Vucevic provided an 18-point, 11-rebound double-double that also featured an assist, two steals and two blocks. Evan Fournier contributed 12 points, three rebounds and two assists. Jodie Meeks led the bench with 12 points and one assist.

With Wednesday's win, the Magic secured a 3-1 season victory in the series.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 98-83, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday night.

The Raptors (51-31) gave the likely exhausted DeMar DeRozan the night off for the season finale with playoff seeding secured. As has been the case in past games when DeRozan has sat, Norman Powell stepped into the starting five and excelled against a Cavaliers (51-31) team sitting LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving despite the top seed in the Eastern Conference being within reach. Powell tallied a game-high 25 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Kyle Lowry posted 13 points, four assists, two rebounds and one steal. Jonas Valanciunas matched Lowry's scoring total and added seven rebounds, one assist and one steal. Bruno Caboclo led the bench with 11 points, four rebounds, one assist and one block.

The Cavs were led by a modest 11-point effort from Iman Shumpert that was complemented by three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Deron Williams followed with 10 points, four assists and three rebounds. Tristan Thompson matched Williams' scoring total and added four rebounds and one steal. Derrick Williams led the bench with 10 points as well, and added four rebounds and three assists. Dahntay Jones and James Jones contributed matching nine-point efforts as reserves as well, with the former providing two rebounds and one assist and the latter compiling six boards, two assists and one block.

Despite the Toronto win Wednesday, the Cavs easily triumphed in the season series by a 3-1 margin. Cleveland will enter the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, while Toronto will be slotted third.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 112-94, at TD Garden on Wednesday night.

The mission Wednesday night for the Celtics (53-29) couldn't have been any clearer: win and there was a high probability that the East's top seed was theirs, considering the Cleveland Cavaliers were resting their Big Three against the Toronto Raptors. That made Boston's first-quarter performance all the more maddening, as they fell behind 36-25 in the first 12 minutes despite the Bucks (42-40) resting Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, among others. The Celtics righted the ship after that point, however, taking a 57-56 lead into halftime. After a tightly-contested third quarter, Boston pulled away in the fourth by doubling up their visitors, 32-16. They featured a balanced attack that overcame a poor shooting night from Isaiah Thomas, as six players managed double-digit scoring.

Michael Beasley and Spencer Hawes co-led the Bucks with 15-point efforts from the starting five and bench, respectively. Beasley added five rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks, while Hawes contributed five rebounds and two assists. Rashad Vaughn pitched in with 14 points, four assists, three rebounds, two steals and one block. Malcolm Brogdon posted 11 points, five boards, three assists, one steal and one block. Greg Monroe was productive as a reserve as well with 10 points, six rebounds and four assists, while Thon Maker totaled nine points, six boards, three assists and three blocks. 

Gerald Green actually paced the Celtics with 18 points, six rebounds and one assist in 21 minutes off the bench. Amir Johnson and Jae Crowder supplied matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block, and the latter registering five boards, two assists and three steals.

Jaylen Brown amassed 10 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal in 22 minutes off the bench. 

With Wednesday's win, the Celtics claimed the season series, 2-1. Boston will enter the postseason as the top dog in the East, while the Bucks will be the No. 6 seed.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 114-113, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night.

The Knicks (31-51) got a surprise entrant into their starting five when Carmelo Anthony, who had missed the previous two games with a sore knee, decided to play in what could be his final game in a New York uniform. The All-Star excelled during his time on the court, posting a first unit-leading 17 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, one assist and one steal over just 23 minutes. The game between the two long-eliminated teams was competitive throughout, and fittingly, came down to the final seconds. Maurice Ndour, who has provided some encouraging performances in the last several games, made a two-point shot with 18 seconds remaining to give the Knicks the 114-113 lead. The Sixers (28-54) then saw Nik Stauskas twice try to help them take the lead, both times to no avail; his layup with seven seconds remaining was blocked by Marshall Plumlee, and his 25-foot three-point jumper at the buzzer misfired as well, sealing the win for the home squad. Both teams shot very well, with Philadephia managing a 50.5 percent success rate and New York draining 51.3 percent of their attempts. The Knicks were the sloppier squad, however, turning the ball over 20 times on the night.

Justin Anderson led the visitors with 26 points and added three assists, two rebounds, three steals and one block. He impressively missed just one of the 10 shots he took. Alex Poythress provided 18 points, six rebounds, one assist and one steal. Richaun Holmes totaled 15 points, seven boards and one steal. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot posted 14 points, three assists and two rebounds. Tiago Splitter and Stauskas led the bench with matching 12-point efforts.

Justin Holiday actually led the Knicks off the bench with 20 points, five rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Plumlee pitched in with a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included the aforementioned block of Stauskas. Chasson Randle managed 12 points, three rebounds and two steals off the bench. Mindaugas Kuzminskas became the fourth member of the second unit with double-digit scoring by pouring in 11 points, which he complemented with four rebounds. No other member of the starting five besides Anthony posted double-digit scoring, but Ron Baker and Courtney Lee had eight points apiece, while Willy Hernangomez mustered seven points but also hauled in 10 boards and dished out three assists in only 18 minutes.

With Wednesday's win, the Knicks ensured a 2-2 split of the season series, with both of their wins having come by one point each.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Washington Wizards, 110-102, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday.

Miami needed a win here and some help to reach the postseason and they did their portion, but still missed out due to a Chicago win. The middle quarters were key for Miami, as they outscored Washington, 68-50. Rebounding is what carried the Heat to a victory, as they outrebounded the Wizards, 51-34. It wasn't just the rebounding, as they also outscored Washington in the paint, 60-46.

The Wizards (49-33) were locked into the four-seed in the east prior to this game, so this loss is far from an issue for this title contender. Trey Burke led the way for Washington, as he provided 27 points on 10-of-13 shooting off the bench. Marcin Gortat led the starters, as he totaled 16 points and five rebounds. Sheldon McClellan played well off the bench too, dropping 18 points in a career-high 34 minutes. 

The Heat (41-41) did an amazing job of getting back to .500, but they fell just short of a playoff berth. In fact, they finished the season on a 30-11 run to tie for the eight-seed in the east, but they fell shy due to a tiebreaker to the Chicago Bulls. Goran Dragic led the way for Miami, as he accrued 28 points, four rebounds and five assists. Hassan Whiteside amassed 24 points and 18 rebounds. James Johnson flirted with a triple-double, collecting 12 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-73, at United Center on Wednesday. 

This game meant much more to Chicago than Brooklyn and a 39-point margin shows just that. It was a wire-to-wire win for the Bulls, as they led by 14 after the first quarter and ended up winning the fourth quarter, 37-17, to pull away in dominating fashion. Three-point shooting was a glaring difference, with Brooklyn hitting just 3-of-33 and Chicago going 14-of-30. Rebounding was a huge factor as well, with Chicago winning that battle, 62-48. It was the Bulls defense that was especially feisty, as they held Brooklyn to 33 percent shooting and that aforementioned ugly three-point total.

The Nets (20-62) played this game without most of their starters and that was evident by this final scoreline. Archie Goodwin was Brooklyn's best player, as he provided 20 points, seven rebounds and four assists. K.J. McDaniels finished second on the team, dropping 15 points and six rebounds off the bench as well. Caris LeVert was the only starter in double figures, as he totaled 10 points, five rebounds and two assists. 

The Bulls (41-41) needed this win to clinch a playoff berth and they did it in dominating fashion. Jimmy Butler was the player of the game, as he tallied 25 points, six rebounds, four assists, four steals and two blocks. Paul Zipser finished second on the team, amassing 21 points and six rebounds off the bench. Bobby Portis recorded a double-double off the bench as well, accruing 12 points and 10 rebounds.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 100-93, at FedEx Forum on Wednesday.

This game meant very little for both of these teams, but it was still a close game. In fact, this matchup was a single-digit margin for over 45 minutes. The key for Dallas was defense, as they held Memphis to 39 percent from the field and 32 percent from three-point range. It took a late run by the Mavericks to comeback, as they outscored the Grizzlies, 30-19, in the fourth quarter. 

The Mavericks (33-49) had nothing to play for here, but they ended the season on a good note with this upset win. Nicolas Brussino led the way, as he tallied 15 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals in a rare start, Devin Harris matched those 15 points, adding eight assists off the bench. Dwight Powell went just 2-of-11 from the field, but still finished with 11 points and three rebounds.

The Grizzlies (43-39) didn't have anything to play for here and it was evident by this bad loss. Mike Conley led the team in scoring despite playing just 17 minutes, as he collected 15 points, two rebounds and two assists.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 123-118 Wednesday at Toyota Center. 

The final score of Wednesday's contest suggests the game was a lot closer than it actually was, as while the team entered halftime tied up at 60 points each, the Rockets (55-27) elected to run away with the game in the third period, outscoring the Timberwolves (31-51) by 14 points and holding a lead as large as 17. Minnesota attempted to inch their way back into the game over the course of the final 12 minutes, but they eventually just ran out of time. James Harden led the way with yet another triple-double to end the season, as he finished with a team-high 27 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in 35 minutes. Clint Capela added a double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds, while Ryan Andersen added 20 points of his own on a night where the Houston starters weren't expected to play a full load. In the end, they ended up accounting for 94 of the team's 123 points. 

As for the Timberwolves, with Wednesday's loss, they end their year on a six-game losing streak and are now tied for the sixth-worst record in the NBA. Karl-Anthony Towns capped off a terrific individual season with yet another terrific individual performance, finishing with a game-high 28 points and 21 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins added 21 points of his own, while Shabazz Muhammed contributed in a big way off the bench, finishing with 22 points in just 22 minutes as a reserve. As a team, it was a superb shooting performance from Minnesota, as they hit 52.7 percent of their field goal attempts. They just gave a lackluster defensive effort in their final outing of the 2016-17 season.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 111-105 Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

Wednesday's battle ended up being a battle between a team that only played seven players and a team that was contempt with where they were before the start of the postseason. The Nuggets (40-42) were the former, and the difference in the matchup ended up simply being that Denver had Nikola Jokic and their counterparts didn't. Jokic topped off a breakout season with another tremendous all-around game, posting 29 points, 16 rebounds and eight assists in 40 minutes. The Nuggets' other young star, Jamal Murray, also had a great game to close out a strong rookie campaign, scoring 27 points of his own in 41 minutes. In the end, it was Denver's ability to get fouled and to the free throw line that ultimately led them to victory, as they got to the line 32 times and hit 26 of those attempts. 

As for the Thunder (47-35), while four of their five regular starters were active, none of them ended up playing a full load of minutes. Most notably, Russell Westbrook played just 18 minutes, and in that time, he shot 2-of-10 from the field en route to scoring five points, but he did manage to dish out eight assists and grab five rebounds. Five Oklahoma City players scored in double figures, but the highest total ended up being just 13 points from both Taj Gibson and Jerami Grant. It wasn't a game the Thunder were particularity interested in winning or losing, hence why all 13 active players saw the floor for at least 10 minutes despite the game being close down the stretch. The Thunder will now move onto their first-round playoff matchup against the No. 3 seeded Rockets.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Atlanta Hawks 106-84 Wednesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 

The Pacers (42-40) came into Wednesday's game with their playoff hopes cleanly laid out for them: they win and they're in. Fortunately for them, they were going against a Hawks (43-39) team that rested all of their key players after clinching the No. 5 seed with a win on Monday. The result was a beat down from Indiana, as they essentially led the game wire-to-wire on the back of their star, Paul George. George finished with a game-high 32 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes, as the potential All-NBA performer left it all on the floor when his team needed him to the most. Jeff Teague added 19 points and seven assists but left late in the game after coming down awkwardly on his ankle. His status will likely be updated over the course of the next couple of days. 

As for the Hawks, they had nothing to play for and will be well-rested before their first-round series against the Wizards starts. In the starter's absence, Ersan Ilyasova led the way with 15 points in just 18 minutes, as he was essentially rested prior to the postseason as well. Overall, it was an ugly game for the depleted Atlanta squad, as the 86 points was their lowest point total in five games. And it wasn't because they shot the ball poorly necessarily, but rather, they failed to take care of the basketball, as they committed 18 turnovers to just 19 team assists. Nevertheless, while the loss ended a four-game winning streak, the Hawks will still enter the playoffs with plenty of momentum.

												In their regular season finale, the host Utah Jazz took down the San Antonio Spurs, 101-97.

The Jazz (51-31) will finish the season with the fourth seed in the Western Conference and a tie for the league's fifth-best record.  On Wednesday, they finished out their strong season on a high note, shooting over 50 percent and dealing a loss to the second-seeded Spurs.  Star center Rudy Gobert once again made a big impact, scoring 13 points, shooting 5-of-9, and coming down with nine rebounds.  The high scorer for the team was All-Star forward Gordon Hayward, who had only 14 points but earned them in just 22 minutes of playtime.  

San Antonio (61-21) will see no real consequences for losing the game on Wednesday, as it has been locked into the second seed for weeks.  Still, coach Greg Popovich played All-Star forward LaMarcus Aldridge for over 34 minutes in the game, allowing him to total a game-high 18 points.  It was a relatively mediocre night for the Spurs on Wednesday, as the team turned it over 15 times and made only eight three-pointers.  The team likely won't sweat the four-point loss, though; San Antonio is finishing the season with the number one defense and the number seven offense in the NBA, and holds the second-best record of any team in the association.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers blew out the Sacramento Kings, 115-95, in the final game of the regular season.  

The Clippers (51-31) secured home court advantage in their first playoff series with their win on Wednesday.  The blowout was a major occasion for LA, as it saw veteran Paul Pierce step on the court for the final time in the regular season.  Pierce saw just one minute of action after he enjoyed a fourth quarter earlier in the week in which he passed John Havlicek for 15th on the all-time scoring list.  The younger Clippers, meanwhile, won in emphatic fashion.  Six players scored in double figures as the team shot almost 52 percent from the field.  Center DeAndre Jordan led the team with 18 points, 17 rebounds, and four blocks.  

The Kings (32-50) closed what was a season of massive organizational change with a blowout loss, though the team was in no need of a win on Wednesday.  Sacramento should be looking at two lottery picks in the upcoming NBA draft after trading center DeMarcus Cousins and missing the Western Conference playoffs.  The Kings' future looked bright despite the loss on Wednesday, though, as rookie Buddy Hield continued to play well.  Hield scored 16 points to go with six rebounds and four assists.  Sophomore Willie Cauley-Stein added strong play of his own, finishing with 19 points, 14 rebounds, and six assists.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the Los Angeles Lakers in their season finale on Wednesday, 109-94.

Golden State (67-15) has now won at least 67 games in three consecutive seasons, good for the league's best record once again.  The Warriors finished their season strong, winning 15 of their final 16.  Recently-injured superstar Kevin Durant played his third game since returning from injury on Wednesday and looked very much like himself, scoring 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting along with eight rebounds and five assists.  It was a fairly typical Warriors win, as the team dominated every area of the game.  Golden State finished with a 14-rebound advantage, made 12 three-pointers, and dished out 28 team assists.  They will be gearing up to play Portland in the first round of the playoffs.

Los Angeles (26-56) will finish the season with the league's third-worst record.  The Lakers will enter the offseason in a lofty position, as there is a 56 percent chance that they will end up ceding their first-round draft pick to Philadelphia based on the results of the draft lottery.  LA needs its pick to land in the top 3 to maintain ownership.  On Wednesday, the team saw a defeat that was a microcosm of their season.  The team struggled to ever truly find its groove, turning the ball over 18 times and trailing by double digits for the majority of the game.  However, five players did manage to score in double figures.

												The visiting New Orleans Pelicans squeaked by the Portland Trail Blazers in their season finale on Wednesday, 103-100.

New Orleans (34-48) allowed their two All-Star big men, Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, to rest on Wednesday.  The team still played strong basketball, seeing its young players step up to fill the void.  Rookie big man Cheick Diallo led the team with a career-high 16 rebounds in 29 minutes of play.  He added 12 points on 4-of-5 shooting.  The team played extremely well on the defensive end, pressuring the Blazers into numerous turnovers.  The Pelicans ended with 13 steals on the night.  The Pelicans did not make the Western Conference playoffs and will be ceding their first-round pick to the Sacramento Kings unless it lands in the top three.  

Portland (41-41) rested its own star players in preparation for the playoffs.  Guards Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum each sat, paving way for bench players and prospects to dominate the game.  Backup point guard Shabazz Napier enjoyed a career night, scoring a game-high 25 points on 10-of-18 shooting.  Third-year big man Noah Vonleh also had a strong night, finishing with a game and career-high 19 rebounds along with 12 points to complete a double-double.  The Blazers will be facing the league-best Golden State Warriors in round one of the playoffs.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 103-76, at Philips Arena on Tuesday night.

The Hawks (43-28) came into Tuesday's contest knowing they held their fate in their own hands with respect to the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. With a victory over a short-handed Hornets (36-46) squad that had nothing except spoiler aspirations remaining, Atlanta was guaranteed the spot. They made sure to take care of business from early on, jumping out to a 38-26 first-quarter lead and expanding their advantage to 63-44 by halftime. With the double-digit edge, no Hawks starter had to play more than 26 minutes and an eight-man second unit combined for 49 points. Atlanta posted a 51.9 percent success rate from the field while limiting Charlotte to 33 percent.

The Hornets bench also had a productive night and Jeremy Lamb actually led all scorers on the night with 21 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, one assist and two steals. Briante Weber and Treveon Graham contributed 10 points apiece off the second unit as well, with the former adding three assists and one steal and the latter supplying four rebounds, one assist and two steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist matched their scoring total and provided six rebounds, one assist and one steal. Marvin Williams totaled seven points, six rebounds  and two steals.

Dwight Howard led the way for Atlanta with a 19-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included one assist and one block. Paul Millsap was next with 10 points and seven rebounds.

Taurean Prince also had eight points and complemented them with one rebound, one assist and one steal. Kent Bazemore and Mike Muscala had matching eight-point contributions off the bench as well.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 100-98, at Target Center on Tuesday. 

In a game that meant very little for both teams, they left it all on the floor in this close-fought battle. Victor Oladipo was the hero, as he hit a game-winning jumper with six seconds left to boost the Thunder to a win. There were seven ties and 18 lead changes in total, as this game was within a five-point margin for the final 18 minutes. Rebounding was the decisive statistic, with Oklahoma City winning that battle, 54-35. Bench production was big for the Thunder as well, as they outscored the Timberwolves bench, 38-20.

Domantas Sabonis started and totaled 19 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Steven Adams accrued 10 points, eight rebounds, two steals and two blocks.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 109-91, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday. 

This game was meaningless in terms of playoffs, but it secured the season series win for the Nuggets. Shooting was key, with Denver hitting 49 percent of their shots, while holding Dallas to under 40 percent from the field. The Nuggets also took care of the boards, winning the rebounding differential, 53-42. Denver also got some nice production out of their bench, outscoring the Mavericks bench, 47-34.

The Nuggets (39-42) just got knocked out of the playoffs in their most recent loss, but they're still fighting hard to get closer to .500. Gary Harris was the player of the game, as he collected 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Jamal Murray started at point guard and accrued 10 points, two rebounds and 10 assists. Mason Plumlee finished with 16 points and nine rebounds. Malik Beasley led the bench with 16 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 108-96 Tuesday at Staples Center. 

The supposedly tanking Lakers (26-55) have now won five straight games following Tuesday nights's wire-to-wire performance, as after the home team was losing for majority of the first quarter until Larry Nance hit a three-pointer at the buzzer that put them up 26-25. From that point on, the Lakers never lost the lead and continued to build on the lead until the final buzzer. In what was likely his final game at Staples Center, Metta World Peace led the team in scoring with 18 points on 7-of-17 shooting in just 25 minutes. In all, Los Angeles had six different players score in double figures, as they have now scored at least 100 points in seven of their last eight games. The five game winning streak gives them plenty of momentum heading into their season finale against the Warriors on Wednesday. 

As for the Pelicans (33-48), they've been trending in the complete opposite direction and Tuesday's performance was yet another example, as the loss was the team's fifth straight. This is the second straight game they have played without both DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis, and New Orleans has missed their production immensely. However, in their absence Tuesday, rookie Cheick Diallo emerged off the bench for a game-high 19 points and 11 rebounds in 27 points for what was his second double-double of the season. Jrue Holiday and Alexis Ajinca each added 14 points, but in the end, the Pelicans lacked the necessary star power to overcome the streaking Lakers. New Orleans will have one last opportunity Wednesday to end their losing streak when they take on the Trail Blazers in Portland.

												The host Sacramento Kings steamrolled the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, 129-104.  

Sacramento (32-49) enjoyed perhaps its best and most promising outing of the season on Tuesday as the team earned a blowout win.  An incredible eight players scored in double digits as the Kings rode their offense to an easy victory.  The Kings saw a career-high 30 points from rookie Buddy Hield, who became just the second member of the 2016 draft class to score 30 after teammate Skal Labissiere did the same a month earlier.  It was simply a beautiful night on the offensive end for Sacramento, as the team shot almost 52 percent from the floor while dishing out 28 assists.  Veteran point guard Ty Lawson helped run the offense with an impressive 22 points, 12 assists, and 11 rebounds, good for his first triple-double of the 2016-17 season.  

Phoenix (24-58) clinched the league's second-worst record with the loss.  While that may be good news for their lottery pick, the team's play on Tuesday was anything but positive.  The Suns shot only 37 percent from the field and 58 percent from the free-throw line.  Phoenix's own rookie had an impressive game, as Tyler Ulis dropped 27 points and dished out six assists.  However, Ulis was not nearly enough to get the job done on Tuesday.  The team was manhandled in just about every aspect of the game, including rebounding, where Sacramento held a 55-47 advantage.  The loss was the last game of Phoenix's season.

Sacramento will conclude its season in Los Angeles on Wednesday against the Clippers.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 120-111, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday night.

The Pacers (41-40) came in knowing they needed to simply keep winning in order to assure themselves of a playoff berth. However, they knew not to underestimate the Sixers (28-53), who'd given many teams a difficult time, particularly at home. Indiana's best players ensured that there was no letdown, with Paul George leading the way with 27 points, five assists, two rebounds, two steals and one block. The Pacers jumped out to a 35-20 lead in the first quarter and although Philadelphia made up ground the rest of the way, Indiana's 57.6 percent shooting and 44-33 rebounding advantage helped secure victory.

Thaddeus Young followed with 20 points, eight rebounds, three assists and one steal. Myles Turner contributed an 18-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist, four blocks and two steals. Jeff Teague supplied 15 points, six assists, two boards and two steals. Kevin Seraphin led the second unit with 17 points, six rebounds and one steal.

Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot paced the Sixers with 24 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Richaun Holmes followed with 17 points, six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Alex Poythress and Nik Stauskas followed with bench-leading 15-point efforts, with the former adding a rebound and a steal and the latter registering two assists. T.J. McConnell filled out the stat sheet with 12 points, eight assists, five rebounds and three steals. Dario Saric matched McConnell's scoring total and supplemented it with six rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block.

The Pacers close out the season at home on Wednesday versus the Atlanta Hawks, while the Sixers head to New York to do battle with the Knicks on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 114-105, at TD Garden on Monday evening. 

The Celtics (52-29) knew that they needed to win out their last two games in order to have a shot at the top seed in the Eastern Conference. With the news coming out earlier in the day that the Cavaliers had opted to rest both LeBron James and Kyrie Irving on Monday night versus the Heat, Boston had even a bit extra motivation to ensure they took care of business against the dangerous Nets (20-61). They came smoking out of the gates, building a 28-13 first-quarter lead and a 58-40 edge by halftime. Although the Nets made things interesting with a 55-point second half, the home team ultimately prevailed with balanced offense that included a pair of double-digit scoring efforts off the bench.

Jeremy Lin led the way for Brooklyn with a 26-point, 12-assist double-double that also included four assists and one block. Brook Lopez was right behind him with 25 points, seven rebounds, two assists and one block. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson managed a 17-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists, four steals and two blocks. Caris LeVert totaled 12 points, three rebounds, two assists and one block. Justin Hamilton led the second unit with 11 points, four rebounds, one steal and one block.

Isaiah Thomas spearheaded Boston with 27 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal. Al Horford pitched in with 19 points, eight boards, four assists, one steal and one block. Avery Bradley supplied 18 points, five rebounds and two assists. Jae Crowder filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, eight rebounds, six assists, two blocks and one steal. Marcus Smart led the bench with 13 points, six assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Kelly Olynyk was solid as a reserve as well with 11 points, six rebounds and three assists.

The Nets finish up the season on Wednesday night against the Bulls in Chicago, while the Celtics remain home to tangle with the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 89-79, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Monday evening. 

The Bucks (42-39) came in looking to put a couple of wins together before the postseason in order to have some momentum heading in to the second season. They drew a good matchup with which to accomplish that goal, as the Hornets (36-45) announced earlier in the day that Kemba Walker (knee) would sit out the remaining two games of the regular season. Without their superstar guard, Charlotte was considerably challenged to generate offense, and finished the night with just 40.7 percent shooting from the field and 27.8 percent from three-point range. Milwaukee countered with respective 45.5 and 57.1 percent success rates and also won the rebounding battle by a 45-39 margin.

Michael Kidd-Gilchrist served as the Hornets' leading scorer on the night with 13 points, which he complemented with five rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Treveon Graham and Jeremy Lamb followed with matching 12-point efforts off the bench. Graham only added two steals but Lamb also provided four rebounds, one assist and one steal. Nicolas Batum generated 11 points, eight assists, five rebounds, four steals and one block.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 124-121, in overtime at American Airlines Arena on Monday. 

These are two teams on different ends of the playoff spectrum, as they left it all on the floor in this overtime thriller. It took a big comeback for Miami to send this one into overtime, as they overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to send it to an extra session. Tyler Johnson was the hero, as he hit four-straight free-throws in the final minute of OT to take the lead and eventually win. There were nine ties and 15 lead changes in total in this overtime thriller. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the key for Miami, as they recorded nine more assists than Cleveland, while committing eight less turnovers. The Heat also dominated down low, outscoring the Cavaliers in the paint, 50-32.

The Cavaliers (51-30) had to play this game without LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, but their secondary players put in a monster effort. Deron Williams was spectacular in a fill-in role, accumulating 35 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. Kevin Love totaled 25 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out in overtime. Channing Frye started and amassed 21 points and seven rebounds. Kyle Korver was the only bench player with more than four points, as he dropped 18 points and eight boards. Cleveland's final game will be on Wednesday, when they host the Toronto Raptors. 

The Heat (40-41) needed to win this game keep to their playoff hopes alive and they pulled out this nail biter to live another day. Tyler Johnson led the way for Miami, as he provided 24 points, five rebounds and four assists off the bench. Hassan Whiteside was equally as good, accruing 21 points, 18 rebounds and two blocks. James Johnson collected 16 points and nine assists, while Josh Richardson totaled 19 points, six rebounds, four assists and five steals. Miami's final game will be on Wednesday against the Washington Wizards.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Orlando Magic, 122-75, at United Center on Monday. 

Chicago needed this game to keep their playoff hopes alive and they ended this one early in a dominating effort. In fact, the Bulls held at least an 18-point lead for the final three quarters, in addition to leading by at least 30 for the entire fourth quarter. All the statistics were lopsided, as Chicago shot 54 percent from the field, while holding Orlando to just 35 percent on their end. The Bulls also dominated the rebounding differential, winning that battle, 54-37. Orlando really struggled from long range too, hitting just 5-of-27 from three-point range, while Chicago went 12-of-26.

The Magic (28-53) had a tough task here against a motivated Bulls team and this ended up being one of their ugliest losses of the season. Nikola Vucevic was a bright spot for Orlando, as he tallied 14 points, 10 rebounds and two assists. Aaron Gordon finished with 10 points, six rebounds and two assists. Elfrid Payton accumulated 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Bismack Biyombo played well off the bench, totaling seven points, seven rebounds, two steals and two blocks. The Magic's next and final game is on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons. 

The Bulls (40-41) were tied for the eighth-seed in the east coming into this game, so to say this win was crucial would be a drastic understatement. Jerian Grant started for Rajon Rondo and accrued 17 points, 11 assists and two steals. Jimmy Butler matched those 17 points, adding five rebounds, three assists and three steals to his tally. Robin Lopez led the team, as he amassed 18 points and eight rebounds. Nikola Mirotic collected 16 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. The Bulls have a great matchup in their final game, as they host the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons 105-101 Monday at Palace in Auburn Hills. 

The Wizards (49-32) came into Monday's contest undermanned, as both John Wall (thigh) and Otto Porter (back) were ruled inactive, and head coach Scott Brooks said that his regular starters were going to play limited minutes. That was until Bradley Beal and Markieff Morris decided to carry the team anyway, as the two combined for over half of Washington's points in the victory. Beal was hitting from all over the floor and finished with a game-high 33 points on 13-of-20 shooting in 33 minutes. Meanwhile, in just 27 minutes, Morris managed to record 20 points on 9-of-16 shooting from the field and eight rebounds. The Wizards opened the game up early, leading by 13 points after the first quarter, and while the Pistons (37-44) managed to creep their way back in, Beal managed to make enough plays down the stretch to hold them off. 

Detroit's loss ended what was a two-game winning streak, but the team has still lost 11 of their last 15 games. They were led Monday night by Tobias Harris off the bench, who scored a team-high 22 points in 31 minutes as a reserve. He led the way for a bench mob that accounted for 55 of the team's 101 points. Ish Smith managed to put together yet another nice performance at point guard, scoring 16 points and dishing out nine assists, and while the Pistons managed to make more field goals and three-point shots than their counterparts, the difference ended up being at the free throw line, where Detroit managed to attempt just five shots compared to Washington hitting 14-of-16 from the stripe. 

Up next, in the final game of the season for both teams Wednesday, the Wizards will travel to Miami to take on the Heat, while the Pistons will finish up in Orlando against the Magic.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the San Antonio Spurs 99-98 Monday at Moda Center. 

After a game that was close and hard-fought throughout, the chances of the Trail Blazers (41-40) -- who rested Damian Lillard, C.J. McCollum and Allen Crabbe now that they've locked up the No. 8 seed --  winning was starting to look slim. With just seven seconds left and up by one, the visiting Spurs (61-20) had the ball and were a pair of made free throws away from going to overtime at worst. However, a Kyle Anderson turnover gave Portland one last chance. They took advantage, as a near turnover from Shabazz Napier turned into a wind open layup at the buzzer for Noah Vonleh. The Trail Blazers notched their third straight victory and their eighth straight at home. 

Portland was lead by a career-best night from Napier, who started at point guard in place of Lillard. Napier finished with a career-high 32 points 9-of-20 shooting from the field and 10-of-11 shooting from the free throw line. Each of the Trail Blazers' five starters managed to score in double figures, and those five ended up doing the heavy lifting for an undermanned team, as they combined scored 88 of the team's 99 points Monday night. In fact, the three players that came off the bench combined to shoot a horrid 4-of-27 (15 percent) from the field. 

As for the Spurs, they had all regular rotation players active and healthy, but head coach Gregg Popovich elected to limit the minutes of his key players. Most notably, Kawhi Leonard played just 20 minutes and was absent during the final stretch of the game. Yet, somehow, the MVP-candidate managed to score a game-high 18 points as he shot 8-of-11 from the field. No other San Antonio player managed to score more than 12 points, as majority of the bench struggled to get anything going despite most of them playing more minutes than usual. 

Up next, the Spurs, who have now lost three of their last five games, will travel to Utah for their season finale Wednesday, while the Trail Blazers will play their final game at home Wednesday against the Pelicans.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers blew out the Houston Rockets on Monday, 125-96.

LA (50-31) remains in a close battle with Utah to earn home-court advantage in their first round series.  Monday's game saw an easy win for the Clippers, as they held a double-digit lead for almost the entirety of the second half.  Seven Clippers players scored in double digits, as the game proved to be a well-rounded team victory.  Superstar point guard Chris Paul led the team with 19 points and dished out nine assists on the night.  The team finally appeared to be healthy and firing on all cylinders, as the Clippers ended with a 49-41 rebounding advantage and shot over 50 percent from the field on the night.  It was also a historic night for veteran forward Paul Pierce, who scored 10 points to pass John Havlicek for 15th on the all-time scoring list.  

Houston (54-27) had a rough night on Monday, starting with superstar James Harden.  The MVP contender shot just 2-of-9 from the field and 9-of-14 at the free-throw line while committing five fouls and five turnovers in only 24 minutes of play.  That was roughly how the night went for most of the Rockets' lineup, as the team finished shooting only 39 percent from the field.  Rebounding also played a role in the blowout, as Houston was at an eight-rebound disadvantage by the night's end.  

The Clippers will host the Kings on Wednesday, while Houston will host the Timberwolves.

												The visiting Utah Jazz took down the Golden State Warriors on Monday, 105-99.

Utah (50-31) reached a major milestone with its 50th win on Monday, its first 50-win season since 2010.  Thanks to the win, the Jazz became just the fifth team in NBA history to move from the 20s to the 30s to the 40s to the 50s in the win column in consecutive seasons.  Monday's upset win came thanks in large part to strong play from star center Rudy Gobert.  Gobert led the team with a whopping 18 rebounds and also posted 17 points.  Overall, the night proved to be a stellar one for Utah on the offensive end.  The team drained 13 three-pointers and saw six players score in double figures.

Golden State (66-15) has locked up the top spot in the Western Conference and thus has little to play for during its remaining games.  The Warriors did, however, lose a league-best 14-game win streak after falling to Utah on Monday.  Recently-returned superstar Kevin Durant posted a 16-point, 10-rebound double-double in just his second game back from a knee injury.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry, meanwhile, led the team in scoring with an impressive 28 points.  The team chose to sit All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson on Monday.  With the loss, the Warriors fell to 1-3 on the season without Thompson in the lineup.

In their final games of the season on Wednesday, the Jazz will host the Spurs, while the Warriors will host the Lakers.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the New York Knicks, 110-97, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon.

The Raptors (50-31) checked into Sunday's game with plenty of motivation for a win, considering that a victory would clinch them the third seed in the Eastern Conference. Standing in their way was a short-handed but feisty Knicks (30-51) squad that had shown some fight recently despite having been long eliminated from playoff contention. Through the first three quarters, New York gave Toronto all they could handle, entering the fourth quarter trailing only 76-75. However, the Raptors turned it on at that point, going on a 12-0 run midway through the period that helped seal the win. DeMar DeRozan once again led the way, turning in a remarkable 35-point effort on 11-of-15 shooting from the field, and complementing the scoring with a pair of rebounds. That led to a stellar 52.6 percent success rate from the field for the visitors on their way to their 22nd road win of the campaign.

Kyle Lowry was an ideal complement to DeRozan's fireworks, turning in an efficient 17-point, 11-assist double-double that also included seven rebounds, three steals and a block. Lowry was particularly effective from three-point range, draining four of nine attempts from behind the arc. Patrick Patterson turned in a bench-leading 15 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds, one assist and one steal. Serge Ibaka contributed 12 points and four rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas had a modest outing, posting six points, seven boards and one steal. Jakob Poeltl (eight points, seven rebounds) and P.J. Tucker (eight points, seven rebounds, one assist and one steal) were productive as reserves as well.

Willy Hernangomez led the way for New York with 24 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and three steals. Courtney Lee followed with 14 points, three assists and one steal. Mindauguas Kuzminskas led the bench with 12 points and one rebound. Ron Baker provided 11 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and one steal. Justin Holiday drew another start and compiled 10 points, five rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. 

The Raptors head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Wednesday evening to close out the season, while the Knicks are home against the Sixers in their season finale on Wednesday night as well.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 126-125, in overtime at Philips Arena on Sunday. 

In this potential playoff preview, Cleveland suffered an incredible collapse. In fact, they led by 26 headed into the fourth quarter, but allowed Atlanta to outscore them 44-18 in the final quarter to send it to overtime. Despite the Cavaliers leading for most of the overtime, Atlanta finished the game on a 15-9 run to comeback yet again and win. Scoring in the paint was the only real advantage for the Hawks, as they won that battle, 58-48. Their bench was huge as well, outscoring Cleveland's bench, 44-16.

The Cavaliers (52-28) simply fell apart in this game and it'll go down as their worst loss of the season. LeBron James picked up his 15th triple-double of the year though, collecting 32 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists before fouling out in overtime. Kyrie Irving led the team in scoring, accruing 45 points, two rebounds and nine assists. Kevin Love finished with 11 points, 15 rebounds and five assists. Channing Frye started and totaled 12 points and eight rebounds. On deck for the Cavaliers is a road matchup versus the Miami Heat on Monday.

The Hawks (41-39) had one of their greatest comebacks in franchise history here, as they've now handed the Cavaliers back-to-back devastating losses. Paul Millsap returned to his starting role to provide 22 points, nine rebounds and two assists. Dwight Howard amassed 19 points, five rebounds and two assists on 9-of-12 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. accumulated 21 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Kent Bazemore was a nice spark off the bench, contributing 13 points, two rebounds, four assists and four steals. Mike Muscala also played well off the bench, dropping 12 points, five rebounds and four assists. Atlanta will look to keep rolling on Tuesday against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Denver Nuggets, 106-105, at Pepsi Center on Sunday. 

All the talk in this game will be around Russell Westbrook and rightfully so. Not only did he set the record for triple-doubles in a season in this win, he hit the game-winner at the buzzer from nearly 40-feet out. It took a huge comeback to pull out the victory too, as they outscored Denver, 25-14, in the fourth quarter. Rebounding was the difference for Oklahoma City, as they won that battle, 54-42.  

The Thunder (46-34) are locked into the six-seed in the west, but this will be a game Oklahoma City fans remember forever. Westbrook picked up his 42nd triple-double of the season, which passed the all-time record set by Oscar Robertson. He finished with 50 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists. He actually scored the final 18 points for Oklahoma City and hit the game-winning three from just inside halfcourt. Steven Adams was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 10 points and 10 rebounds. Enes Kanter was a nice spark off the bench, providing 15 points and eight rebounds. Oklahoma City's next game is on Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves. 

The Nuggets (38-42) needed this win to keep their season alive and they prevailed despite Westbrook's record-setting day. Danilo Gallinari did all he could for Denver, as he tallied 34 points, 10 rebounds and three assists. Nikola Jokic finished with 23 points, six rebounds and three assists. Wilson Chandler amassed 17 points and 10 rebounds. Emmanuel Mudiay played well off the bench, dropping 14 points, five rebounds and three assists. That marks the end of Denver's playoff pursuit, as they'll play the Dallas Mavericks for their next game on Tuesday.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 124-111, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday. 

These are two teams battling for lottery positioning and this win for Phoenix may not be what management wanted. In any case, the Suns really dominated in the first and third quarters, outscoring the Mavericks, 76-49. Shooting was the difference in the game, with Phoenix shooting 55 percent from the field, 42 percent from three-point range and 88 percent from the free-throw line. Dallas shot just 42 percent from the field, 36 percent from three-point range and 68 percent from the free-throw line. The Suns also dominated down low, outscoring the Mavericks in the paint, 56-34.

The Mavericks (32-48) played this game without Harrison Barnes and Seth Curry, as they simply didn't have enough in the arsenal to compete with the Suns. Yogi Ferrell led the way for Dallas, as he accrued 21 points, four rebounds and four assists. Dwight Powell had a nice game off the bench, providing 21 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Dorian Finney-Smith finished with six points, 11 rebounds and three assists. 

The Suns (24-57) had lost 13 of 14 headed into this game, so a win is a good confidence booster going forward. Tyler Ulis was the player of the game, as he collected 20 points, three rebounds and 10 assists. Devin Booker totaled 21 points, two rebounds and three assists. Alex Len recorded a double-double, amassing 14 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks. T.J, Warren totaled 21 points and seven rebounds, going a perfect 8-of-8 from the field. Dragan Bender had one of the best games of his rookie season, producing nine points, eight rebounds and three assists off the bench.

												The visiting Houston Rockets took down the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, 135-128.

Houston (54-26) saw another win in what is turning out to be a very successful season.  Superstar guard James Harden led the team on Sunday, recording his 12th triple-double of the season including 35 points.  However, he also struggled with ball control, committing 10 turnovers on the night.  The Rockets continued their stellar three-point shooting, knocking down 18 three-pointers on the night and shooting almost 57 percent from the field.  They also shot a respectable 27-of-31 from the free-throw line.

Sacramento (31-49) is surprisingly having a bit of a late-season renaissance, as the team is now 5-6 in its last 11 games.  The team put forward a balanced effort on Sunday, as they saw seven players score in double figures.  Two Kings tied for a team high with 20 points.  Veteran point guard Ty Lawson was one of the two, scoring 20 and dishing out 11 assists.  Rookie Skal Labissiere, meanwhile, scored 20 points on a stellar 8-of-10 from the field.  As a whole, the Kings shot almost 50 percent from the field, but hit only eight three-pointers on the night.  

The Rockets will visit the Clippers on Monday, while Sacramento will host the Suns on Tuesday.

												The visiting Detroit Pistons took down the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday, 103-90.

Detroit (37-43) came off a tough stretch of games, having dropped seven of their last 10 going into the Sunday's matchup.  The Pistons looked top-notch on Sunday, though, as they poured in 14 three-pointers on the night.  Detroit also excelled on the glass, holding a 46-30 advantage in the rebounding column.  The leading rebounder was All-Star center Andre Drummond, who pulled down 11 boards.  Six Pistons finished the game with double-figure scoring, and the team ended up shooting over 47 percent from the field as a whole.

Memphis (43-38) is locked into the seventh seed and will play San Antonio in the first round of the playoffs.  As such, Sunday's off night was not too much of a cause for concern.  The Grizzlies enjoyed plenty of rest, as no player played more than 27 minutes.  Point guard Mike Conley helped the team stay in the game, scoring 15 points in 23 minutes of play.  Despite the low play time for their starters, the team's ""grit-and-grind"" style continued, as they came away with an impressive 12 steals on the night.  

Detroit will host the Wizards on Monday, while Memphis will host the Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 110-109 at Staples Center on Sunday. 

The Lakes (24-55) held on for victory over the Timberwolves (31-48) despite Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins combined 81 points. The Minnesota duo both were shooting lights out and keeping their team in the game, one in which they opted to only run four players deep on the bench. Towns and Wiggins played 41 minutes and 38 minutes, respectively, which were the two highest totals for either team. The Lakers jumped out to an eight point lead at the end of the first quarter, but the efficient shooting and non-existent answer to stopping Towns on the block and in the paint made for a dramatic finish. With :32 remaining the in the fourth quarter, Julius Randle dunked home two points that brought the Lakers within two points of the leading Timberwolves, while Randle also rebounded the Metta-Wolrd Peace missed three and kicked it to D'Angelo Russell, who drained the game winning three-pointer with :02 left. 

Towns finished with 40 points, 21 rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block on 17-of-22 shooting. Wiggins totaled 41 points on 13-of-26 shooting, including 2-of-5 from behind the arc. 

D'Angelo Russell was not nearly as efficient as his opponents, but did finish with 16 points, four assists and four rebounds, while Randle added 13 points, eight boards, two assists, one steal and one block in his 28 minutes of work. 

Both teams play on Tuesday, as the Timberwolves host the Oklahoma City Thunder, while the Lakers host the New Orleans Pelicans.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Chicago Bulls, 107-106, at Barclays Center on Saturday afternoon.

Someone apparently forgot to tell the Nets (20-60) that they have nothing left to play for, as they've been particularly impressive in the second half of the season. One of their recent trademarks has been giving quality teams a very difficult time, even those with plenty of motivation for playoff positioning. The Bulls (39-41) were the latest team to learn that lesson the hard way, as they fell victim to a Brooklyn fourth-quarter comeback and dropped a one-point decision that could jeopardize their playoff hopes. Spencer Dinwiddie's two free throws with 13 seconds remaining snapped a 103-103 tie, and Jimmy Butler's three-pointer with one second left came too little too late for Chicago. While the Bulls shot better than the Nets and also won the rebounding battle by a 52-44 margin, they also committed 17 turnovers, contributing to their demise.

Butler led the way for the visitors with 33 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Robin Lopez tallied 16 points, eight rebounds and one block. Jerian Grant followed with 15 points, five assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block. Dwyane Wade made his return from an elbow injury that was once thought to be season-ending and posted 14 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a block over 25 minutes. Nikola Mirotic rounded out the starting five's night with four points, seven rebounds, two steals and two blocks.

Caris LeVert and Dinwiddie  led the way for Brooklyn with matching 19-point efforts.  LeVert added five rebounds, one assist and one steal while Dinwiddie supplied four assists, three rebounds and two steals. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson generated a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included three assists, three steals and one block.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 121-114, at Spectrum Center on Saturday afternoon.

The Celtics (51-29) checked into Saturday looking to quickly right the ship after losing their previous two games and falling out of the top spot in the Eastern Conference in the process. While they retained a modest chance of still overtaking the Cavaliers, their overriding purpose in notching a win Saturday was to avoid falling further back in the standings, given that the Toronto Raptors were only 1.5 games behind. Boston was able to accomplish that goal by getting off to a fast start and building a 71-54 halftime lead. However, the Hornets (36-44) mounted a furious comeback in the third and eventually took a seven-point lead in the fourth before the Celtics clawed back to tally their 22nd road win of the season.

Isaiah Thomas led the way for the Celtics with 32 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Al Horford followed with 16 points, seven assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. Jae Crowder posted a near double-double of 15 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Avery Bradley matched Crowder's scoring total and added six rebounds, four assists and a block. Kelly Olynyk drew the start for Amir Johnson (illness) and registered a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included four assists and one block. Jaylen Brown led the second unit with 10 points and three boards.

Nicolas Batum paced Charlotte with 31 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds and three assists. Kemba Walker totaled 23 points, eight assists, one rebound and one steal. Jeremy Lamb was next with a bench-leading 17 points, along with five rebounds, one assist and two blocks. Cody Zeller offered 12 points, nine rebounds, two assists and three steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist managed eight points, four rebounds, one assist and one block.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the host Orlando Magic, 127-112, at Amway Center on Saturday evening. 

This marks the third win in a row for the Pacers, who are back in business, after losing four straight. They need everything they can get in order to stay in possession of a playoff spot in the East. They came into this game only one game ahead of the ninth-place Heat, and made sure it will stay that way for now, by winning all four quarters, behind 37 from Paul George. 

The Pacers shot a blistering 59.3 percent from the field and 50 percent from long distance. George led the way with 37 points on 14-of-22 shooting, including 4-of-9 from long range, along with seven rebounds and six assists, in 40 minutes. Myles Turner followed up with 23 points on 10-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds and two blocks, in 30 minutes. Three other players scored in double digits for the Pacers, including C.J. Miles and Kevin Seraphin, who chipped in 11 each off the bench, while Thaddeus Young added 14 points on 7-of-8 shooting, in 31 minutes. The Pacers head to Philly, where they will take on the 76ers on Monday. 

Meanwhile, Terrence Ross led the Magic, with 29 points on 10-of-17 shooting, including 6-of-11 from downtown. Evan Fournier followed up with 23 points, while Elfrid Payton added 10 points and 10 assists. Aaron Gordon went for 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting, in 37 minutes. The Magic gave up a troublesome 64 points in the paint. They go on to face the Bulls in Chicago on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 90-82, at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday night.

The Bucks (41-39) needed to make sure they took care of their business against the Sixers (28-52), as they checked into Saturday not yet having clinched a playoff spot. Milwaukee got off on the right foot in that regard with a 23-21 first-quarter advantage, but Philadelphia bounced back by taking the second quarter by a 27-19 margin. However, the Bucks gained some distance with an outstanding third quarter in which they held their hosts to 12 points. They turned in a stellar defensive effort overall, limiting the Sixers to success rates of 35.1 percent from the field and 25.8 percent from three-point range.

Giannis Antetokounmpo supplied a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included six assists, three steals and two blocks. Greg Monroe followed with a bench-leading 17 points that he supplemented with five boards, three assists, two steals and one block. Matthew Dellavedova was next with 14 points, three rebounds and three assists. Khris Middleton filled out the stat sheet with eight points, eight rebounds, two assists and three steals. Spencer Hawes was productive as a reserve as well with eight points and two rebounds.

Richaun Holmes led the way for the Sixers with 17 points, 10 rebounds and one block. Dario Saric filled out the stat sheet with 14 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two steals. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot managed 12 points, four rebounds, two assists and four steals. T.J. McConnell posted a 10-point, 10-assist double-double that also included two rebounds and three steals. Justin Anderson rounded out a strong night for the starting five with eight points, six boards and two assists.

The Bucks head back home to take on the Charlotte Hornets on Monday evening, while the Sixers remain home to tangle with the Indiana Pacers on Monday night.

												The Miami Heat kept their playoff hopes alive with a huge, 106-103, win in Washington, at Verizon Center, on Saturday evening. 

This marked the second game of a back-to-back for the Heat, who left it all on the court and came through with a win to keep their playoff hopes alive. They led by four entering the fourth quarter, where both teams battled, trading the lead multiple times down the stretch. The Heat were down by one when they took a full timeout with 20 seconds left. They set up an isolation play for James Johnson, which worked to perfection as he cruised his way to the rack for an easy layup and the one-point advantage. The Wizards then had a chance to win it with the final possession, however Kelly Oubre Jr. made a poor inbound pass that the Heat easily picked off. Josh Richardson was then fouled and sank two shots at the line, sealing the three-point win. 

Hassan Whiteside came up big, leading the Heat with 30 points on 12-of-19 shooting, along with 12 rebounds, three blocks, two assists and two steals, in 37 minutes. Tyler Johnson followed up with 19 points, while Goran Dragic chipped in 18 points and seven assists. James Johnson came up huge down the stretch, finishing with 15 points, 11 rebounds and five assists, in 37 minutes. The Heat are now tied with the Bulls for eighth place, and one game behind the seventh-place Pacers. They will need to take care of business on Monday, when they play host to the Cavaliers, in order to keep the dream alive. 

Meanwhile, all five starters scored in double digits for Washington, led by Markieff Morris, who finished with 21 points on 9-of-13 shooting.  John Wall and Bradley Beal added 16 points each, while Marcin Gortat double-doubled with 11 points and 11 rebounds. The Wizards head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Monday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host San Antonio Spurs, 98-87, at AT&T Center on Saturday. 

These are two teams that have secured playoff berths, but they still fought hard in this potential playoff preview. In fact, there were four ties and 10 lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 14. Los Angeles were in control for most of the game though, leading for over 40 minutes and holding a lead for the entirety of the second half. Shooting was the difference in the game, with the Clippers hitting 50 percent of their shots and the Spurs shooting just 43 percent from the field. Los Angeles also dominated down low, winning the point in the paint differential, 48-32. 

The Clippers (49-31) have now won five-straight games, as they have some serious momentum headed into the postseason. Chris Paul led the way, as he tallied 19 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. DeAndre Jordan totaled 17 points and 17 rebounds. Blake Griffin amassed 18 points and eight rebounds. Jamal Crawford was a nice spark off the bench, dropping 12 points.

The Spurs (61-19) are locked up in the two-seed in the west, but they still lost this game with all their weapons fully healthy. Kawhi Leonard was a bright spot for San Antonio, as he collected 28 points, five rebounds and five assists. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 18 points in 35 minutes. Pau Gasol was the only other Spur in double figures, as he provided 15 points and seven rebounds off the bench.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Utah Jazz, 101-86, at Moda Center on Saturday.

These are two teams that look poised to reach the postseason, as Portland showed how dangerous they can be. It was a near wire-to-wire win for the Blazers, with Utah maintaining just one lead in the opening two minutes. The first and third quarters is where Portland did their damage, outscoring Utah, 63-38, in those two quarters. Turnovers were the difference in the game, as Portland committed just three of them, while forcing the Jazz to commit 14 on their end. The Blazers also took advantage of the long ball, hitting 13-of-30 from three-point range, while the Jazz went just 6-of-19.

The Jazz (49-31) are now tied with the Los Angeles Clippers for the fourth-seed in the west, as this loss could be devastating for homecourt advantage. Gordon Hayward did all he could for Utah, as he led the way with 21 points, five rebounds and four assists. Rudy Gobert finished with 13 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks The other three starters combined for just eight points. Joe Johnson and Rodney Hood both scored in double figures off the bench. On deck for Utah is a road matchup versus the Golden State Warriors on Monday.

The Trail Blazers (40-40) are now 1.5 games up on the Denver Nuggets for the eighth-seed in the west, as this win got them one step closer to securing a playoff berth. Damian Lillard was the player of the game, as he scored 26 of his career-high 59 points in the first quarter. Lillard did that damage on 18-of-34 shooting, while also adding six rebounds and five assists to his tally. C.J. McCollum struggled, as he accrued nine points, three rebounds and five assists on 4-of-20 from the field.  Maurice Harkless was the only other Blazer in double figures, as he amassed 12 points, three rebounds and three steals. Portland will look to secure that playoff berth on Monday, when they host the San Antonio Spurs for their next game.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 123-101, at Oracle Arena on Saturday.

This was a lopsided matchup on paper and that proved to be true on the court as well. The second half was particularly lopsided, with Golden State leading by at least 20 points for the final 16 minutes. Rebounding was the biggest factor for the Warriors, as they won that battle, 53-34. They were also very efficient, recording 36 assists on 51 percent shooting, while committing just nine turnovers. Free-throw shooting was a factor as well, with Golden State hitting 15-of-16 and New Orleans going just 12-of-19. 

The Pelicans (33-47) played this game without Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, as they had very little to compete with the best team in the league. Alexis Ajinca got the start at center and led the starters with 17 points and six rebounds. Jrue Holiday accrued 10 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. Jordan Crawford and Quinn Cook played well off the bench, combining for 43 points on 18-of-29 from the field. On deck for New Orleans is a road matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. 

The Warriors (66-14) have secured the top-spot in the west and wins like this show just how motivated they are. Kevin Durant made his return from a knee injury to accrue 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Klay Thompson led the team, as he scored 20 points to add to his three rebounds and two assists. Ian Clark and Andre Iguodala were huge off the bench, as Clark provided 17 points, four rebounds and three assists, with Iguodala tallying 15 points, five rebounds and five assists. The Warriors will host the Utah Jazz for their next game on Monday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 114-100, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday. 

Cleveland were expected to win this game easily against a B-team Hawks unit, but Atlanta had other ideas. The game was close throughout the first three quarters, as there were seven ties and 14 lead changes in total. A 21-2 run in the fourth quarter really opened things up for the Hawks, as it gave them a game-high 20-point lead with four minutes remaining. The bench was the difference in the game, with Atlanta's bench outscoring the Cavaliers bench, 55-21. The assists were a decisive statistic too, with Atlanta recording 39 assists to Cleveland's 23. Three-point shooting really let the Cavaliers down, as they went 9-of-36 from downtown, while the Hawks went 16-of-37. 

The Hawks (41-38) played this game without Paul Millsap, Dennis Schroder, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard, but their role players fought hard in this amazing effort. Tim Hardaway Jr. led Atlanta with 22 points, two rebounds and five assists on 9-of-14 shooting. Kris Humphries started and accumulated 12 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Mike Dunleavy was huge off the bench, as he dropped 20 points in just 17 minutes. 

The Cavaliers (51-28) had one of their ugliest performances of the season, as they were outplayed at home by a beleaguered Hawks team. LeBron James led the way for Cleveland, as he collected 28 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Kevin Love totaled 15 points, 15 rebounds and three assists. Kyrie Irving amassed 18 points and seven assists. Channing Frye got the start and accrued 16 points, five rebounds and two blocks. 

These two teams will have a rematch on Sunday in Atlanta.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Miami Heat, 96-94, at Air Canada Centre on Friday night.

The Raptors (49-31) came in with a playoff berth assured but also seeking to stay locked into the third seed in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, the Heat's (38-41) postseason aspirations were in a much more precarious position, as they came into the night hanging on to the seventh seed by a thread. As it turned out, the team with a bit less to lose played with more urgency, as Toronto jumped out to a 26-19 first-quarter lead. Miami did battle back throughout the second and third quarters, setting up a pivotal final 12 minutes. However, the Raptors did just enough to keep the Heat at bay, taking a 94-88 lead with 25 seconds left after a DeMar DeRozan basket. Wayne Ellington gave the visitors hope with a three-pointer, but a pair of DeRozan three-pointers with four seconds remaining gave the home squad a commanding 96-91 advantage.

James Johnson led the way against his former teammates with 22 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocks. Goran Dragic followed with 18 points, one rebound, one assist and one steal. Hassan Whiteside posted a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists. Ellington matched Whiteside's scoring total off the bench and added one rebound, one assist and one steal. Josh Richardson totaled 10 points, four assists, two rebounds, three steals and one block. Rodney McGruder filled out the stat sheet with nine points, five rebounds and two assists. 

DeRozan paced Toronto with a game-high 38 points, which he supplemented with six boards, two assists, one steal and one block. Cory Joseph followed as a distant second with a bench-leading 14 points, along with four boards, three assists and three steals. Kyle Lowry filled out the stat sheet with 12 points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. Serge Ibaka had a near double-double with 11 points, nine rebounds and one block. Jonas Valanciunas mustered a modest nine points but hauled in 10 boards. 

The Heat next head to the Nation's Capital to do battle with the Washington Wizards on Saturday evening, while the Raptors head to New York to tangle with the Knicks on Sunday afternoon.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the New York Knicks, 101-88, at FedEx Forum on Friday night. 

The Grizzlies (43-37) came into Friday's game knowing they were facing a short-handed and likely unmotivated Knicks (30-50) squad, but needing to focus on getting their own house in order prior to the playoffs. Memphis had lost seven of the previous nine games and therefore needed a victory under any circumstance, and accordingly, they were able to take care of business Friday. New York announced that they'd be without Carmelo Anthony for rest purposes, and were already missing Kristaps Porzingis (back) and Derrick Rose (knee). However, their makeshift starting five did put up a valiant effort through three quarters before the home team pulled away with a 31-point fourth period. The Grizzlies enjoyed a rare strong shooting night, tallying a 50.7 percent success rate from the field and 55.6 percent figure from three-point range.

New York was led by Courtney Lee's 16 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds, three assists and one steal. Maurice Ndour followed with 15 points, seven rebounds, three blocks and one steal. Justin Holiday drew the start and put up 12 points, two rebounds, two assists and three steals. Willy Hernangomez provided an 11-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists and two steals. Mindaugas Kuzminskas led the second unit with 10 points and one rebound.

Mike Conley paced Memphis with a game-high 31 points, which he complemented with six assists, three rebounds and one steal. Marc Gasol tallied a 16-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists and three blocks. Wayne Selden was next with a bench-leading 13 points, two rebounds and two assists. Vince Carter filled out the stat sheet with 12 points, four rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Tony Allen and JaMychal Green managed matching 10-point efforts, with the former adding four rebounds and the latter hauling in five boards and adding one assist and one block. 

The Knicks head back home to await the Toronto Raptors on Sunday afternoon, while the Grizzlies remain home to face the Detroit Pistons on Sunday evening.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the host Houston Rockets, 114-109, at Toyota Center on Friday. 

This game was much more important for the Pistons than the Rockets and that was evident by this final scoreline. It took a big comeback for Detroit to win, as they outscored Houston, 39-22, in the fourth quarter. Offensive rebounding was a huge factor for the Pistons, as they won that battle, 18-9. Detroit also dominated down low, as they outscored Houston in the paint, 52-38. Efficiency was also key, with the Pistons recording 27 assists while committing just six turnovers. 

The Pistons (36-43) playoff hopes were hanging on a thread coming into this game and this win will keep it alive for the time being. Boban Marjanovic was the player of the game, as he provided 27 points and 12 rebounds on 12-of-18 shooting off Detroit's bench. Ish Smith tallied 20 points, three rebounds and five assists. Henry Ellenson got a rare start and totaled 15 points and 11 rebounds. Tobias Harris accrued 17 points, six rebounds and two assists off the bench. On deck for Detroit is a road matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday. 

The Rockets (53-26) have the three-seed locked up in the west and losses like this really don't matter at this point of the season. James Harden did all he could though, as he led Houston with 33 points, nine rebounds and 12 assists. No other starter reached double figures in scoring. Patrick Beverley did play well though, collecting six points, 13 rebounds and five assists. Lou Williams and Eric Gordon led the bench, as they scored 15 points a piece. Houston's next game will be on Sunday, when they play the Sacramento Kings on the road.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the host Dallas Mavericks, 102-89, at American Airlines Center, on Friday evening. 

The Mavs (32-47) started out strong and led, 61-50 at halftime. Despite resting six of their top players, the Spurs (61-18) came out on a mission in the third quarter, where they out-scored the Mavs 25-8, and finished the quarter on a 17-2 run. The Spurs took care of business in the fourth to complete the comeback win. 

LaMarcus Aldridge (rest), Kawhi Leonard (rest), Pau Gasol (rest), Tony Parker (rest), Manu Ginobili (rest) and Danny Green (thigh) were all sidelined, leaving the job up to the Spurs' youngsters and role players.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans, 122-106, at Pepsi Center on Friday evening. 

Denver led 30-25 after the first quarter, but went into half time up by only one, with the score 51-50. However, the Nuggets came out on a mission in the third quarter, where they poured in 41 points, to amass an 18-point lead heading into the fourth, and cruise to a significant victory in terms of their playoff chase. The Pelicans (33-46) kept Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday to only 24 minutes each, while DeMarcus Cousins sat out due to a sore achilles, giving the Nuggets (38-41) an extra edge.

Three players topped 20 points for Denver, including Jamal Murray, who led the way with a career-high 30 points on 10-of-14 shooting, in 38 minutes. Nikola Jokic followed up with 23 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and two steals, in 29 minutes, while Gary Harris added 20 points, nine assists, five rebounds and one steal. The Nuggets are now only one game behind the eighth-place Trail Blazers, and will look to inch closer, as they play host to the Thunder on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, Anthony Davis led the Pelicans with 25 points, in 24 minutes. Jordan Crawford poured in 20 points on 10-of-16 shooting, in 30 minutes off the bench, while Alexis Ajinca also came up big off the bench, with 15 points and seven rebounds, in 28 minutes. The only other player to score in double digits for New Orleans was E'Twaun Moore, who chipped in 10 points. The Pelicans face the second game of a back-to-back, as they play in Golden State on Saturday evening.

												The Utah Jazz hung on to defeat the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 120-113, at Vivint Smart Home Arena, on Friday evening. 

The Timberwolves led by 10 points with 6:50 left in the third quarter, but fell into their bad habit of falling apart late in games. The Jazz dropped 40 points in the third quarter and matched the T-Wolves point-for-point in the fourth, in order to complete the comeback. This marks the Timberwolves' 22nd loss of the season after having led by double digits in the game. This was a big win for the Jazz, who now pull another 0.5 games ahead of the Clippers, building their cushion to one game. 

Gordon Hayward poured in a career-high 39 points on 14-of-22 shooting, in 39 minutes of action, to lead the way for the Jazz.

The Jazz will be right back in action, as they take on the Trail Blazers in Portland on Saturday evening. 

Meanwhile, Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves with 32 points on 12-of-21 shooting, along with 13 rebounds, in 32 minutes.

												The host Phoenix Suns stunned the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday, winning, 120-99.

The Suns (23-57) did themselves no favors in terms of their lottery odds, as the win moved them back into a tie for second-worst record with the Los Angeles Lakers.  The resounding win did produce plenty of positives for the struggling team, though, as they saw 37 points from burgeoning star Devin Booker.  As a whole, Phoenix played a stellar game on the offensive end, shooting almost 52 percent from the field.  The Suns reached the free-throw line 31 times on the night, making 26 of their attempts.

OKC (45-34) saw a shocker, as the team had been rolling heading into Friday's game.  Superstar point guard Russell Westbrook was seen immediately heading to a practice court to put up shots after the loss, and given his performance, it may be hard to blame him.  The potential MVP had one of his worst outings of the season, shooting a dismal 6-of-25 from the field and turning the ball over eight times.  Though Westbrook finally officially secured a triple-double average for the season in the game, he failed to record a record-setting 42nd triple-double.  His poor shooting was also a large piece of OKC's offensive struggles on the night, as the team shot just 36 percent from the field.

OKC will visit Denver on Sunday, while Phoenix will host Dallas.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers took down the Sacramento Kings on Friday, 98-94.

Los Angeles (24-55) will lose its draft pick to Philadelphia if it does not land in the top three.  However, the team is currently in the midst of an ill-timed three-game winning streak, its longest since November.   It was a relatively modest night for the Lakers on both ends on Friday. as the win was far from a dominant one.  However, four of the starting five managed to score in double figures, a positive sign for the young LA core.  Third-year forward Julius Randle had a team-high 25 points to go along with six rebounds.  The team as a whole shot 44 percent and forced 23 turnovers.  

The Kings (31-48) narrowly missed the win thanks to sloppy play on the offensive end.  Though the team shot over 50 percent and made eight three-pointers while holding LA to just four, turnovers ended up hurting Sacramento's chances.  The team's solid offensive effort included 27 team assists, but was offset by a whopping 23 turnovers on the night.  Rookie big man Skal Labissiere led the team on the offensive end, scoring a team-high 19 points along with two blocked shots on defense.  

On Sunday, Sacramento will host the Rockets while LA will host the Timberwolves.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 102-90, at Wells Fargo Center on Thursday evening.

The Bulls (39-40) checked into Thursday night sitting in the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference and armed with the good news that Dwyane Wade (elbow) would be returning to the lineup on Saturday night. However, they had to make sure and take care of business on the road against a Sixers (28-51) squad that had given many a team a difficult time. Chicago got off on the right foot with a 27-17 first-quarter lead and remained consistent throughout, while also playing stellar defense. The Bulls limited Philadelphia to success rates of 36.3 percent from the field and 21.2 percent from behind the arc, and they also won the rebounding battle by a 57-50 margin.

Nikola Mirotic led the way for the visitors with 22 points, eight rebounds, two assists and one block. Jimmy Butler followed with a 19-point, 10-rebound, 10-assist triple-double that also included a pair of steals. Jerian Grant contributed 15 points, eight boards, five assists and a pair of steals. Joffrey Lauvergne paced the second unit with 14 points, two rebounds, one assist and one steal. Bobby Portis was productive as a reserve as well with a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double in 21 minutes.

Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot paced the Sixers with 18 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Justin Anderson managed 17 points, four rebounds and one steal. Nik Stauskas followed with a bench-leading 13 points, four assists, three rebounds and one steal. Richaun Holmes supplied a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two steals and one block. Dario Saric mustered nine points, 10 boards, one assist, one steal and one block. T.J. McConnell filled out the stat sheet in typical fashion, producing nine points, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals. 

The Bulls next head to Brooklyn to tangle with the Nets on Saturday evening, while the Sixers remain home to tangle with the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night as well.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 115-107, at Amway Center on Thursday evening.

Both teams checked into Thursday's game having long been eliminated from playoff contention despite having the ability to put together some high scoring tallies on occasion. The Nets (19-60) had demonstrated as much on multiple occasions during their recent 6-4 stretch, while the Magic (28-51) had weapons in Elfrid Payton and Nikola Vucevic that matched up very well against Brooklyn's biggest weaknesses. All of those factors came into play Thursday, as both teams hit the 46-percent mark from the field and engaged in an entertaining see-saw battle. True to their recent level of play, the Nets wouldn't go away easily, mounting a fourth-quarter comeback that ultimately fell short. 

Jeremy Lin enjoyed a standout night, leading the way for the visitors with 32 points and supplementing them with five rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. Caris LeVert followed with 20 points, which he supplemented with four boards and one assist. Brook Lopez had a quiet night, generating a modest 10 points, five rebounds and two assists over 31 minutes. Spencer Dinwiddie led the bench with 11 points, three rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. Isaiah Whitehead and Justin Hamilton produced a pair of 10-point efforts off the bench as well. 

Elfrid Payton paced the Magic with a 22-point, 11-assist double-double that also included five rebounds, one steal and one block. Aaron Gordon registered 21 points, six rebounds, two assists and three steals. Jodie Meeks was next with 20 points and two rebounds. Nikola Vucevic tallied an 18-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included five assists and one steal. Mario Hezonja led the bench with 11 points, four rebounds, one assist and two blocks. 

The Nets head back home to tangle with the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night while the Magic remain home and await the Indiana Pacers for a Saturday evening showdown as well.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 104-89 Thursday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 

In Thursday's contest, the Pacers (39-40) never found themselves dominating at any one point. Rather, it was a steadily dominant 48 minutes for them, led by their superstar Paul George. George finished with a team-high 23 points on an efficient 9-of-14 shooting from the field to go along with 10 rebounds in 35 minutes. As a team, the Pacers saw six different players score in double figures in what was a wire-to-wire victory for Indiana. It wasn't the greatest shooting night, as the team shot 47.5 percent from the field and 32 percent from three, but it was enough to get it done thanks in large part to their stout defensive effort. 

The Bucks (40-39) didn't shoot horribly in the contest, as they actually hit 11 of their 24 (45.8 percent) three-point attempts. Rather, it was Indiana's ability to force turnovers that ultimately cost them the game, with Milwaukee choking the ball up 21 times, which was the same number of assists they had. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had a great all-around game with 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists in 35 minutes, but only only two of his teammates managed to score in double figures as well, with Mirza Teletovic posting 15 points off the bench and Khris Middleton adding 10. The loss is the Bucks' third straight after they rattled off six wins in seven games. 

Up next, the Bucks will travel to Philadelphia on Saturday to take on the 76ers, while the Pacers will look to make it three straight wins when they head to Orlando on Saturday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the New York Knicks 106-103 Thursday at Madison Square Garden. 

Things looked to be going smoothly for the Wizards (48-31), as they managed to hold a comfortable lead throughout the first three quarters of Thursday's contest. However, a short Knicks' spurt in the final period ultimately tied the game at 97. In the end, some timely free throws and a final go-ahead three-pointer from Bradley Beal -- along with a missed three-pointer from Carmelo Anthony at the buzzer -- ultimately helped the Washington hold off the Knicks (30-49). Beal led the way for the Wizards, scoring a game-high 25 points in 36 minutes with John Wall not too far behind him, as the All-Star point guard notched 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting and eight assists in just 32 minutes. As a team, the Wizards were hot from behind the arc, hitting 14 of their 34 shots from long range (41.2 percent), and they ended up needing every last one of them. 

As for the Knicks, despite their season being all but over, they still managed to put together an inspiring performance in front of their home crowd. Anthony led the way with a team-high 23 points but on a fairly inefficient 7-of-19 shooting from the field. In the end, it was an all-around solid performance from New York, as six players in all managed to score in double figures, but they were just unable to hit all the shots they needed to hit during crunch time. Despite the loss, the Knicks are still team games ahead of both the Magic and 76ers for the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference. 

Up next, the Wizards will head home Saturday to take on the Heat, while the Knicks will head to Memphis on Friday to play the Grizzlies.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Boston Celtics, 123-116, at Philips Arena on Thursday. 

These are two teams battling for playoff positioning and it was evident by the final scoreline. Despite Atlanta leading by 20 at times in the third quarter, Boston fought back and made it a close game. Rebounding was key for the Hawks, as they outrebounded the Celtics, 52-38. Atlanta also shot well, hitting 49 percent of their shots, while holding Boston to just 41 percent from the field. 

The Celtics (50-29) have now lost two-straight games, as the top-spot in the east is slowly slipping away. Isaiah Thomas did all he could for Boston, as he accumulated 35 points, five rebounds and four assists. Jae Crowder totaled 24 points and four rebounds. Avery Bradley amassed 17 points, four rebounds and two steals. Marcus Smart was huge off the bench, providing 18 points, four rebounds, seven assists, six steals and two blocks. On deck for the Celtics is a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday. 

The Hawks (40-38) needed this win after losing nine of their last 11 games and they came out hot to keep a hold on to the five-seed in the east. Paul Millsap was the player of the game, as he contributed 26 points, 12 rebounds, four assists and two steals off the bench. Tim Hardaway Jr finished with 23 points, five rebounds and five assists. Taurean Prince tallied 20 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Dennis Schroder collected 18 points, four rebounds and five assists. The next matchup for Atlanta is tough, as they have a road game versus the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers took down the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday, 105-98.

Portland (39-40) is pushing for the playoffs and has recently taken control of the eight seed in the Western Conference.  Interestingly, it was sixth man Allen Crabbe who led the team's offensive push on Thursday.  Crabbe came off the bench and shot 8-of-12 en route to a team-high 25 points to go along with five rebounds and three assists.  Thanks in large part to Crabbe, Portland enjoyed a major advantage in bench scoring.  The Blazers held a 37-13 edge in points off the bench.  Point guard Damian Lillard also enjoyed a stellar game, scoring 22 points to go along with nine rebounds and eight assists.  

Minnesota (31-47) has been eliminated from playoff contention but still put up a strong fight on Thursday night.  It was a particularly great night for the young dynamic duo of Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns.  Wiggins led the game with 36 points on 14-of-27 shooting to go along with eight rebounds.  Towns, meanwhile, had a massive double-double, recording 24 points, 16 rebounds, a block and a steal.  The rest of the team, however, had some struggles, as they shot just 43 percent from the field as a unit and saw only 13 points off the bench.  

The Timberwolves will visit Utah on Friday, while Portland will host the Jazz on Saturday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 112-99, at Spectrum Center on Wednesday night. 

The Heat (38-40) came into Wednesday knowing that a win would vault them back to the coveted eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. Miami had a tall order in front of them, however, as the Hornets (36-43) owned a winning record at home and were fighting for that eighth spot in their own right, although from a less advantageous position than their visitors. As it turned out, it was the Heat that looked considerably more postseason-worthy, utilizing a big third quarter to pull away from the double-digit road win. The duo of Goran Dragic and James Johnson were spectacular while combining for 59 points, and Hassan Whiteside posted a huge double-double down low on a night in which Miami won the rebounding battle by a 40-36 margin. 

Dragic led the way with a game-high 33 points, which he supplemented with four assists, one rebound and two steals. Johnson tallied 26 points, four boards, three assists and two steals. Josh Richardson was next with 19 points, six rebounds, five assists and one block. Whiteside managed a 13-point, 20-rebound double-double that also included three blocks and one steal. Tyler Johnson led the way for the bench with 12 points, three assists and two rebounds.

Nicolas Batum set the pace for Charlotte, supplying 24 points, seven assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block. Kemba Walker registered 18 points, five assists and two rebounds. Marvin Williams pitched in with a 15-point, 12-rebound double-double. Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each submitted eight-point efforts, while Frank Kaminsky led the second unit with 13 points, one rebound and one assist.

The Heat next head to Toronto for a Friday night showdown with the Raptors, while the Hornets remain home to tangle with the Boston Celtics on Saturday evening.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Detroit Pistons, 105-102, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday. 

This game was full of swings, as Toronto made a huge comeback to put Detroit's playoff hopes in jeopardy. In fact, the Raptors trailed by 12 headed into the fourth quarter, but proceeded to outscore the Pistons, 37-22, in the fourth quarter to comeback and win. Free-throw shooting was a huge factor, as Detroit went just 11-of-18 from the charity stripe, while Toronto hit 13-of-15. The Raptors also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording seven more assists than Detroit, while committing three less turnovers. 

The Raptors (48-31) got Kyle Lowry back from a wrist injury after a two-month absence and his presence in this comeback shows how important he is to this team. Lowry led Toronto, as he tallied 27 points, five rebounds, 10 assists and two steals. Jonas Valanciunas finished second on the team, as he totaled 19 points and five rebounds on 9-of-11 shooting. DeMar DeRozan went just 5-of-17 from the field, but still finished with 12 points, four rebounds and 10 assists. Cory Joseph played well off the bench, as he provided 15 points, five rebounds and two steals. On deck for the Raptors is a home matchup versus the Miami Heat on Friday. 

The Pistons (35-43) are fighting for a playoff berth and blown leads like this are devastating for that pursuit. Ish Smith led the starters, as he accumulated 16 points, four rebounds and six assists. Tobias Harris matched those 16 points to lead the bench. Andre Drummond recorded a double-double, totaling 11 points and 14 rebounds. Detroit will look to stay alive on Friday in a road matchup against the Houston Rockets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 103-100, at FedEx Forum on Wednesday night.

All eyes were on Russell Westbrook even more so than usual, as he entered Wednesday's contest just one triple-double short of breaking Oscar Robertson's NBA record for most in a season. However, the game had larger implications, as the Thunder (45-33) were also trying to stave off the Grizzlies (42-37) for the sixth seed in the Western Conference. As expected, the high-stakes game was a tightly-contested one, with Memphis closing an early 34-27 first-quarter deficit. Fittingly, the outcome came down to the final seconds, with Westbrook's key 25-foot three-pointer with 14 seconds remaining providing Oklahoma City with a 101-97 cushion. Andrew Harrison's own trey with under a second left closed the gap to one, but Westbrook drained a pair of free throws for the final margin of victory. 

As customary, the Thunder's stat sheet was decidedly top-heavy. Westbrook led the way while falling just short of Robertson's record, as he posted 45 points, 10 assists, nine rebounds and five steals. Victor Oladipo filled his usual role as a distant second option, pouring in 15 points and adding five assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block. Steven Adams mustered a modest five points but hauled in 10 rebounds and added an assist and a block. Taj Gibson pitched in with eight points, seven rebounds and one steal, while Doug McDermott and Enes Kanter led the bench with a pair of 10-point efforts.

The Grizzlies were led by Marc Gasol, who tallied 23 points, five rebounds, five assists, four blocks and two steals. Zach Randolph followed with a bench-leading 20 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, one assist and one steal. Tony Allen contributed 14 points, seven boards, four assists and two steals. Harrison, starting for the injured Mike Conley (eye), registered 12 points, three rebounds and three assists. Vince Carter provided 10 points, two rebounds and two assists. 

The Thunder travel to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Friday night, while the Grizzlies are home against the Knicks on Friday evening as well.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets, 110-104, at Toyota Center on Wednesday. 

In a game with major playoff implications, both these teams left it all on the floor. Despite there being just five ties and five lead changes in total, the game was within a six-point margin for the final 20 minutes. Three-point shooting killed the Nuggets, as they went 7-of-38 from long range, while the Rockets hit 10-of-34. Houston took care of the defensive rebounding, as they won that battle, 45-39. Despite Denver winning the turnover differential for the game, they committed six of their 12 turnovers in the fourth quarter. 

The Nuggets (37-41) came into this game just one game out of the eight-seed in the West, as this loss is devastating for that goal. Danilo Gallinari led Denver, as he tallied 23 points, five rebounds and three assists. Nikola Jokic flirted with a triple-double, accumulating 12 points, 19 rebounds, nine assists and five steals. Gary Harris finished with 17 points, while Wilson Chandler dropped 16 points and five rebounds off the bench. On deck for Denver is a home matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. 

The Rockets (53-25) are secure in the three-seed in the West, but they're still playing hard night after night. James Harden led the way, as he collected 31 points, seven rebounds, 10 assists and three blocks. Clint Capela recorded a double-double, totaling 15 points and 11 rebounds. Patrick Beverley finished with nine points, 11 rebounds and two steals. Trevor Ariza amassed 15 points and 10 rebounds. Nene Hilario was a nice spark off the bench, providing 16 points, four rebounds and two assists on 7-of-8 shooting. Houston's next game will be on Friday against the Detroit Pistons.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics, 114-91, Wednesday at TD Garden. 

The Cavaliers (51-27) came into Wednesday's contest with revenge on their minds, and following a low-scoring, tightly contested first quarter that saw the Celtics (50-28) take a one-point lead, the motivation kicked in; at least for LeBron James it did. James launched a 22-4 run to open up the second quarter and he and his teammates never looked back, as Boston was unable to get much closer than that throughout the remainder of Wednesday's game. James finished with a game-high 36 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in 39 minutes as his team avenged their last-second loss at Boston earlier in the season. Each of the other four Cleveland starters joined James in reaching double figures in the scoring column, but the story of the game was their defense. 

The Cavaliers' defensive effort was their best in a long time, as 91 points is the fewest they've given up since March 16 against the Jazz. The Celtics managed to shoot just 40.7 percent from the field, 21.2 percent from behind the arc, and to make matters even worse, 62 percent from the free throw line. It was the first time in nine games that Boston failed to score at least 100 points and their lowest point total since they scored 88 against the Warriors on Nov. 18. Isaiah Thomas still managed to lead the way with a team-high 26 points to go along with six assists and four rebounds, but no other Celtic scored more than 13 points in the loss. 

The win for Cleveland moves them one game ahead of the Celtics for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with just four games remaining for each team.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 102-95, Wednesday at AT&T Center. 

On a night where Spurs (60-18) head coach Gregg Popovich decided to rest his key players for the majority of the game, the Lakers (23-55) decided to take advantage, and they wasted no time doing so. After one quarter, Los Angeles had opened up their lead to 17 points, and that lead eventually grew to as much as 26 in the first half. San Antonio, even without their star players playing heavy minutes on a back-to-back, managed to trim the lead and get it to a tie early in the fourth quarter. 

Unfortunately for them, they never could get over the hump thanks in large part to Tyler Ennis, who got the spot start at point guard with D'Angelo Russell out with a knee injury. Ennis led the way for the Lakers with a game-high 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting from the field and six assists in 39 minutes. Jordan Clarkson wasn't too far behind with 17 points, and in total, Los Angeles had five players score in double figures. In the end, the Lakers allowed their hot shooting to carry them to victory, as they hit 48.8 percent of their field goal attempts and 50 percent from behind the arc. 

As for the Spurs, it was essentially a night off for them, as Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol all played 18 minutes or less. Somehow, Tony Parker managed to tie for the team-lead in points Wednesday night, as he scored 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting in just 16 minutes, with Davis Bertans matching him with 14 points of his own off the bench. In all, four Spurs did manage to hit double-digit scoring totals, but they ended up just hitting 43.8 percent of their field goal attempts in the losing effort.

												Despite a close game down the stretch, the visiting Golden State Warriors managed to beat the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, 120-111.

Golden State (65-14) clinched the league's best record for the third straight season with the win.  The team also extended its league-best win streak to 13 games.  It was almost inevitable that the Warriors would walk away with the win after they started the game with a 40-18 first quarter advantage.  Despite that, however, Phoenix was able to bring the game back to a nail-biter by the late fourth quarter.  Still, it was tough for the Suns to do anything to stop reigning MVP Steph Curry.  Curry scored a team-high 42 points while dishing out 11 assists.  The other ""Splash Brother,"" Klay Thompson, added 22 points.  On the whole, the Dubs shot 50 percent on the night and made 13 three-pointers.  

Phoenix (22-57) dropped its 13th consecutive game and continues to sit at the bottom of the Western Conference.  The Suns shot only 41 percent on the night on Wednesday, but kept things close with Golden State thanks to strong rebounding.  Phoenix held a 55-40 advantage on the boards and pulled down a whopping 20 offensive rebounds.  At the heart of the rebounding effort was young big man Alan Williams, who had a 16-point, 17-rebound double-double in just 25 minutes of play.

On Friday, Phoenix will host OKC, while Golden State will host the Pelicans on Saturday.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers took down the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, 112-101.

The Clippers (48-31) have now won four straight and are seeing their ""Big Three"" come together as the end of the season draws near.  On Wednesday, All-Star forward Blake Griffin scored 32 points while dishing out six assists, and superstar point guard Chris Paul had a 22-point, 11-assist double-double.  Center DeAndre Jordan, meanwhile, stole the show with a whopping 20 rebounds and 11 points on 4-of-5 shooting.  The team saw stellar 51 percent shooting from the field and drained 12 three-pointers on the night.

Dallas (32-46) is now left hoping for better lottery position as the team has been eliminated from playoff contention.  Shooting guard Seth Curry sat out of action again due to injury, leaving a depleted Mavs team to take on the scorching-hot Clippers.  Five players ended up scoring in double digits for the team, but the team-high proved to be just 15.  As a whole, Dallas shot only 44 percent from the field.  They also struggled with turnovers, committing 16 on the night.  

The Mavericks will host the Spurs on Friday, while the Clippers will visit the Spurs on Saturday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 118-114, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday night.

The Sixers (28-50) checked into Tuesday having lost three straight games and hoping that a return to their home court would prove to be the cure for what ailed them. On paper, they appeared to have the right matchup to capitalize on, as the Nets (19-59), although improved as of late, were still sporting a 6-31 road record at the start of the night. Nothing could have prepared Philadelphia for the onslaught they were subjected to, as Brooklyn tied a franchise record with 81 first-half points. They shot 70 percent and made 12-of-17 three-pointers during the first two quarters and saw eight players hit double digits in the scoring column. Four of those efforts came from the second unit, which collectively tallied a whopping 78 points on the night. Overall, Brooklyn posted a jaw-dropping 64 percent success rate from the field, along with an excellent 51.6 percent figure from three-point range.

Brook Lopez and Jeremy Lin led the Nets with matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding four rebounds, one assist and three blocks and the latter providing seven assists, five boards and two steals. Archie Goodwin and K.J. McDaniels followed with 14-point contributions off the bench. Goodwin added two rebounds, two assists and a steal, while McDaniels collected two rebounds and one assist. Sean Kilpatrick and Spencer Dinwiddie had 13 points apiece, along with three rebounds, three assists and a steal for Kilpatrick and seven assists, two rebounds and two steals for Dinwiddie. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (12 points, three rebounds and two assists) and Randy Foye (12 points, three boards, two assists and two steals) rounded out the double-digit scoring.

The Sixers were led by promising rookie Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, who totaled 19 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Shawn Long was next with a bench-leading 18 points, which he supplemented with six boards and two assists. Richaun Holmes totaled 16 points, six rebounds, four assists, three blocks and one steal. Justin Anderson contributed 13 points, three assists and two rebounds. T.J. McConnell matched Anderson's point total and complemented it with seven assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Dario Saric had a modest night with 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Alex Poythress matched Saric's point total off the bench.

The Nets next head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Thursday evening while the Sixers are home against the Chicago Bulls that same night.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 118-111, at Verizon Center on Tuesday.

Charlotte needed to win this game to keep their playoff hopes alive, but this loss may be the nail in their coffin. The third quarter is what really changed the result, with Washington turning a 12-point deficit into a six-point lead. Both teams were efficient on offense, as they both shot 51 percent from the field. The Wizards dominated from long distance though, hitting 17-of-34 from three-point range, while Charlotte went just 12-of-34. Washington also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording 10 more assists than the Hornets, while committing two less turnovers. 

The Hornets (36-42) are trying to get back to the eight-seed in the East, but this loss is devastating for pursuit. Kemba Walker did all he could though, as he led them with 37 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Marco Belinelli finished second on the team, as he provided 16 points, three rebounds and two assists off the bench. Nicolas Batum accrued 13 points and eight assists. Cody Zeller totaled 10 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double-double. On deck for the Hornets is a home matchup versus the Miami Heat on Wednesday. 

The Wizards (49-31) are now tied with the Toronto Raptors for the three-seed in the East, as they continue their amazing season. John Wall led them once again, as he collected 23 points, 13 assists and six steals. Bradley Beal amassed 19 points, two rebounds, four assists and three steals. Jason Smith and Kelly Oubre Jr. were huge off the bench, as they combined for 32 points, 10 rebounds and three assists. Washington's next game is on Thursday against the New York Knicks.

The Cavaliers (50-27) are trying to stack up as many wins as possible, in an effort to both keep up with the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference and to restore some of the confidence they lost during a recent extended skid. However, matters weren't looking too promising in the first half against the inferior Magic (27-51) on Tuesday, as Orlando actually entered halftime with a 55-53 lead. Cleveland came out of the locker room a new team, though, taking the third period by a score of 43-20. That gave them the cushion necessary to ride to a relatively comfortable victory, one that saw them shoot 53.7 and 50 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively.

Evan Fournier led the way for Orlando with 21 points, which he supplemented with one assist and two steals. Mario Hezonja followed with a bench-leading 13 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Elfrid Payton, Terrence Ross and Aaron Gordon were next with a trio of 12-point efforts. Payton added six assists and four rebounds, Ross provided three assists, one rebound and two steals and Gordon tallied five rebounds in addition to his scoring. Nikola Vucevic compiled a modest six points but also hauled in 10 rebounds, dished out two assists, and recorded a steal and a block. Jodie Meeks was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, six boards, three assists and two steals.

Kevin Love paced Cleveland with 28 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block. Kyrie Irving supplied 24 points, eight assists, four rebounds and one steal. J.R. Smith poured in 19 points and added five rebounds and three assists. LeBron James contributed an 18-point, 11-rebound, 11-assist triple-double that also included two steals and one block. Kyle Korver led the bench with 11 points, one rebound and one assist.

The Magic head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night while the Cavs head to Beantown for a pivotal showdown against the Celtics on Wednesday evening.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Toronto Raptors, 108-90, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Tuesday. 

Indiana needed this game to keep playoff hopes alive and they rode a furious comeback to increase their odds. In fact, after trailing by 11 at the half, the Pacers outscored the Raptors, 68-39, in the second half to comeback and win by 18. The big advantage for Indiana was their shooting, as they dominated the three-point shooting, while going a perfect 18-of-18 from the free-throw line. The Pacers ended up shooting 12-of-25 from long distance, while Toronto went just 5-of-23. 

The Raptors (47-31) are now tied with the Washington Wizards for the three-seed in the East, as this loss could cause complications for playoff positioning. DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto, as he tallied 27 points, three rebounds, two assists and three steals. Jonas Valanciunas recorded a double-double, totaling 10 points and 10 rebounds. Serge Ibaka went just 3-of-13 from the field to finish with eight points and 10 rebounds. Toronto's next game will be on Wednesday in a road matchup versus the Detroit Pistons. 

The Pacers (38-40) desperately needed this win with their playoff hopes slimming and this win showed some serious resiliency. Paul George scored a game-high 35 points to add to his 10 rebounds, three assists and two steals. Thaddeus Young accrued 15 points, 11 rebounds and two steals. Jeff Teague collected 20 points and six assists. Lance Stephenson came off the bench to provide 12 points, two rebounds and three assists in his return to Indy. On deck for the Pacers is a home matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 134-131, at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday evening.

Both the Nuggets (37-40) and Pelicans (33-45) came in as Western Conference playoff hopefuls striving to keep postseason hopes alive. However, New Orleans faced elimination with a loss, which gave them an extra dose of motivation while playing in front of their home crowd. The game unfolded exactly as one with as high a stakes should, with both teams seemingly matching each other point-for-point through the majority of four quarters. In the end, it came down to some crucial fourth-quarter sequences, including a pair of late threes from DeMarcus Cousins, with the second tying the game at 131 with 30.5 seconds remaining. However, Jrue Holiday turned the ball over twice in the last minute, with both miscues leading to crucial Nuggets free throws. Holiday had a chance for redemption as time expired, but his 27-foot three-point attempt couldn't find the net. As expected in such a high-scoring affair, both teams were excellent from the field, with New Orleans posting a 51.0 percent success rate and Denver countering with a 53.5 percent figure. 

Danilo Gallinari led the way for Denver with 28 points, five rebounds and three assists. Gary Harris filled out the stat sheet with 23 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two steals. Nikola Jokic managed a 21-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included four assists. Wilson Chandler followed with a bench-leading 18 points, which he supplemented with seven boards and two assists. Jamal Murray tallied 16 points, five rebounds, five assists and one steal. Emmanuel Mudiay (15 points, seven assists) and Mason Plumlee (13 points, 11 boards, three assists and a block) were productive as reserves as well.

Anthony Davis paced the Pelicans with 41 points, five rebounds, four blocks and one steal. Cousins contributed a near triple-double of 30 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists, two blocks and one steal. Despite the unfortunate turn of events in the final seconds, Holiday turned in an impressive game, posting an 18-point 13-assist double-double that also included four rebounds, a steal and a block. Solomon Hill compiled 15 points, four rebounds, one block and one steal. E'Twaun Moore led the second unit with 13 points, three rebounds, three assists and one block.

The Nuggets next travel to the Lone Star State to tangle with the Houston Rockets on Wednesday evening, while the Pelicans head to the Mile High City for a rematch with Denver on Friday night.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 110-79, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Tuesday. 

This game was expected to be close, but Oklahoma City had other ideas. In fact, the Thunder led by 24 at half and 30 headed into a non-competitive fourth quarter. Rebounding was huge for Oklahoma City, as they won that battle, 53-38. They also dominated the shooting, hitting 48 percent of their shots, while holding Milwaukee to just 36 percent from the field. A 54-40 scoring in the paint differential was a huge factor for the Thunder as well. All the talk will be around Russell Westbrook though, as he tied Oscar Robertsonl's record for the most triple-doubles in a season, as Westbrook picked up his 41st on the year in this win. 

The Bucks (40-38) are fending off numerous teams for the final few playoff spots in the East and non-competitive losses like this certainty can't help that pursuit. Giannis Antetokounmpo tallied 11 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Michael Beasley led the team in scoring, as he dropped 14 points off the bench. On deck for Milwaukee is a road matchup with the Indiana Pacers on Thursday. 

The Thunder (44-33) have rode Westbrook all season long and he recorded his 41st triple-double in just three quarters of action in this blowout victory. Westbrook finished the game with 12 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists. Enes Kanter was huge off the bench, as he provided 17 points, five rebounds and two steals. Andre Roberson had a nice all-around game, collecting four points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals and three blocks. Westbrook will look to set that record on Wednesday, when the Thunder travel to face the Memphis Grizzlies for their next game.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 100-91, Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. 

Tuesday's contest ended up being a major letdown for the Bulls (38-40) but an impressive win for the struggling Knicks (30-48) who were without both Kristaps Porzingis (back) and Derrick Rose (knee). They did, however, get Carmelo Anthony back after their star missed the previous two games with his own back problems, and he managed to lead the team offensively with a team-high 23 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes in a game that New York led convincingly from start to finish. As a team, it wasn't the most impressive offensive performance from the Knicks, as they shot just 26 percent from behind the arc and 62.5 percent from the free throw line, but in the end, five different players managing to score in double figures was enough to get the job done. 

As for Chicago, Tuesday's loss was simply one they couldn't afford, as while they are still technically in the playoffs in the East, they are now tied with the Pacers and just a half-game ahead of the Heat, who are now barely on the outside looking in.  Jimmy Butler lead the way for the Bulls with a game-high 26 points, while Nikola Mirotic added 21 points of his own, but they weren't fortunate enough to get much help offensively, as four different Chicago players who played at least 14 minutes failed to score more than five points. As a team, they shot just 38.1 percent from the field and 22.2 percent from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Bulls will look to stay alive in the playoff chase Thursday against the 76ers, while the Knicks will remain home Thursday and play the Wizards.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 95-89, in overtime Tuesday at AT&T Center. 

It was a low-scoring, back-and-forth affair Tuesday night, which kept the game relatively close throughout the the original 48 minutes of the contest. With the Spurs (60-17) looking to pull away with just over three minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Grizzlies (42-36) managed to go on a quick 8-0 spurt that put them up by one point with a minute and a half remaining. For the final minute of Tuesday's game, the teams went on to trade baskets, with three made buckets coming in the last four seconds and putting the game into overtime. From there, it was all Spurs, who dominated on the defensive end throughout the extra period to earn the victory. 

Kawhi Leonard put together yet another tremendous performance for San Antonio, finishing with a game-high 32 points to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists in 40 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge added 15 points and six rebounds of his own in 41 minutes, while Pau Gasol came off the bench to notch a double-double himself, posting 12 points and 11 boards in 31 minutes as a reserve. As a team, the Spurs were absolutely on fire from downtown, shooting 11-of-21 (52.4 percent) from behind the arc. 

As for the Grizzlies, they battled hard despite dealing with multiple injuries to their star players, as Mike Conley was forced to leave injury after an eye injury, while Marc Gasol was limited with a foot injury and held out of the overtime period as a result. Conley still managed to lead the team in scoring with 19 points to go along with six assists in 33 minutes, but the biggest performance came off the bench from Zach Randolph, who finished with a double-double of 18 points and 16 rebounds in 35 minutes as a reserve. Overall, however, it was a struggle offensively for Memphis on Tuesday night, as they managed to hit just 39.3 percent of their shots from the field.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 106-87, Tuesday at Vivint Smart Home Arena.

The Jazz started the game on a quick 11-0 run, and while the Trail Blazers ultimately fought back hard to take a 31-30 lead in the second quarter, that lead ended up lasting just 15 seconds and it would be the last lead they would have all game. From that point on, Utah started to roll once again and ultimately walked off their home floor with a convincing 19-point victory. Gordon Hayward lead the way for the Jazz with a game-high 30 points on 12-of-20 shooting from the field, while Rudy Gobert shot a perfect 6-of-6 from the field and 8-of-10 from the charity stripe in route to recording 20 points to go along with 11 rebounds and three blocks. In the end, six different Utah players managed to score in double figures as the team shot the lights out Tuesday night. As a team, the Jazz hit 53.4 percent of their field goals overall and an even more impressive 56.5 percent of their threes in the victory. 

As for Portland, they have now dropped two straight games after rattling off six straight wins and now find themselves just a half-game ahead of the Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. C.J. McCollum had a strong outing, shooting 11-of-22 from the field en route to scoring a team-high 25 points, but it ended up being a night to forget for his sidekick Damian Lillard. Lillard shot an abysmal 5-of-20 from the field en route to scoring just 16 points in 34 minutes, and beyond the backcourt, only one other Trail Blazer managed to score in double figures, with Al-Farouq Aminu scoring a light 11 points in 31 minutes. As a team, Portland accumulated just 10 total assists and shot a poor 39.8 percent from the field.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday, 121-107.

Golden State (64-14) continues to roll, winning its 12th straight game against the Wolves.

As a team, the Warriors saw an impressive offensive night, shooting over 52 percent and hitting a superb 14 three-pointers.  The Dubs also dished out a massive 33 assists, with nine coming from two-time reigning MVP Steph Curry.

Minnesota (31-46) kept with the Warriors in the first half but fell victim to yet another dominant Warriors third quarter.

Wiggins finished with 24 points, tying bench forward Shabazz Muhammad for the team lead.  Muhammad also pulled down 11 rebounds on the night.

												The host Sacramento Kings took down the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, 98-87.

Sacramento (31-47) blew by the Mavericks at the end of the game after a tied game leading up to the mid-fourth quarter.  Play was fairly strong on the offensive end, as the Kings shot 45 percent from the field and sunk 12 three-pointers.  The leader of the Kings' scoring charge was bench guard Ben McLemore, who shot 8-of-13 for 22 points on the night.  They also dominated on the boards, out-rebounding the Mavericks by a margin of 50-39.  

Dallas (32-45) stayed in the game until roughly seven minutes remained, but finished out the game rolling out a lineup of almost entirely bench players.  The Kings managed to take a double-digit lead on the Mavericks as the fourth quarter began to wane.  Offense proved to be a major issue for the Mavs, as the team shot just 40 percent on the night.  Only three players scored in double figures and saw forward Nicolas Brussino lead the team with just 13 points.  The Mavericks also struggled to reach the free-throw line, attempting only 14 free-throws on the night.  

The Mavericks will visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, while the Kings will visit the Lakers on Friday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 110-109, at Target Center on Monday night.

Two offensively-potent squads engaged in the type of game that would be expected of them, with each unit seemingly taking turns racking up points on each other throughout the first three periods. Matters tightened up in the fourth, a quarter which the Timberwolves (31-45) had entered holding a slim 86-83 lead. The Trail Blazers (38-39) got within one with an Al-Farouq Aminu basket with 30 seconds remaining but could get no closer, with Damian Lillard missing a would-be game-winning 17-footer as time expired that sent Minnesota home victors. The Timberwolves shot a stellar 49.4 percent from the field while winning the rebounding battle by a 43-35 margin.

Lillard led the way with 25 points, six assists, four rebounds and two steals. Aminu followed with a bench-leading 20 points, which he supplemented with seven boards, five assists and three blocks.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the New York Knicks, 110-94, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon.

The Knicks (29-48) came into Sunday's matchup knowing that they'd once again be playing without some of their most potent offensive pieces in Carmelo Anthony (back) and Derrick Rose (knee). That naturally led to low expectations against a Celtics (50-27) squad that was gunning for their 50th win of the season and trying to keep hold of the top spot in the Eastern Conference. The game played out more or less as expected, as Boston utilized a balanced offensive effort and a 34-23 first quarter to cruise to a relatively comfortable victory. The Celtics enjoyed a stellar shooting performance (55.6 percent) and played excellent defense, allowing them to overcome a rather sloppy 17 turnovers. 

Isaiah Thomas led the way for the visitors with 19 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Jaylen Brown posted 16 points, two boards and one assist. Al Horford followed with 14 points, seven rebounds and one assist. Marcus Smart matched Horford's scoring total off the bench and added five assists, two rebounds and one steal. Kelly Olynyk and Terry Rozier were productive as reserves as well with 12-point efforts. Amir Johnson contributed nine points and three rebounds and Jae Crowder tallied eight points, five boards and one steal before exiting after 28 minutes with an elbow injury. 

The Knicks were paced by Courtney Lee, who pitched in 16 points, five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Kristaps Porzingis was next with 14 points, one rebound and one steal. Willy Hernangomez supplied 12 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Mindaugas Kuzminskas and Kyle O'Quinn led the second unit with a pair of 11-point efforts, with the former adding one rebound and one assist and the latter registering nine boards and two blocks. Chasson Randle poured in 10 points and added three assists, two rebounds and one steal over 22 minutes as a reserve.

The Celtics head back home for a pivotal showdown with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday evening, while the Knicks are off until Tuesday night when the face the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night at home as well.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 113-101, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday afternoon.

There is naturally no actual downside to having Russell Westbrook on your squad, but his mere presence can often serve to elevate the game of the opposing point guard. The motivation of playing against the best in the league seemed to give Kemba Walker, an All-Star in his own right, a bit of an extra step Sunday, as he led the Hornets (36-41) to a crucial upset road victory with 29 points, four assists, three rebounds and four steals. Walker was an outstanding 10-of-20 from the field overall and 6-of-12 from three-point range. Still in the hunt for a postseason berth, Charlotte came out strong in the first and third quarters, outscoring the Thunder (43-33) by a combined 56-38 margin during those periods. Although Westbrook did contribute yet another triple-double with 40 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists and three steals, the Hornets played solid defense overall, causing 24 turnovers.

Frank Kaminsky followed Walker with a bench-leading 18 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, two steals and one block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist followed with 16 points, six boards, one assist and two steals. Jeremy Lamb was productive as a reserve as well with 13 points, three boards and one steal. Cody Zeller contributed 11 points, four rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Nicolas Batum filled out the stat sheet with nine points, eight assists, seven rebounds and three steals. 

Victor Oladipo posted 19 points, six assists, three rebounds and one steal. Andre Roberson managed 12 points, six rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Enes Kanter led the bench with nine points and one rebound, while Jerami Grant was right behind him with eight points, three rebounds, one assist and one block.

The Hornets continue their quest for the playoffs with a trip to the Nation's Capital to tangle with the Wizards on Tuesday evening, while the Thunder face off with the Milwaukee Bucks at home on Tuesday night as well.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 108-103, at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon.

Despite the fact that they were playing without frontcourt starters Marc Gasol and JaMychal Green, the Grizzlies (42-35) had to be feeling fairly confident about their chances against a Lakers (22-55) squad that had dropped 10 of their last 11 games. However, Sunday happened to be one of those afternoons when Los Angeles came to play, as they forged a 50-49 halftime lead and hung close throughout the second half. A 29-23 advantage in the fourth quarter led to the victory, one that saw the Lakers shoot a solid 47.1 percent from the field and six players hit double digits in the scoring column. 

Mike Conley and Troy Daniels paced the Grizzlies with matching 20-point efforts, with the former adding 12 assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block and the latter registering three assists, two rebounds and one steal to lead the bench. Brandan Wright continued to start for Gasol and generated 16 points, three rebounds, two assists and one block. James Ennis III drew a spot start with Vince Carter resting and managed 14 points, eight boards, four assists, one steal and one block. Tony Allen contributed a near double-double with 13 points, nine boards, three assists, two steals and one block. Zach Randolph matched Allen's scoring while leading the bench and added six rebounds, one assist and one steal. 

D'Angelo Russell led the way for the home team with 28 points, six rebounds and five assists. Julius Randle produced an 18-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one steal and one block. Brandon Ingram contributed 13 points, three rebounds, one assist and one steal. Larry Nance, Jr. drew another start and tallied 12 points, 14 boards, one assist, three steals and one block. Thomas Robinson enjoyed his third consecutive solid game, posting a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one assist and two steals and led the second unit. Tyler Ennis was productive off the bench as well with 11 points, two boards, one assist and one steal.

												The Dallas Mavericks prevailed over the Milwaukee Bucks, 109-105, Sunday afternoon at BMO Harris Bradley Center.

The Mavericks (32-44) were officially eliminated from the playoffs by virtue of Portland's victory over Phoenix on Saturday night, but they displayed plenty of heart while upsetting the postseason-bound Bucks (40-37), who were looking to improve their playoff positioning. Only four Dallas players managed double-digit scoring, but the Mavs shot 52.1 percent from the field overall and outscored the Bucks by a 34-27 margin in the fourth quarter. They also maximized their free-throw opportunities, draining 19 of their 20 attempts from the charity stripe on the afternoon.

Harrison Barnes led the way for the visitors with 31 points, two rebounds and one steal. Dirk Nowitzki and J.J. Barea followed with matching 17-point efforts from the starting five and second unit, respectively. Nowitzki added five rebounds, one assist and one block while Barea supplemented his scoring with six assists and two rebounds. Yogi Ferrell produced 13 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. Wesley Matthews compiled eight points, six assists and one rebound as a complementary offensive presence.

All five members of the Bucks first unit hit double digits in the scoring column, beginning with Giannis Antetokunumpo, who totaled a near triple-double consisting of 31 points, 15 rebounds, nine assists, four steals and two blocks. Matthew Dellavedova provided 14 points, six assists and one steal in another start for Malcolm Brogdon (back). Khris Middleton tallied 13 points, five rebounds, four assists and one steal. Tony Snell poured in 12 points and added a rebound, an assist and a steal. Thon Maker supplied 11 points and one rebound. Jason Terry and Greg Monroe led the bench with modest six-point efforts.

The Mavericks next face the Sacramento Kings on the road Tuesday evening while the Bucks head to Oklahoma City for a Tuesday night showdown with the Thunder.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Utah Jazz, 109-103, at AT&T Center on Sunday. 

Despite the fact that Utah took the opening lead in this game, that was all the success they'd have. In fact, San Antonio took the lead moments after that and never relinquished it from there in a near wire-to-wire win. The first and third quarters were decisive, with the Spurs outscoring the Jazz, 67-54. San Antonio's offense was extremely efficient, as they shot 52 percent from the field, 53 percent from three-point range and 86 percent from the free-throw line. A 42-36 rebounding differential was huge for San Antonio as well. In addition, the Spurs dominated the fastbreak scoring, winning that battle, 17-2.

The Jazz (47-30) had a tough task here against the Spurs and they simply didn't have enough to pull out an upset win. Rudy Gobert was Utah's best player, as he tallied 19 points, 14 rebounds, five assists and six blocks. Boris Diaw went a perfect 9-of-9 from the field to accrue 19 points, three rebounds and two assists against his former team. Gordon Hayward finished with 16 points, three rebounds and four assists. Joe Johnson and Shelvin Mack both scored 13 points a piece off the bench. On deck for Utah is a home matchup versus the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday. 

The Spurs (59-17) have now won 30 home games in six-straight seasons, as they continue to add to the record books. Kawhi Leonard once again led the way, as he accumulated 25 points, four rebounds, seven assists and two blocks. Tony Parker collected 21 points, four rebounds and five assists. Jonathan Simmons led all bench players with 17 points, while Pau Gasol provided 13 points and 12 rebounds of his own off the pine. San Antonio will look to keep rolling on Tuesday when they host the Memphis Grizzlies for their next game.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans, 117-110, at Smoothie King Center on Sunday. 

These are two teams battling to get into the playoffs, as Chicago may have ended New Orleans season. It was a dominating win for the Bulls, as they led by at least six points for the final 30 minutes and took a 16-point lead into the half, while pulling out a wire-to-wire win. Shooting was key, as Chicago hit 49 percent of their shots, while holding New Orleans to just 41 percent from the field. Rebounding was huge as well, with Chicago winning that battle, 49-40. New Orleans couldn't slow down Chicago in transition either, as they allowed the Bulls to score 32 fastbreak points, while scoring just 12 on their end.

The Bulls (38-39) recently snuck into the seven-seed in the east, as this marks their fourth-straight win. Jimmy Butler was the player of the game, as he collected 39 points, six rebounds and five assists. Bobby Portis was huge off the bench, providing 21 points and 11 rebounds. Rajon Rondo was the only other starter in double figures, as he accumulated 10 points, nine rebounds, nine assists and three steals. Chicago will look to keep rolling on Tuesday in a road matchup versus the New York Knicks. 

The Pelicans (33-44) are now five games out of the final playoff spot in the west, as this was likely the nail in the coffin for their season. Anthony Davis led the way for New Orleans, as he totaled 30 points, 11 rebounds and three steals. DeMarcus Cousins finished with 26 points, 18 rebounds and three assists. Jrue Holiday accrued 17 points and six assists. Jordan Crawford was the only bench player in double figures, as he dropped 15 points off the Pelicans pine. New Orleans will host the Denver Nuggets for their next game on Tuesday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 113-105, at Air Canada Center on Sunday. 

Toronto were expected to win this game easily and they did just that in this eight-point win. In fact, Toronto actually rested many of their starters for the entire fourth quarter, as they led by at least six points for the final 15 minutes. The second quarter is where the Raptors separated themselves, as they outscored the Sixers, 31-20. Shooting was the difference in the game, with Toronto shooting 54 percent and Philadelphia hitting just 45 percent of their shots. The Raptors also took care of the interior, outscoring the Sixers, 58-42, in the paint. 

The Sixers (28-49) have now lost six of their last eight games, as they continue to limp to the finish line. Timothe Luwawu-Cabbarot led Philly, as he tallied 23 points and three rebounds. T.J. McConnell accrued four points, six rebounds and 11 assists. Dario Saric amassed 16 points and three rebounds. Nik Stauskas was a nice spark off the bench, producing 14 points and four assists. On deck for Philly is a home matchup versus the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday,

The Raptors (47-30) are 8-1 across their last nine games, with the one-seed in the east now being in reach. Serge Ibaka had one of his best games in a Raptors uniform, collecting 24 points, six rebounds and six blocks on 11-of-17 shooting. DeMar DeRozan finished with 17 points and nine assists. Cory Joseph got another start and provided nine points, five rebounds and six assists. Jonas Valanciunas totaled 14 points, eight rebounds and two steals on 7-of-9 from the field. Delon Wright had a nice game off the bench, accumulating four points, five assists and four steals. Toronto will look to keep rolling on Tuesday in a road matchup against the Indiana Pacers.

												The host Brooklyn Nets took down the Atlanta Hawks, 91-85, on Sunday.

Brooklyn (18-59) has actually won five games in its last eight contests despite being virtually guaranteed to finish with the league's worst record.  It was center Brook Lopez who sparked the win for Brooklyn on Sunday, as he scored 29 of the team's 91 points on the night.  Only three players scored in double figures for the Nets, as it was defense that helped them earn the win in the end.  Lopez also anchored the team on that end, blocking five shots and coming away with two steals.  

Atlanta (39-38) has been sliding badly in the standings, only worsening its situation by losing its ninth game in the last 11 outings on Sunday.  The team performed quite poorly on the offensive end, shooting just 37 points on the night and canning only seven three-pointers.  Big man Paul Millsap, who has missed the last three weeks with a knee injury, finally returned on Sunday.  He came off the bench, scoring 14 points but shooting only 4-of-14 and coming down with just four rebounds.  The team also struggled with turnovers, coughing the ball up 19 times on the night.  

The Nets will visit Philadelphia on Tuesday, while the Hawks will host the Celtics on Thursday.

												The visiting Denver Nuggets brought down another playoff hungry team, the Miami Heat, on Sunday, 116-113.

Denver (36-40) now sits only two games out of the playoffs thanks to the win on Sunday.  Sophomore big man Nikola Jokic helped the team take down Miami, as he had 19 points to go along with a team-high 10 rebounds and seven assists.  Despite only hitting five three-pointers, the Nuggets had an excellent offensive night, as the team shot almost 51 percent from the field and dished out 25 team assists.  Forward Danilo Gallinari also had a big night, scoring a team-high 29 points and coming down with five rebounds.

Miami (37-40) is fighting for a playoff spot and is now 5-6 in its last 10 matchups.  The team had a strong night on the offensive end, shooting almost 49 percent and sinking 13 three-pointers on the night.  The Heat also dished out 26 assists on the night.  Five players scored in double-digits on the night, and point guard Goran Dragic led the team with 22 points.  However, the team finished out the night with a loss and trailed for most of the night.

												The host Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Indiana Pacers on Sunday, 135-130, in double overtime.

Cleveland (49-27) walked away with the win after what was an incredibly contested game.  The Cavs almost lost the lead with 2.1 seconds remaining in the first overtime period, as a foul by Tristan Thompson sent Indiana superstar Paul George to the free-throw line with Cleveland up only one.  Fortunately for the Cavaliers, George missed the first free-throw despite being among the league's most reliable at the line (he ranks third in the NBA in free-throw percentage this season).  The three-point shot proved to be Cleveland's best friend as they sought the much-needed win.  The Cavs hit 18 three-pointers, including two from sharpshooter J.R. Smith in the overtime periods that helped seal the deal for Cleveland.  Much of the win was also attributable to four-time MVP LeBron James, who had his 53rd career triple-double and a team-high 41 points.  The Cavs remain within half a game of first place thanks to the win.

Indiana (37-40) fought hard on Sunday but has still lost four straight games after the Cavs ended up victorious.  The loss came despite a season-high 43 points from star forward Paul George.  George added nine assists and nine rebounds while dueling with Cleveland's LeBron James.  The team also relied heavily on the three-point shot, hitting 16 threes on the night, just one shy of their season-high.  One of the team's issues was rebounding, as the Cavaliers held a 10-rebound edge over the Pacers on the night.  However, the Pacers did manage to find extra possessions with excellent ball management.  The team had only nine turnovers despite two overtime periods.

On Tuesday, the Cavaliers will host the Magic, while the Pacers will host the Raptors.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Washington Wizards 139-115 at Oracle Arena on Sunday. 

The Warriors (63-14) grabbed their 11th straight win and had Stephen Curry on fire with 42 points on 15-of-22 shooting including nine three pointers. Curry also surpassed the 300 three-pointers made mark for the second straight season, although he is below his other worldly 402 three's he made in 2015-2016. The reigning MVP added eight assists, one rebound and one steal in the blow out victory. Klay Thompson added 23 points on 9-of-20 shooting, while Draymond Green pitched in a triple-double with 11 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds. Golden State had the benefit of their bench, which ran seven players deep. Matt Barnes, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston all saw 20-plus minutes of action, with Livingston being the most efficient amongst them as he finished with 17 points and seven rebounds on 8-of-10 shooting.

The Wizards (46-31) have been strong in the second half of the season and turned around their road woes, however, the Warriors high pace offense and Curry's ability to score three-pointers at will proved to much to handle. The loss puts them behind the Raptors for the 3-seed in the Eastern Conference, and the Raptors also hold the tiebreaker on the season. John Wall finished with 15 points and 11 assists, while Bradley Beal scored 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting. Bojan Bogdanovic was a bright spot off the bench once the rout was on, and contributed 20 points and six rebounds across 29 minutes of action. 

Both teams play on Tuesday, as the Warriors host the Minnesota Timberwolves, while the Wizards host the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns 123-116 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday. 

The Rockets (52-25) had James Harden sidelined with the flu, which worked favorably into their schedule given the last placed Western Conference team, the Suns (22-56) were the opponent. The win also made it a 4-0 season sweep for Houston, and they got the job done with Patrick Beverley, Eric Gordon and Lou Williams. The three guards rotated in the backcourt and all scored 20-plus points while also logging 30-plus minutes each. Aside from the second quarter, where the Suns outscored the Rockets 33-28, Houston had some trouble staving off Phoenix comeback attempts, but nothing they weren't able to handle down the stretch. 

Beverley led the way with 26 points, nine assists and three rebounds on 11-of-19 shooting, while Gordon finished with 22 points, five assists, six boards, three blocks and one steal across 37 minutes. Troy Williams drew the start at small forward, and also found his way to 20-plus points after he finished with 21 points, three dimes and five rebounds on 7-of-12 shooting. Williams pitched in 23 points off the bench, while Clint Capela was strong on the glass in the starting rotation and contributed eight points and 12 rebounds. 

Tyler Ulis had a career night with 34 points on 15-of-22 shooting for the Suns, and the small rookie guard played big across the box score after he added nine assists and nine rebounds in a whopping 45 minutes. Devin Booker found his shooting rhythm late, but finished with 27 points, nine assists and five rebounds. 

Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Suns host the Golden State Warriors, while the Rockets host the Denver Nuggets.

												The Los Angeles Clippers beat the Los Angeles Lakers, 115-104, at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon.

The Clippers (47-31) checked into Saturday's contest riding a winning wave that had seen them notch victories in six of the previous eight contests. Linchpins Blake Griffin and Chris Paul have been especially proficient as of late, and that pattern would repeat itself again Saturday. The dynamic duo combined for 65 points on outstanding 21-of-29 shooting, and Los Angeles tallied a 55.1 percent success rate from the field overall. The Lakers (21-55) hung tough, however, trailing only 55-50 at the half. However, the Clippers came out of halftime on a mission to put some distance between them and their in-town rivals and accomplished the feat by hanging 38 points on them in the third period. That helped build a 21-point lead heading into the final 12 minutes, one that the Lakers made some, but not enough, inroads against.

Promising prospect David Nwaba actually led the Lakers on the day with 19 points, six rebounds, one assist and two steals in 35 minutes off the bench. Brandon Ingram paced the starting five with 18 points, five boards, three assists, one steal and one block in his return from a three-game absence due to a knee injury. Thomas Robinson, seeing extended action as part of the trickle-down effect of Ivica Zubac's season-ending ankle injury, managed 16 points, nine boards, three assists and one steal. Julius Randle totaled 14 points, six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Larry Nance, Jr. drew the start and supplied eight points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. 

Griffin led the way with 36 points, eight boards, five assists and one steal. Paul was right behind with 29 points, 12 assists, four boards and one steal.  J.J. Redick poured in 19 points and added five boards, two assists and one steal. DeAndre Jordan posted an 11-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included an assist, three steals and two blocks. 

The Lakers remain at Staples Center to tangle with the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday afternoon and the Clippers also have a home date in their next contest, which is Wednesday night versus the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 106-104, at United Center on Saturday. 

In a battle between two teams trying to achieve a playoff berth, they left it all on the line in this close-fought battle. While there were only nine ties and nine lead changes in total, neither team led by more than 10 points. Jimmy Butler was the hero, as he hit two free-throws with two seconds left to take the lead and eventually win the game. Shooting was key for Chicago, as they hit 47 percent of their shots, while holding Atlanta to just 44 percent. The Bulls were also perfect from the free-throw line, as they went 14-of-14, with the Hawks hitting 13-of-17. 

The Hawks (39-37) have now lost eight of their last 10 games, as they're backpedaling their way into the postseason.

In fact, Charlotte outscored Denver, 36-20, in the fourth quarter to pull out the comeback victory. Defense was key for the Hornets, as they recorded 10 steals and 11 blocks, while winning the turnover differential, 13-6. Another key for Charlotte was the free-throw shooting, as they went 25-of-30 from the charity stripe, while Denver went just 8-of-11. Bench production really boosted the Hornets as well, outscoring the Nuggets bench, 50-19.

The Nuggets (35-40) have now lost three-straight games, as they find themselves two games out of the eight-seed in the west. Nikola Jokic did record his sixth triple-double in the defeat though, as he collected 26 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists on 11-of-16 shooting. Gary Harris finished second on the team, totaling 20 points, five rebounds and three assists. Kenneth Faried got a rare start and provided 18 points and 13 rebounds. Danilo Gallinari tallied 19 points, five rebounds and four assists. Jameer Nelson put in 12 points and nine assists before departing with a calf injury in the third quarter. 

The Hornets (35-41) are now just two games behind the Indiana Pacers for the eight-seed in the east, as this win was crucial for that pursuit. Kemba Walker was the player of the game, as he accumulated 31 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Nicolas Batum amassed 13 points, five rebounds and nine assists. Marvin Williams, Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist led the defense by combining for 24 rebounds, seven steals and eight blocks as the starting frontcourt. Frank Kaminsky was a huge spark off the bench, dropping 22 points in 27 minutes. 

Both teams travel on Sunday for their next game, with Denver playing the Miami Heat and Charlotte facing the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 122-105, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday evening.

The Cavaliers (48-27) checked into Friday's contest in serious need for a victory, as they'd dropped four out of five and actually found themselves displaced from their customary top perch in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland knew they'd have to be wary of a considerably improved Philadelphia squad that had already played them tough in two prior games this season. The first quarter was more of the same, as the hosts emerged with a razor-thin 32-29 edge. However, LeBron James and company turned on the after-burners over the middle periods, outscoring the Sixers by a 72-48 margin over the second and third periods. The Cavs saw four members of the first unit post double digits in the scoring column and they shot a stellar 52.6 percent from the field and 44.8 percent from three-point range. They also prevailed in the rebounding battle, 49-42.

Richaun Holmes and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot co-led the Sixers (28-48) with matching 19-point efforts, with the former adding seven rebounds, two assists and two steals and the latter supplying four rebounds and one steal. With Robert Covington (knee) now out for the season, Justin Anderson celebrated his new permanent starter role with a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists and a block. T.J. McConnell tallied 10 points, seven assists, three rebounds and two steals. Dario Saric had a down game by his standards with eight points, four rebounds and four assists, but Shawn Long helped make for it with 16 points, four rebounds, one steal and one block off the bench.

James paced the Cavs with a game-high 34 points, which he complemented with nine rebounds and six assists. Kyrie Irving followed with 24 points, nine assists, one rebound and two steals. Kevin Love posted an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists and three steals. J.R. Smith was solid with 14 points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Channing Frye led the bench with 12 points.

The Sixers head north of the border to take on the Toronto Raptors on Sunday evening, while the Cavs remain home and await the Indiana Pacers  on Sunday evening as well.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Orlando Magic, 117-116, at TD Garden on Friday. 

Boston were expected to win this game easily, but Orlando gave them a hard-fought battle. In fact, there were 11 ties and 18 lead changes in this thriller. Despite the Celtics taking 14 less shots than the Magic, they ended up shooting 45 percent from the field, with Orlando shot just 40 percent. The Magic actually won many of the statistics, as they ended up leading in rebounding, assists, free-throw percentage, three-point percentage, points in the paint and turnovers in this defeat.

The Magic (27-49) have now lost eight of their last 11 games, as their defense continues to falter. Aaron Gordon led the way for Orlando, as he tallied 32 points, 16 rebounds and two blocks. Evan Fournier finished second on the team, totaling 20 points, two assists and two steals. Elfrid Payton fell just shy of a triple-double, collecting 12 points, nine rebounds, 15 assists and two steals. The Magic will be in action again on Saturday in a road matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. 

The Celtics (49-27) recently captured the top-spot in the east, as this close win may prove to be the difference at the end of the year. Isaiah Thomas was the player of the game, as he amassed 35 points, three rebounds and seven assists. Al Horford accumulated 12 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Jae Crowder accrued 18 points, five rebounds and two steals. On deck for Boston is a road matchup versus the New York Knicks on Sunday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Detroit Pistons in overtime, 108-105, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening. 

The Bucks (40-36) allowed the Pistons (35-42) to climb back into the game after they'd ambushed by a 35-22 margin in the first quarter. Detroit came back to outscore their hosts, 51-36, over the second and third periods, and then led by as much as 91-81 after a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope three-pointer with 5:09 remaining. However, an 8-0 run by Milwaukee over the subsequent 2:11 closed the gap to 91-89 and a Thon Maker basket with 51 seconds left tied the game at 95, eventually leading to overtime. A see-saw extra period saw the game knotted the game at 102 with as little as 1:22 remaining, but Khris Middleton's 25-foot three-point jumper at the 40-second mark began a game-clinching 6-0 run for the Bucks. 

Detroit was led by Tobias Harris, who posted 23 points, seven rebounds, three assists and one steal off the bench. Caldwell-Pope followed with 17 points, eight boards, two assists and two steals. Ish Smith and Beno Udrih contributed matching 16-point efforts from the starting five and second unit, respectively, with the former adding five assists and four rebounds and the latter providing eight assists, one rebound and two steals. Maurice Morris supplied 13 points, four boards and three assists. Jon Leuer posted nine points and 10 rebounds, while Andre Drummond compiled seven points, 13 boards, two assists, two steals and two blocks. 

Giannis Antetokunumpo spearheaded the Bucks attack with 28 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists, two blocks and one steal. Middleton was right behind him with a 25-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one assist and one steal. Maker exploded for a career-high 23 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds and one steal. Matthew Dellavedova drew the start for Malcolm Brogdon (back) and totaled six points, seven assists and three rebounds.

The Pistons are now off until next Wednesday evening, when they take on the Toronto Raptors at home. The Bucks remain home for a Sunday afternoon showdown with the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 99-90, at FedEx Forum on Friday. 

Memphis were expected to win this game easily, but Dallas made a late run to make a respectable scoreline. It was a near wire-to-wire win for the Grizzlies, as Dallas' only lead came in the first quarter, with it being a one-point lead for less than a minute. The second quarter was the difference, with Memphis winning that quarter, 34-15. Rebounding was a big factor for the Grizzlies, as they won that battle, 47-38. Dallas couldn't get anything going on offense either, shooting 38 percent from the field and 35 percent from three-point range.

The Mavericks (31-44) playoff hopes have been steadily slipping away and this loss may be the nail in the coffin. Despite shooting just 3-of-17 from the field, Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 13 points and 12 rebounds. Wesley Matthews matched those 13 points, adding three rebounds and seven assist to his tally. J.J. Barea led the bench, as he provided 13 points and five assists. 

The Grizzlies (42-34) have now followed up two wins after four-straight losses, as they appear to be out of that slump. Mike Conley was the star, as he collected 28 points, five rebounds and six assists. No other starter had more than nine points.

												The New York Knicks defeated the host Miami Heat, 98-94, at American Airlines Arena on Friday evening. 

Despite playing without Carmelo Anthony (lower back), Derrick Rose (knee), or Lance Thomas (hip), the Knicks (29-47) managed to steal one from one of the hottest teams in the league. The Heat (37-39) started out with a 33-29 first quarter and stayed with it the whole way, holding the Heat off in the final minutes, as they made a strong push. The Heat had a chance to tie it up with just 12 seconds remaining, however they were called for offensive basket interference on the play, costing them the game. 

Kristaps Porzingis led the way for the Knicks, with 22 points on 10-of-18 shooting, seven rebounds, three assists and a block, in 36 minutes. Courtney Lee followed up with 20 points, while Justin Holiday added 12 off the bench. Willy Hernangomez finished with 10 points 12 rebounds. Ron Baker also chipped in 10 points, and dished six assists, with only one turnover, as he got the start at the point. The Knicks have been eliminated from playoff contention, but this win is a good confidence booster for some of the young guys. They go on play host to the Celtics on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, the Heat shot only 41 percent from the field, including 24.2 percent from long range, as they could not find their rhythm against the feisty Knicks. Goran Dragic led the Heat with 22 points and five assists. Hassan Whiteside followed up with 17 points and 16 rebounds, while Tyler Johnson added 15 points off the bench. James Johnson shot only 3-of-10 from the field, on his way to 12 points, in 27 minutes off the bench. The Heat will have to look to their next contest on Sunday, when they play host to the Nuggets, to solidify their spot in the top eight.

Victor Oladipo chipped in 16 points, while Steven Adams added 13 points and seven rebounds. The Thunder will look to bounce back when they play host to the Hornets on Sunday.

Klay Thompson was the only other starter to score in double digits for Golden State, as he finished with 20 points, eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block, in 36 minutes. JaVale McGee was solid in 11 minutes off the bench, as he chipped in 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting. Andre Iguodala was the only other player to score in double digits for the Warriors, as he added 14 points, five rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two steals, in 28 minutes off the bench. The Warriors played solid defense, holding the Rockets to only 37.0 percent from the field. The Warriors look extend their 10-game winning streak, as they play host to the Wizards on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, six players scored in double digits for Houston, however no one topped 20 points. James Harden was the high-point man with 17, although he struggled going only 4-of-18 from the field, in 35 minutes. Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza followed up with 15 points each, while Lou WIlliams added 13 off the bench. The Rockets will look to get back on track, as they visit Phoenix to take on the Suns on Sunday.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 90-89, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Thursday evening. 

The Pistons (35-41) came into Thursday's game in desperate need of a win, and even though they drew the team with the worst record in the league, they likely knew they were in for a fight. The Nets (16-59) have given virtually any team put in front of them a difficult time, and Thursday's game proved to be no exception. Brooklyn actually carried a 39-35 lead into halftime, but Detroit was able to mount a fourth-quarter rally to secure the win. Both teams shot poorly overall, which left plenty of rebounding opportunities. The Pistons won the battle on the glass by a 53-46 margin and also managed to limit the Nets to sub-40 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively.

Sean Kilpatrick actually paced the Nets from the bench, tallying 15 points, two rebounds and one assist. Jeremy Lin provided 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and one steal. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson matched Lin's point total and added nine rebounds, one assist and one block. Brook Lopez posted 11 points, nine rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Spencer Dinwiddie was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, three boards, two assists and one block. 

Marcus Morris led the Pistons with a game-high 28 points, which he supplemented with 13 rebounds and two blocks. Ish Smith followed with 21 points, six rebounds, five assists and one block. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope provided 12 points, three boards, two assists and one steal. Andre Drummond mustered just two points but hauled in 11 rebounds and also supplied two assists, two steals and two blocks. Tobias Harris registered eight points, six rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block.

The Nets head back home to tangle with the Orlando Magic on Saturday evening, while the Pistons head to Milwaukee to tangle with the Bucks on Friday night.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 99-93 Thursday at United Center. 

It wasn't the best start for the home team, as the Bulls (36-39) struggled offensively through the first 24 minutes of Thursday's game and faced a nine-point deficit at halftime. Then, something clicked for Chicago in the third quarter, as they nearly doubled up over the next 12 minutes and outscored the Cavaliers (47-27) by 16 points and held on to that lead for the remainder of the game. Nikola Mirotic continues to be on a hot streak, as he led the team Thursday with 28 points on 9-of-14 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds. Jimmy Butler wasn't too far behind, scoring 25 points of his own to go along with six rebounds and five assists. As a team, it was the Bulls hot outside shooting that carried them through the the second half, as they shot a scorching 48 percent from behind the arc. The victory completes a regular season sweep for the Bulls over Cleveland. 

As for the Cavaliers, they have now lost three straight games and drop to 6-10 over the month of March. The problems Thursday night stemmed from their lack of production from their second unit, as while four of five starters managed to score at least 12 points, the Cavaliers only got 12 total points form their bench. LeBron James led the way with an impressive performance, finishing with a team-high 26 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in 39 minutes, while Kyrie Irving scored 20 points of his own. 

Up next, the Cavaliers will look to get back on the right track Friday against the 76ers, while the Bulls will continue their playoff push Saturday against the Hawks.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 119-104, at Target Center on Thursday. 

This game meant much more to the T'Wolves than the Lakers and they showed that in this scoreline. The middle quarters is when they took control, as they outscored Los Angeles, 59-45, in the second and third quarters. In addition, the Timberwolves held a lead of nine points or more for the final 16 minutes. The key for Minnesota was the assist-to-turnover ratio, as they recorded 10 more assists (30-20) than the Lakers, while committing six less turnover (16-10). 

The Lakers (21-56) have now lost nine of their last 11 games, as they simply can't wait for the offseason to begin. Jordan Clarkson led the way for Los Angeles, as he tallied 18 points, three rebounds and seven assists. Julius Randle collected 12 points and 13 rebounds. D'Angelo Russell shot just 4-of-14 from the field, but still accumulated 14 points, three rebounds, six assists and three steals. Tarik Black, Tyler Ennis and Thomas Robinson all scored in double figures off the bench. On deck for the Lakers is a ""road game"" against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, 

The Timberwolves (30-44) still have slim hopes for a playoff berth, as this victory kept the possibility open for the time being. Ricky Rubio was the star, as he dropped a career-high 33 points to go along with five rebounds, 10 assists and two steals on 12-of-21 from the field. Karl-Anthony Towns was equally as good, totaling 32 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two steals. Andrew Wiggins contributed 27 points, four rebounds and two assists of his own. Gorgui Dieng amassed 11 points, 15 rebounds, six assists and three blocks. Minnesota will look to build off this win on Saturday in a home matchup versus the Sacramento Kings.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers took down the Phoenix Suns on Thursday, 124-118.

LA (46-31) has now won two games in a row on both games of a back to back.  As was the case on Wednesday, the team's ""Big Three"" led them to victory on both ends.  All-Star forward Blake Griffin led the team in scoring, pouring in 31 points on the night.  Superstar Chris Paul, meanwhile, finished with a double-double, scoring 29 to go along with 10 assists.  It was another huge rebounding night for All-Star center DeAndre Jordan as well, as he pulled down a game-high 17 boards.  As a team, offense was the story for the Clips once again.  LA shot 55 percent on the night and knocked down 12 three-pointers.

Phoenix (22-54) has now lost 10 consecutive games and is one of the league's bottom three teams.  Despite this, they excelled on the offensive end against the playoff-bound Clippers on Thursday.  The Suns shot over 53 percent from the field and had 13 offensive rebounds to just seven from Los Angeles.  Shooting guard Devin Booker had a big night once again, shooting 13-of-22 from the field for 33 points.  The explosive scoring output comes just a week after he became the sixth NBA player ever to score 70 points in a single game.

On Saturday, the Clippers will host the Lakers, while the Suns will visit Portland.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers took down the Houston Rockets on Thursday, 117-107.

Portland (37-38) has been one of the league's hottest teams, and has now won eight of its last nine games.  Since acquiring big man Jusuf Nurkic, the team has seen immense success, due in large part to the play of the young center.  On Thursday, Nurkic scored 19 points to go along with 11 rebounds and blocked three shots.  The star of the show, however, was point guard Damian Lillard.  Lillard scored a team-high 31 points and recorded a double-double, dishing out 11 assists.  Portland shot over 46 percent on the night and finished with 13 three-pointers made.  

Houston (51-24) also came into the game scorching hot, but dropped the game by double figures by the end.  MVP contender James Harden was superb once again, scoring 30 points and pulling down four rebounds.  It was a season low in the assists column for the league leader in dimes, though, as he dished out only four assists on the night.  Five players scored in double figures in what was still a relatively strong offensive night for the Rockets.  The team shot over 43 percent on the night and scored 107 points.

The Rockets will visit Golden State on Friday, while Portland will host Phoenix on Saturday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the New York Knicks, 105-88, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday evening.

The Heat (37-38) continued their fight to preserve the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference against a Knicks (28-47) that was missing Derrick Rose (knee) and exploited New York's short-handedness. Miami shot 47.6 percent from the field and 48 percent from three-point range while limiting the Knicks to respective figures of 37.1 and 20 percent in those categories. New York notably won the rebound battle by a 52-40 margin but trailed in every quarter on the way to the double-digit loss. 

Miami was led by Goran Dragic, who tallied 20 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and two steals. Josh Richardson followed with 17 points, one assist, one rebound, five steals and one block. Hassan Whiteside had a near double-double with 11 points, nine boards, one assist and four blocks. James Johnson led the bench with 18 points, seven rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocks. Tyler Johnson was productive as a reserve as well with 12 points, seven rebounds and one assist.

Kristaps Porzingis paced New York with 20 points, eight boards, two assists and three blocks. Willy Herangomez provided 12 points, nine rebounds and one assist. Courtney Lee registered 10 points, two rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Carmelo Anthony had a modest game by his standards with nine points, seven boards and one assist. Chasson Randle led the bench with nine points, four rebounds and three assists.

The Heat and Knicks reconvene in Miami on Friday night for the second game of the home-and-home series.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Indiana Pacers, 110-97, at FedEx Forum on Wednesday.

The Grizzlies have been dominant at home this season and this wire-to-wire win just adds to the resume. It was as one-sided as it could be, with the Grizzlies holding a double-digit lead for the final 35 minutes. While Memphis didn't dominate any statistic, it won nearly every one. In fact, Memphis ended up winning the shooting, assisting, turnovers, steals, fastbreak points and points in the paint differentials. The Grizzlies starters really took control, as they outscored the Pacers starters, 84-53.

The Pacers (37-38) have struggled on the road all season and they never seemed to be in this game. Paul George once again led Indiana, as he tallied 22 points, three rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks. Thaddeus Young finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and three assists. Aaron Brooks led the bench with 18 points, while C.J. Miles provided 15 points, three rebounds and two assists of his own off the pine. On deck for Indiana is a road matchup versus the Toronto Raptors on Friday.

The Grizzlies (41-34) had to play this game without Marc Gasol (foot), but they still played well and pulled out a dominating victory. Mike Conley was the player of the game, as he collected 36 points, three rebounds, six assists and four steals. Vince Carter turned back the clock, as he totaled 21 points and eight rebounds on 5-of-8 shooting. James Ennis III got a rare start and totaled seven points, 10 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Zach Randolph was huge off the bench, as he provided 17 points, six rebounds and three assists. Memphis will look to keep rolling on Friday against the Dallas Mavericks.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Dallas Mavericks 121-118 Wednesday at Smoothie King Center. 

After missing the last two games with an ankle sprain, DeMarcus Cousins returned in a dominant fashion, as the tandem of he and Anthony Davis were nearly unstoppable in the Pelicans' (31-43) victory Wednesday night. Cousins scored 29 points and grabbed a game-high 16 rebounds while Davis still managed to score a game-high 30 points and grab 13 rebounds of his own. Together, the duo shot 50 percent from the field and an impressive 18-of-20 (90 percent) from the free throw line. As a team, New Orleans shot 50.6 percent from the field and a 40 percent from behind the arc, and they needed every one of those shots to fall as the Mavericks (31-43) simply wouldn't go away. 

Five different Dallas players scored in double figures in the losing effort, with Dirk Nowitzki leading the way with 23 points on 7-of-14 shooting and seven rebounds in 31 minutes. And overall, it was actually a very impressive offensive performance for the Mavericks, as the team shot 48.4 percent from the field and a scorching 52 percent from behind the arc. In the end, however, the team was just unable to overcome the 12-point lead the Pelicans took into halftime of Wednesday's contest. 

Up next, the Pelicans will remain home Friday to take on the Kings, while the Mavericks will head to Memphis on Friday to play the Grizzlies.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the San Antonio Spurs 110-98 Wednesday at AT&T Center. 

It wasn't the best start for the winning team Wednesday night. In fact, it was an awful one, as the Warriors (61-14) found themselves down 23-3 to the Spurs (57-17) before they could blink. That sort of beat down carried on throughout the remainder of the first quarter, as the Spurs held a 33-17 advantage after the first 12 minutes, and the game seemed all but over. Golden State had other plans, however, and they elected to dominate the ball game over the final 36 minutes. In the end, they outscored the home team by 28 points over the next three quarters, which ended in a seemingly effortless victory from Golden State. Steph Curry led the way scoring with 29 points on top of 11 assists, while Klay Thompson added 23 points of his own. Overall, the team simply caught fire after their slow start, finishing the game shooting 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from behind the arc.

As for San Antonio, their hot start was short-lived, as they not only had an eight-game winning streak come to an end, but they also failed to complete the season sweep of the Warriors. The Spurs have tended to go as their superstar wing Kawhi Leonard goes, and Wednesday night, the swingman struggled. Leonard finished with just 19 points on 7-of-20 shooting from the field and 0-of-5 shooting from downtown. Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green and Paul Gasol managed to combine for 70 points in the loss, with no other Spur able to score more than eight points. This included the zero points Tony Parker was able to score in 21 minutes on the floor. 

Following the victory, the Warriors once again have a comfortable lead as the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference standings, sitting 3.5 games ahead of the second-place Spurs and extending their winning streak to nine games.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers took down the Washington Wizards on Wednesday, 133-124.

LA (45-31) held a comfortable lead for the majority of the second half thanks to strong offensive play.  Four Clippers scored at least 23 points each, with shooting guard J.J. Redick posting a team-high 31 points.  LA's ""big three"" of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan, meanwhile, all posted impressive stat lines.  Paul had 27 points to go along with 13 assists, while Jordan had 23 points and a whopping 18 rebounds.  Griffin narrowly missed a triple-double, finishing with 26 points, nine assists, and 10 rebounds.  As a team, the Clippers saw over 56 percent shooting and knocked down 12 three-pointers.  

The Wizards (46-29) remain in third place in the East thanks to a Toronto loss earlier in the night.  The Wiz were unable to replicate their astounding comeback from Tuesday night, in which they overcame a double-digit fourth-quarter deficit against the Lakers.  Despite the loss, superstar point guard John Wall led the team with an impressive 41 points while also notching seven rebounds and eight assists.  It was a good night for Washington on offense as well, as they shot over 49 percent from the field while draining 13 three-pointers.  However, they could not defend the astounding offensive output that LA put forward.

												The visiting Utah Jazz steamrolled the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, 112-82.

Utah (46-29) had no trouble getting a win on Wednesday, easily blowing out the Kings.  Star center Rudy Gobert helped the team establish dominance inside, posting 16 points and a team-high 15 rebounds.  As a team, it was a dominant offensive night, as the Jazz shot over 53 percent from the field while knocking down 13 three-pointers.  Utah also held a steady advantage on the boards, out-rebounding the Kings 43-32.  The win was integral in the Jazz's playoff push, as they maintain a lead over the Clippers for fourth place in the Western Conference.

Sacramento (29-46) had won two in a row coming into Wednesday's matchup but was stopped flat in its tracks by the Jazz.  Points did not come easily for the Kings, as they shot just 45 percent and made only two three-pointers on the night.  Only three players scored in double figures for Sacramento, and only one player scored more than 12.   Shooting guard Ben McLemore led the team with 22 points on 9-of-12 shooting.  He added four rebounds.  

Utah will host the Wizards on Friday, while the Kings will visit the Pelicans.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 118-108, at Spectrum Center on Tuesday evening.

The Bucks (38-36) checked into Tuesday's contest with only a 16-19 road record but determined to keep their fifth seeding in the Eastern Conference away from the Atlanta Hawks and Indiana Pacers, which lingered only a half-game behind coming into the night's action. Milwaukee got off to a fast start with a 35-point first quarter added another 37 in the second period to build a 72-50 halftime lead. Their stellar 62.2 percent shooting helped them stave off a second-half comeback from the Hornets (33-41), which outscored them by a 58-46 margin over the third and fourth quarters. The rebounding battle was also key, as Milwaukee hauled in 42 boards to Charlotte's 31. 

Tony Snell led the Bucks on the night with 26 points, three rebounds and one assist. Giannis Antetokounmpo provided 20 points, eight boards, two assists and a block. Malcolm Brogdon posted a 14-point, 10-assist double-double that also included three rebounds and a steal. Khris Middleton matched Brogdon's scoring total and added five rebounds and an assist. Greg Monroe led the second unit with 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists. 

Kemba Walker's 26 points led the Hornets, a total he supplemented with five assists and three rebounds. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist managed 12 points, six rebounds, an assist and a steal. Cody Zeller supplied eight points, one rebound and two steals. Frank Kaminsky III led the bench with 20 points, four rebounds and three assists and Jeremy Lamb was productive as a reserve as well with 16 points, three rebounds, two assists and one steal.

The Bucks now travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday night, while the Hornets head north of the border to take on Toronto on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the host Indiana Pacers, 115-114, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Tuesday.

This game meant a lot more to the Pacers than the Timberwolves, but Minnesota played spoiler at the buzzer. In fact, Ricky Rubio hit three free-throws with two seconds left to turn a two-point deficit into a one-point lead and eventually the win. It was close throughout, as there were six ties and 10 lead changes in total, with neither team grabbing a double-digit lead. The only true advantage Minnesota had was in three-point shooting, as they went 9-of-21 from long distance, while Indiana went 5-of-18. 

The Timberwolves (29-44) playoff hopes have been slipping away over recent weeks, but this victory keeps it alive just a bit. Karl-Anthony Towns was the player of the game, as he collected 37 points and 12 rebounds. Rubio finished second on the team, accumulating 21 points, five rebounds and 10 assists. Gorgui Dieng amassed 19 points, six rebounds and two blocks. Andrew Wiggins was the last Minnesota player in double figures, as he totaled 17 points, five rebounds and two assists. 

The Pacers (37-37) have been dominant at home all season, but this was a devastating loss in a game they were supposed to win. Paul George did all he could for Indiana, as he led the team with 37 points, seven rebounds and four steals. Jeff Teague accrued 20 points, three rebounds and 10 assists. Monta Ellis got a rare start and provided 19 points, four rebounds, five assists and two steals. Myles Turner contributed 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two blocks.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 106-101, at Barclays Center on Tuesday evening. 

The Sixers (28-46) continue to push for as many victories as possible after such a considerable degree of futility over the last several seasons, and their fighting spirit helped them prevail against an equally feisty Nets (16-58) squad on Tuesday. Philadelphia had forged a razor-thin 58-57 lead by halftime but had to fight until the closing seconds to pull out the win. Neither team shot particularly well but it was two 20-point-plus efforts by Robert Covington and Dario Saric that led the way for the Sixers and spearheaded their 11th road win of the season.

Saric paced Philadelphia with 23 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, an assist and a block. Covington produced a 21-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist, two steals and two blocks. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot produced a near double-double with 17 points, nine boards, three assists, a steal and a block. Richaun Holmes generated 13 points, five boards and two assists. T.J. McConnell supplied a full stat line of eight points, 10 assists, two rebounds, three steals and a block. Nik Stauskas led the bench with 11 points, four rebounds, two assists and a block. 

Brook Lopez led Brooklyn with 26 points, nine rebounds, six assists and two blocks. Jeremy Lin filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, seven assists, six rebounds and four steals. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson matched Lin's point total and added seven rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks.  Caris LaVert turned in nine points and five rebounds, while Spencer Dinwiddie led the bench with 10 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. 

The Sixers head back home to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday evening, while the Nets head to Motown to do battle with the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Phoenix Suns, 95-91, at Philips Arena on Tuesday. 

Atlanta were expected to win this game easily, but Phoenix gave them a run for their money. While there were only two ties and two lead changes, neither team led by more than nine points for the entirety of the second half. Phoenix were stifled by Atlanta's defense, as they shot 37 percent from the field, 23 percent from three-point range and 58 percent from the free-throw line. The Hawks took care of the defensive rebounding too, winning that battle, 42-34.

The Suns (22-53) had to play this game without Devin Booker and Eric Bledsoe, as they didn't have enough in the arsenal to pull out the upset win. T.J. Warren led the way for Phoenix, as he tallied 24 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Tyler Ulis finished second on the team, accruing 15 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. Alex Len totaled 12 points, seven rebounds and three steals. Jared Dudley played well off the bench, providing six points, eight rebounds and seven assists. On deck for Phoenix is a home matchup versus the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday. 

The Hawks (38-36) had lost seven-straight headed into this game, so to say this win was needed would be a drastic understatement. Dennis Schroder was the player of the game, as he collected 27 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Ersan Ilyasova finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Detroit Pistons 97-96 Tuesday at the Palace in Auburn Hills. 

With 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter of Tuesday's game, the Heat (36-38) found themselves down by four points after having blown a double-digit lead. After that, madness occurred, as a Stanley Johnson technical foul, a Goran Dragic jumper and a jump ball that ended up in Miami's hands over the next 20 seconds gave the visiting team the ball with a chance to win. After a James Johnson missed jumper and a missed put-back from Dragic, Hassan Whiteside came to the Heat's rescue with a gentle tip-in as the buzzer sounded. With that tip, the Heat greatly improved their chances of making the playoffs, while the Pistons chances worsened. 

Dragic led the way for Miami with a game-high 28 points to go along with four rebounds and four assists in 34 minutes, while Whiteside's streak of 15 straight games with a double-double came to an end Tuesday, but just barely, as the big man finished with 17 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes. Off the bench, James Johnson produced in a big way, making important plays down the stretch and recording 16 points and six rebounds in 33 minutes as a reserve. Most importantly, the Heat maintained their spot as the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference. 

As for the Pistons (34-41), their collapse results in them now being 2.5 games behind Miami for the last playoff spot, as they have now lost five games in a row. They were led Tuesday night by the heroics of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who led the team back after falling behind by double figures and finished with a team-high 25 points in 37 minutes. Ish Smith also came up big as the team's starting point guard, scoring 16 points and dishing out six assists. Tobias Harris, in a return to a role off the bench, scored 19 points and grabbed six rebounds in 30 minutes.

Up next, the Pistons will look to end their losing streak at home against Brooklyn on Thursday, while the Heat will head to New York on Wednesday to take on the Knicks.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets 113-106 Tuesday at Toyota Center. 

The Warriors (60-14) managed to get off to a hot start Tuesday, as they had already opened up a 17-point lead by the time the first quarter was over. It wasn't as easy for them the rest of the way, however, as the Rockets (51-23) came back strong over the next 12 minutes and managed to cut the lead to eight as the teams headed into the locker room. Unfortunately for Houston, they failed to get it much closer than that, as Golden State's starting backcourt of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson wouldn't let the Rockets fully back into the contest. Curry finished with a game-high 32 points in 33 minutes to go along with 10 rebounds and seven assists, while Thompson finished with 25 points in 37 minutes. Both shot an efficient 50 percent from the field, and that aligned with the team's overall performance, as the Warriors shot 51 percent from the field as a unit. 

As for the Rockets, they did not have the same success from the field, as the team shot just 38.8 percent overall and a very poor 16.1 percent from behind the arc. All-Star guard James Harden did, however, record his 20th triple-double of the season with a team-high 24 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds in 38 minutes, but he shot a poor 5-of-20 from the field and 1-of-9 from behind the arc. In all, six Houston players, including all six starters, managed to score in double figures, but the rate they were able to do so at was ultimately too inefficient to take down the league-best Warriors. 

Up next, the Warriors will look to extend their win streak to nine Wednesday in San Antonio, while the Rockets will travel to Portland on Thursday to take on the Trail Blazers.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the rivial Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, 122-113.

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular, as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J. McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland (36-38).  Nurkic contributed a career-high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks.  The output came against his former team, from whom he was traded at the deadline.  Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field, shooting 12-of-15 from the field and 9-of-11 at the free-throw line.  McCollum, meanwhile, shot 15-of-24 for a game-high 39 points.  The two were the centers of a red-hot Blazers offense, as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night.  

Denver (35-39), meanwhile, saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers. Six Nuggets scored in double figures, and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple-double.  Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up, recording 17 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists.  However, the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland.  Foul trouble proved problematic as well, as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free-throws to Portland.  The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings, as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win.  

Portland will host Houston on Wednesday, while Denver will visit Charlotte on Thursday.

												The visiting Washington Wizards took down the Los Angeles Lakers in a comeback win on Tuesday, 119-108.

Washington (46-28) won its fourth straight game despite entering the fourth quarter with a double-digit deficit.  The Wizards came back quickly, thanks in large part to strong play from star point guard John Wall.  Wall continued his dominant season with 34 points, 14 assists, and four steals.  Largely due to his offense, the Wizards were able to shoot over 51 percent from the field and scored 37 fourth-quarter points.  The fourth quarter seemed to be the Wizards' territory on Tuesday, as they outscored LA 37-13 for the stunning comeback victory.  Thanks to the win, Washington remains seated in third place in the Eastern Conference.  

Los Angeles (21-53) nearly pulled off a major upset but may be better off without it as they eye the upcoming draft lottery.  The team simply fell apart late in the game, as their youthful lack of NBA experience began to show against one of the league's top teams.  The star of the night for LA was sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell, who has had even more opportunity to flourish since the Lakers parted ways with sixth man Lou Williams at the trade deadline.  Russell had a big night and showed the skill that made him the draft's second pick, scoring 28 points and dishing out a team-high nine assists.  

The Wizards will stay in LA and play the Clippers on Wednesday, while the Lakers will visit Minnesota on Thursday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Orlando Magic, 131-112, at Air Canada Centre on Monday evening. 

The Raptors (45-29) have managed to remain in serious contention despite the ongoing absence of Kyle Lowry (wrist), and DeMar DeRozan has unsurprisingly been a major reason why. The All-Star guard had rattled off a pair of 40-point efforts recently and was in a potentially advantageous position for more of the same Monday, as the Magic (27-47) had been particularly vulnerable to shooting guards. DeRozan had also excelled in previous games against Orlando this season and the pattern held true once more, as he scored a game-high 36 points and added three assists and two rebounds. Toronto saw five other players score in double digits as well and tallied stellar success rates of 59 percent from the field and 66.7 percent from three-point range. They also dominated down low, winning the rebounding battle by a 43-33 margin.

Orlando did see all five members of the first unit post double digits in the scoring column, beginning with Elfrid Payton, who managed a near double-double with 22 points, nine assists, one rebound, one steal and one block. Evan Fournier was next with 20 points, one rebound, one assist and two steals. Terrence Ross was solid in his return to Toronto, supplying 17 points, two boards and four steals. Aaron Gordon provided 16 points, one rebound and two steals. Nikola Vucevic posted a 12-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included four assists. D.J. Augustin led the bench with eight points.

Jonas Valanciunas followed DeRozan with 17 points, nine boards and one block. Serge Ibaka totaled 16 points, seven rebounds, one assist and one steal. Cory Joseph submitted a 15-point, 13-assist double-double that also included six rebounds and a block. Norman Powell led the bench with 16 points, two assists, one rebound and one block while Jakob Poetl turned in 12 points and four rebounds on the second unit as well.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Detroit Pistons, 109-95, at Madison Square Garden on Monday. 

New York haven't had many dominating wins this season, but this was definitely one of them. In fact, the Knicks led for the entirety of the second half, while holding a double-digit lead for 23 of the final 24 minutes. Defense was key for New York, as they forced Detroit to shoot 43 percent from the field, while recording 13 steals. The Knicks ended up shooting 54 percent from the field, while outassisting the Pistons, 26-18. They did that damage while committing just 12 turnovers, with Detroit committing 18 on their end.

The Pistons (34-40) have now lost seven of their last eight games, as their playoff hopes are swiftly floating away. Marcus Morris led the way for Detroit, as he tallied 20 points, one rebound and two assists. Andre Drummond was their best player, as he totaled 10 points, 15 rebounds and three assists in just 24 minutes of action. Ish Smith started and accumulated 15 points, six rebounds and five assists. On deck for Detroit is a home matchup versus the Miami Heat on Tuesday. 

The Knicks (28-47) snapped a five-game losing streak with this win, as they look for some momentum headed into the offseason. Derrick Rose scored a game-high 27 points, also adding four rebounds and six assists to his tally on 12-of-17 shooting. Kristaps Porzingis finished second on the team, collecting 25 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and three block. Carmelo Anthony totaled 21 points, three rebounds, five assists and three steals. Wily Hernangomez was the only other Knick in double figures, as he accrued 15 points and five rebounds. Those four starters combined to go 36-of-57 from the field. New York's next game is on Wednesday against the Miami Heat.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 103-74 Monday at AT&T Center. 

Monday night's outing served as a statement game for the Spurs (57-16) and the worst offensive performance of the season for the visiting Cavaliers (47-26), with 74 points being their season-low total of the year. It was essentially a wire-to-wire victory for the Spurs, as they opened up a 10-point lead after the first quarter and never looked back. Kawhi Leonard once again shined for San Antonio, scoring 25 points to go along with six rebounds, six assists and three steals, but it was the team's bench that did most of the damage Monday night. All eight San Antonio reserves scored in the outing, and the bench as a whole managed to accumulate 49 total points. 

As for the Cavaliers, their struggles in the month of March continue, as they have now lost two in a row and three of their last four games, and they've lost those three games by a combined 54 points. The 74 points scored is a season-low for Cleveland, and they had a brutal shooting performance to go along with it, as they shot just 37.3 percent from the field and 15.4 percent from behind the arc. Only two Cavaliers players, LeBron James and Tristan Thompson, managed to score in double figures, as it was a night to forget for star point guard Kyrie Irving. The All-Star shot just 4-of-13 from the field and scored just eight points in 26 minutes. 

Up next, the Spurs will look to extend their win streak to six games at home against the Warriors on Wednesday, while the Cavaliers will look to end their skid Thursday against the Bulls.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Dallas Mavericks 92-91 Monday at American Airlines Center. 

With just over three minutes remaining in Monday's contest, the Thunder (42-31) looked dead in the water, as they were down 13 and the Mavericks (31-42) had control for majority of the game. Russell Westbrook, however, had other plans, as he led the team on a 14-0 run to end the game that was topped off by a game-winning jumper from the free throw line. Westbrook finished with yet another triple-double of 37 points (16 of which came in the final quarter), 13 rebounds and 10 assists in 36 minutes, and he did so while shooting an efficient 15-of-30 from the field. And the MVP-candidate carried the load for Oklahoma City, as Victor Oladipo (15) and Taj Gibson (13) were the only other players to score in double figures for the Thunder. 

As for Dallas, they played a strong 45 minutes before collapsing down the stretch and missing their final six shots from the field. Six different Mavericks players managed to score in double figures, but overall, it ended up being a subpar offensive performance from the team, as they shot just 41.3 percent from the field. It was, however, one of the better performances from Nerlens Noel since he was traded to Dallas, as he recorded 15 points on 6-of-12 shooting and eight rebounds -- both of which were team-highs -- in 28 minutes. 

Up next, the Thunder will head to Orlando on Wednesday to take on the Magic, while the Mavericks will look to avoid dropping their third straight game in New Orleans on Wednesday.

												The host Sacramento Kings narrowly defeated the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday, 91-90, thanks to clutch free-throws from point guard Darren Collison.

Collison led the Kings (29-45) to their second straight win, posting team highs of 23 points and seven assists.  Sacramento struggled mightily on the glass all game, allowing the Grizzlies a nine-rebound advantage and 19 offensive boards.  Fortunately, shots just weren't falling for Memphis, as the Grizz were held to just 34 percent shooting from the field.  The Kings, meanwhile, enjoyed fairly stellar offensive output.  The team shot over 46 percent from the field and saw five players score in double figures.  Three-point shooting was a problem, though, as the team hit just 25 percent of its shots from beyond the arc.

Memphis (40-34) has hit a cold stretch in the season at an inopportune time, as the Western Conference playoff race continues to heat up.  The team has now lost four straight games and looked lost on the offensive end on Monday.  The Grizzlies were able to stay in the game and remain competitive despite stagnant offense.  While point guard Mike Conley poured in 22 points, it was still an off night for Memphis in terms of scoring.  What was particularly problematic was the team's shooting from long range, as they hit just 19 percent of their attempts from three-point range.  Ball movement was another issue, with only 15 field goals coming off assists for Memphis.  

The Grizzlies will host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, while the Kings will see the Utah Jazz.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 108-100, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday. 

The Jazz (45-29) improved upon their slight lead over the Clippers for the fourth seed in the Western Conference with a win over the shorthanded Pelicans, as DeMarcus Cousins (ankle) was sidelined for a second straight game. Anthony Davis did nearly everything for New Orleans, but it was not enough to combat the well-rounded Jazz who shared the ball and saw four of their five starters score at least 17 points. Utah took a 10 point lead into the fourth quarter, but New Orleans was unable to match the efficiency from the Jazz, especially behind the arc where they finished a lights out 55.6 percent. 

Utah was led by Rudy Gobert, Rodney Hood and George Hill. Gobert finished with 20 points, 19 rebounds and five blocks, while Hood buried 4-of-7 from three point land and scored 20 points as well. George Hill added 17 points, five assists and two rebounds across 33 minutes of action. Joe Johnson was the most effective off the bench for the Jazz and added 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting, to go with six assists and seven rebounds. 

Davis had the most impressive performance of the game, though his team fell short. The big man scored 36 points, grabbed 17 rebounds and added three assists, three steals and three blocks. Jrue Holiday contributed 19 points, five assists and two steals in 38 minutes, while Jordan Crawford pitched in 12 points off the bench.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 120-106, at Spectrum Center on Sunday afternoon. 

The Hornets (33-40) came into Sunday's game with a golden opportunity to keep their faint playoff hopes alive, as the Suns (22-52), despite plenty of offensive prowess, had been a complete sieve on defense. Charlotte exploited the opportunity to its fullest potential, with six players hitting double digits in the scoring column. The Hornets also shot 48.3 percent from the field and 46.7 percent from three-point range and essentially put their stamp on the game in the first quarter, when they jumped out to a 38-18 lead.

Devin Booker couldn't come anywhere close to his 70-point effort from Friday night, but his 23 points did lead the Suns on the afternoon. He supplemented that total with five assists, four rebounds and one block. T.J. Warren followed with a 21-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and four steals. Tyler Ulis provided 16 points, nine assists, four rebounds and one steal. Marquese Chriss tallied 13 points, three boards and one assist. Jared Dudley led the bench with 12 points, five assists and two rebounds. Alan Williams supplied an 11-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists, a steal and a block.

Kemba Walker led the way for Charlotte with 31 points, which he supplemented with nine assists, four rebounds and one block. Marvin Williams managed 21 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal. Nicolas Batum pitched in with 18 points, 10 assists, six rebounds and one steal. Cody Zeller totaled 16 points, seven boards, two assists and four steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist rounded out the starting five's productive afternoon with 14 points, five rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Frank Kaminsky III paced the bench with 10 points, seven boards and two assists.

The Suns next head to Altanta where they'll tangle with the Hawks on Tuesday evening while the Hornets remain home to face the Milwaukee Bucks on that same night.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the host Atlanta Hawks, 107-92, at Philips Arena on Sunday.

Atlanta were expected to win this game easily, but when you're struggling, nothing is given. Brooklyn's defense really ratcheted up the intensity, holding the Hawks to 35 percent shooting from the field and 19 percent shooting from three-point range. In addition, Brooklyn recorded 13 steals and seven blocks, while forcing 20 turnovers from the Hawks. It was a dominating performance, with the Nets leading for the final three quarters, while holding a double-digit lead for over half of the game. Bench production was a huge factor as well, with Brooklyn winning that battle, 46-5.

The Nets (16-57) have now won three of their last four games, as that marks one of their best stretches of the season. Brook Lopez led the way, as he tallied 23 points and seven rebounds. Jeremy Lin wasn't far behind, accruing 19 points, four rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson recorded a double-double, totaling 11 points and 13 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie was a nice spark off the bench, providing 10 points, two rebounds, four assists and two steals. Brooklyn will look to keep rolling on Tuesday against the Philadelphia 76ers. 

The Hawks (37-36) have now lost seven-straight games, as this is one of the worst defeats of the year, Dennis Schroder did all he could for Atlanta, as he led the team with 24 points, three rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Dwight Howard amassed 19 points and 16 rebounds. Taurean Prince started for Paul Millsap (knee) and accumulated 17 points, six rebounds and three steals. Ersan Ilyasova went just 3-of-14 from the field, but still contributed nine points and 18 rebounds. Tim Hardaway Jr. finished with 16 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. The Hawks will look to get out of this slide on Tuesday in a home matchup versus the struggling Phoenix Suns.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 98-97, at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Kings (28-45) played like the team with playoff seeding at stake in the fourth quarter after entering the period trailing 76-65 and then falling behind by as much as 89-71 with 7:58 remaining. The Clippers (44-31), perhaps feeling the lingering effects of playing five games over the course of the last week, couldn't score between the 5:16 and 3:03 marks of the fourth period and ultimately saw Sacramento outscore them by a 33-21 tally in the final 12 minutes. Willie Cauley-Stein's basket after an offensive rebound with three seconds remaining gave the Kings the 98-97 lead that would prove to be the final margin of victory, and Chris Paul missed a would-be game-winning 21-foot jumper at the buzzer to seal the upset win.

Darren Collison led the way for the visitors with 19 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. Buddy Hield continued his strong play with 15 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal. Anthony Tolliver matched Hield's scoring total while leading the bench and added three rebounds and a block. Georgios Papagiannis provided 12 points, four rebounds, four assists and two blocks in a reserve role as well. Cauley-Stein mustered a modest eight points overall but also hauled in 14 rebounds, dished out an assist and recorded a pair of steals and a block. Tyreke Evans also tallied eight points and complemented them with four boards and one assist. Ben McLemore was productive off the bench as well with eight points, two rebounds and two assists.

DeAndre Jordan led the way for the Clippers with 20 points, 11 rebounds, one steal and one block. Paul poured in 17 points and added nine assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. Blake Griffin matched Paul in the scoring department and also posted six rebounds, four assists and a steal.  Austin Rivers drew the start at shooting guard and registered 10 points, nine boards and four assists. Jamal Crawford led the second unit with nine points, two assists and a rebound.

The Kings head back home to tangle with the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night, while the Clippers remain home and await the Washington Wizards on Wednesday evening.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 109-94, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Sunday. 

Milwaukee was expected to win this game easily, but Chicago rode a huge third quarter en route to an upset win. In fact, the Bulls outscored the Bucks, 35-24 in the third quarter and held the lead for the final 20 minutes. Rebounding was a huge factor, with the Bulls winning that battle, 49-34. Chicago also dominated the shooting, as they hit 54 percent from the field and 48 percent from three, while the Bucks shot just 44 percent from the field and 30 percent from long range. The 33 assists recorded from Chicago obliterated the 20 assists the Bucks handed out as well.

The Bulls (35-39) had just three wins in their previous 12 games, so this road victory may be what they need to get back to .500. Jimmy Butler was the player of the game, as he accumulated 20 points, six rebounds, 14 assists and three steals. Nikola Mirotic led Chicago in scoring, as he dropped 28 points and eight rebounds on 11-of-14 shooting. Robin Lopez went 9-of-13 from the field to total 18 points and five rebounds. Rajon Rondo collected 18 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, falling just shy of a triple-double. 

The Bucks (37-36) came into this game extremely hot, but this was a baffling loss against a struggling Bulls team. Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 22 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Greg Monroe finished second on the team, providing 16 points and four rebounds off the bench. Khris Middleton totaled 14 points, six rebounds and four steals, while Malcolm Brogdon finished with 14 points, four rebounds and four assists.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 137-125, at Toyota Center on Sunday. 

In a battle between two potent offenses, scoring came at ease. It was a wire-to-wire win for Houston, as they held a double-digit lead for the majority of the second half. The Rockets offense was unstoppable, shooting 63 percent from the field (50-of-79) and 51 percent from three-point range (20-of-39).

The Thunder (41-31) had a few days off before this matchup, but they simply weren't prepared for this Rockets attack. Russell Westbrook was though, as he collected 39 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists en route to his 36th triple-double of the season. Enes Kanter finished second on the team, dropping 23 points, four rebounds and two assists off the bench. Victor Oladipo finished with 15 points, four rebounds and four assists. On deck for Oklahoma City is a road matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. 

The Rockets (51-22) have now won four-straight, as the offense continues to set records. Lou Williams was the star of this one, as he provided 31 points, three rebounds and four assists on 11-of-15 shooting off Houston's bench. James Harden accrued 22 points, five rebounds and 12 assists. Trevor Ariza accumulated 24 points, six rebounds, six assists and three steals on 9-of-11 shooting. Eric Gordon started for Ryan Anderson (ankle) and contributed 24 points and two rebounds. Nene Hilario was a nice spark off the bench, amassing 17 points, four rebounds and three assists. The Rockets next game will be on Monday, when they host the Golden State Warriors.

												The host Indiana Pacers handily defeated the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday, 107-94.  

Indiana (37-36) has been one of the most consistently average teams in the league, hovering around .500 since late January.  There was nothing average about their performance on Sunday, though, as they took down the visiting Sixers with ease.  Defense was the key to victory, as they held Philly to under 40 percent shooting on the night while also forcing 14 turnovers.  Sophomore big man Myles Turner was the leader on that end of the floor, blocking two shots and adding a steal in addition to a massive 17-point, 16-rebound double-double.  The promising young big shot an impressive 7-of-9 from the field.  Star forward Paul George, meanwhile, led the team with 21 points.  

Philadelphia (27-46) remains near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings despite relative improvements of late.  On Sunday, despite pouring in 14 three-pointers, the Sixers struggled on the offensive end.  Philly shot only 39 percent from the field and saw no single player score above 16 points.  It was a particularly off night for Rookie of the Year front-runner Dario Saric, who shot just 3-of-15 from the field on the night en route to only nine points.  Despite this, Saric came away with 10 rebounds.  

Indiana will host the Timberwolves on Tuesday, while the Sixers will visit Brooklyn.

												The host Boston Celtics hung on to beat the Miami Heat on Sunday, 112-108.

Boston (48-26) is now in a tie with the Cavaliers for the first seed in the Eastern Conference.  Sunday's game marked a huge win for the Celtics, as the team not only earned its fourth straight victory, but moved into first place for the first time all season.  Strong ball movement and shooting helped propel the Celtics to victory, as Miami was characteristically tenacious on the glass.  The Cs shot over 53 percent from the field and dished out 32 team assists.  Two Boston starters, star point guard Isaiah Thomas and forward Jae Crowder, led the team's offensive charge.  Thomas, the league's second-leading scorer, dropped 30 points on the night.  Crowder, meanwhile, had a season-high 25 points including three huge three-pointers.  Crowder was also immensely impactful on the defensive end, coming away with two blocks and two steals.  

Miami (35-38), meanwhile, has been surging lately, pushing their way to the playoff picture after a dismal 13-30 start to the season.  On Sunday, the Heat showed the intensity that led them to their playoff push, out-rebounding the Celtics by seven and coming away with 16 forced turnovers.  Center Hassan Whiteside was at the heart of the win, scoring 19 points to go along with 15 rebounds.  The Heat also enjoyed bench production in droves, with sixth man Tyler Johnson coming away with a team-high 24 points off the bench.  

Boston will host the Bucks on Wednesday, while the Heat will visit Detroit on Tuesday.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday, 106-94.  

It was yet another great night for the league-best Warriors (59-14), who are now one win away from their third straight 60-win season.  With former MVP Kevin Durant still out with a knee injury, veteran forward Andre Iguodala stepped up for 20 points, seven rebounds, and four assists.  Golden State advanced to 16-0 when Iguodala scores 20 or more points.  Klay Thompson, meanwhile, led the team with 31 points on 12-of-18 shooting and 7-of-11 from three-point range.  It was a typically dominant night for the historic Warriors offense.  The team shot over 54 percent from the field, hit 17 three-pointers, and dished out 30 team assists.

The Grizzlies (40-33) have now droppped three straight games and look poised to finish in seventh place in the Western Conference.  The team shot 44 percent from the field and just 27 percent from three-point range.  Overall, it wasn't a great night for Memphis on the offensive end.  The Grizz saw only three players score in double digits and only one player score above 13 points.  That player was point guard Mike Conley, who had a stellar 29 points on 9-of-15 shooting.

The Grizzlies will visit Sacramento on Monday, while the Warriors will see Houston on Tuesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Denver Nuggets 115-90 at Pepsi Center on Sunday. 

The Pelicans (31-42) defensive effort stepped up in the second and third quarter, where the Nuggets (35-38) were unable to find a rhythm and were held to under 20 points in each of the middle periods. Anthony Davis was a monster on the boards, and led all scorers with 31 points in the contest, while rising star Nikola Jokic logged only 18 minutes and put forth a weak scoring effort. DeMarcus Cousins (ankle) was sidelined for the game. Impressively, the Pelicans bench also stepped up, as Jordan Crawford, E'Twaun Moore and Alexis Ajinca all put forth strong performances down the stretch. 

Davis finished with 31 points, 15 rebounds, three assists and one block on 12-of-17 shooting. Jrue Holiday added 13 points, six rebounds and seven assists and buried 3-of-6 shots from behind the arc. The aforementioned bench performances from Crawford and Moore totaled 25 points and nine assists combined. 

The loss puts the Portland Trail Blazers in sight of the 8-seed for the playoffs, and the Nuggets cannot afford losses down the stretch if they want to sneak into the final playoff spot. Jokic finished with eight points, 13 rebounds and two assists on 4-of-14 shooting across 18 minutes. Mason Plumlee had the hot hand off the bench where he scored 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting, while Denver shot just 37.9 percent from the field in the loss. 

Next up, the Pelicans visit the Jazz for the second game of a back-to-back on Monday, while the Nuggets visit the Trail Blazers for a heated playoff worth matchup on Tuesday.

The Trail Blazers (35-38) picked up a third win in a row and are heating up at the right time, given the Nuggets loss earlier Sunday, they are now tied for the eighth seed in the Western Conference. In addition, they host the Nuggets on Tuesday in an important game in the battle for the final playoff spot out West. Depth made the difference for Portland, as their bench ran seven players deep, while the Lakers (21-52) totaled nine players in rotation. Brandon Ingram (knee) was sidelined in the contest. 

Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum were not spectacular, but did enough on the offensive end to keep the Blazers ahead, while the Lakers 39.3 percent shooting effort was far from enough to match that of Portland. Lillard finished with 22 points, five assists, seven rebounds and three steals and McCollum added 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Allen Crabbe totaled 28 minutes off the bench and pitched in 18 points and six boards, while Al-Farouq Aminu fell one points shy of a double-double and went for nine points and 10 rebounds across 26 minutes of action. 

D'Angelo Russell matched Lillard's 22 points. Jordan Clarkson did not find a rhythm at any point and finished with just 10 points on 4-of-16 shooting, while Tyler Ennis led the bench with 14 points, five assists and three rebounds. 

Next up, the Blazers host the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Lakers play the same night and host the Washington Wizards.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the visiting Utah Jazz, 108-95, at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon. 

The Clippers (44-30) jumped out of the gates with a 28-14 first quarter, but let off the gas in the second and third quarters, allowing the Jazz (44-29) to bring it to a two-point game, with the score 72-70, heading into the fourth. However, the Clippers pulled away in the fourth, behind Jamal Crawford, who poured in 17 of his season-high 28 points in the quarter. The Clippers out-scored the Jazz 36-25 in the final frame to earn the win and clinch their sixth straight postseason berth. This was a huge win for the Clippers, as it brings them within 0.5 games of the Jazz, who hold on to fourth in the West.

Jamal Crawford led the way for Los Angeles, with 28 points on 8-of-12 shooting, including 3-of-6 from long range, in 25 minutes off the bench. Blake Griffin finished with 15 points, six rebounds, three steals and an assist, while DeAndre Jordan hauled in 15 rebounds, to go along with seven points, in 26 minutes. Marreese Speights came up big off the bench for the Clippers, as he double-doubled with 11 points and 10 rebounds, in 22 minutes. The Clippers will look to build on this victory, as they face the second night of a back-to-back, when they play host to the Kings on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, Rudy Gobert was doing it all for the Jazz, as he led the way in scoring with 26 points on 10-of-13 shooting, and rebounding, with 14 rebounds, in 36 minutes. Joe Johnson followed up with 17 points, in 26 minutes off the bench, while Gordon Hayward chipped in 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Hayward left the game mid way through the fourth with knee soreness and did not return. The Jazz will look to bounce back, as they play host to the Pelicans on Monday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 127-115, at Quicken Loans Arena on Saturday. 

Washington had one of their best performances of the season here, as they pulled out a near wire-to-wire win over the champs. In fact, they held the lead for the final 44 minutes, as Cleveland never led by more than two points. The Wizards offense was unstoppable, as they shot 60 percent from the field. They also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle, 40-32. Washington also took advantage of transition baskets, winning the fastbreak differential, 27-4.

The Wizards (45-28) have now won three-straight games, as they continue to show how dangerous they can be. John Wall was the player of the game, as he collected 37 points, four rebounds, 11 assists and two steals on 14-of-21 shooting. Bradley Beal wasn't far behind, totaling 27 points, four rebounds and six assists. Otto Porter was great on defense, accruing 10 points, six rebounds, three steals and two blocks. Kelly Oubre Jr. led the bench with 16 points and seven rebounds. On deck for the Wizards is a road matchup versus the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.

The Cavaliers (47-25) have really struggled on defense this season and that was as evident as ever in this tough loss. LeBron James led the way for Cleveland, as he tallied 24 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. Kyrie Irving finished with 23 points, two rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Kevin Love was the only other starter in double figures, as he amassed 17 points and seven rebounds. Kyle Korver and Richard Jefferson co-led the bench with 10 points a piece. Things done get any easier for the Cavs, as they play the San Antonio Spurs on the road for their next game on Monday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 94-86, at American Airlines Center on Saturday night.

The Raptors (44-29) checked into Saturday's contest having won four straight games and within striking distance of the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers. Meanwhile, the Mavs (31-41) were in urgent need of a win to keep their fading playoff hopes alive, but it was ultimately the road team that prevailed in what was a tough defensive matchup. Toronto managed to shoot just a bit better than Dallas, tallying success rates of 48.1 and 42.9 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively. The Mavs fell behind by a 30-22 score after one quarter and never could catch up against a suffocating Raptors defense that limited them to 37.8 percent shooting overall and a 25 percent mark from behind the arc.

DeMar DeRozan and Serge Ibaka co-led Toronto with matching 18-point efforts, with the former providing six assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block, and the latter supplying eight boards and one assist. P.J. Tucker drew the start and produced a near double-double with nine points, nine rebounds, three assists and four steals. Jonas Valanciunas matched Tucker's scoring total and added six rebounds, one assist and one steal. Cory Joseph generated a full stat line of eight points, seven rebounds and five assists. Patrick Patterson led the bench with 14 points, five rebounds and an assist. 

Harrison Barnes paced Dallas with 23 points, seven rebounds, two assists and three steals. Seth Curry poured in 11 points and added two assists, a rebound and a steal. Dirk Nowitzki registered nine points and five rebounds. Wesley Matthews (four points, six rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks) and Nerlens Noel (three points, eight rebounds, a block) provided modest but solid performances. Yogi Ferrell led the bench with 10 points, four rebounds, four assists and one steal.

The Raptors head back home to face the Orlando Magic on Monday evening, while the Mavericks remain home to tangle with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night as well.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the New York Knicks, 106-98, at AT&T Center on Saturday.

San Antonio were expected to win this game easily, but New York gave them a tough fight. It was a near wire-to-wire win for the Spurs though, as they held the lead for 47 minutes, with the Knicks one and only lead coming early in the first quarter. While San Antonio didn't dominate the statistics, they won nearly every one, winning the rebounding, assisting, steals, blocks, turnovers, fastbreak points and points in the paint differentials. Bench production was the only notable difference, with the Spurs scoring 37 bench points to the Knicks 13.

The Knicks (27-46) had a tough task here and nearly pulled out a huge upset win. Derrick Rose was New York's best player, as he tallied 24 points, five rebounds and five assists. Wily Hernangomez matched those 24 points, also adding 13 rebounds to his tally. Mindaugas Kuzminskas started for Carmelo Anthony and contributed 19 points and two assists. Courtney Lee collected six points, eight rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Kristaps Porzingis totaled just 12 points and five rebounds. New York's next game is on Monday against the Detroit Pistons.

The Spurs (56-16) have now won eight of their last 11 games, as they continue to battle the Golden State Warriors for the top-spot in the west. Kawhi Leonard was the player of the game accumulating 29 points, five rebounds, five assists and two blocks on 11-of-18 from the field. LaMarcus Aldridge amassed 19 points and 10 rebounds. Dewayne Dedmon started at center and scored five points to go with 13 rebounds. Pau Gaol recorded a double-double off the bench, accruing 19 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two blocks.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves by a 112-100 score at Moda Center on Saturday night. 

The Trail Blazers (34-38) came into Saturday's contest trying to keep the pressure on eighth-seeded Denver, which they could come within one game of catching with a win against the Timberwolves (28-44). Portland was able to take advantage of what was likely a tired Minnesota squad that had just given up 130 points on Friday night in an overtime loss to the Lakers.  The dynamic duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum once again led the way for the Blazers, which collectively shot an outstanding 62.5 percent from the floor and 50 percent from three-point range. Their offensive proficiency and 35-27 rebounding advantage helped them overcome 14 turnovers to cruise to a relatively comfortable home victory.

The Timberwolves were led by Andrew Wiggins, who supplied 20 points, two assists and one steal. Kris Dunn led the bench with 17 points, four rebounds, one assist and two steals. Karl-Anthony Towns and Ricky Rubio followed with matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds and a block, and the latter registering four rebounds, four assists and one steal. Gorgui Dieng totaled 13 points, seven rebounds, two assists, four steals and two blocks. Shabazz Muhammad matched Dieng's scoring total and added two rebounds off the bench.

McCollum's 32 points led the Blazers, a total he supplemented with four rebounds, four assists and one steal. Damian Lillard tallied 21 points, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals. Jusuf Nurkic provided a near double-double with 14 points, nine rebounds, four assists and a block. Allen Crabbe paced the second unit with 10 points, three boards and two blocks. Evan Turner and Al-Farouq Aminu were productive as reserves as well with matching eight-point efforts. 

The Timberwolves head to Indiana to tangle with the Pacers on Tuesday night, while the Trail Blazers head to Los Angeles to take on the Lakers on Sunday evening.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 129-108, at Verizon Center on Friday evening.

The Nets (15-57) had come into Friday's contest on somewhat of a hot streak by their standards, as they'd notched six victories during March, and two in a row for the first time all season. However, despite a strong shooting night once again, Brooklyn was brought back down to earth by an even more proficient Wizards (44-28) squad. John Wall, who battled through a migraine, and Bradley Beal turned in their usual solid performances, and the Washington bench combined to score a whopping 70 points to spearhead the blowout win.

The Nets were led by Justin Hamilton's 20 points off the second unit, which he supplemented with six boards and two assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson paced the starting five with 19 points, seven rebounds, two assists and one steal. Jeremy Lin supplied 14 points, three assists, one rebound and one block. Isaiah Whitehead, Archie Goodwin and K.J. McDaniels all generated 10-point efforts off the bench as well. Randy Foye tallied eight points, four rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Brook Lopez notably had a subpar effort with six points, seven rebounds and two assists.

Wall led the Wizards with 22 points, nine assists, four rebounds and one steal. Beal poured in 19 points and added three assists, a rebound and a steal. No other member of the starting five managed double digits in the scoring column, although Marcin Gortat had a near double-double with eight points and nine rebounds. Brandon Jennings led the second unit with 18 points, nine assists and three rebounds. Bojan Bogdanovic totaled 17 points, seven boards, two assists, a steal and a block. Ian Mahinmi managed 16 points, seven rebounds and four steals. Kelly Oubre, Jr. and Jason Smith were productive as reserves as well with nine and eight-point efforts, respectively.

The Nets next head south to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday afternoon, while the Wizards head to Cleveland for a Saturday night showdown with the Cavaliers.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 112-105, at Spectrum Center on Friday night. 

The Cavaliers (47-24) have been flirting with losing their hold on the Eastern Conference's top seed and entered Friday's contest just one game ahead of the Boston Celtics. LeBron James had called out himself and his teammates out after their latest loss, which came at the hands of the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. That made Friday's contest particularly important, and the Cavs responded like the defending champions they are. James spearheaded the charge with 32 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were excellent in supporting roles as well, combining for 41 points in their own right, and Cleveland shot an excellent 55.4 percent from the field overall. 

Irving followed James with 26 points, seven assists, a rebound and four steals. Love posted a 15-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included four assists. J.R. Smith tallied nine points and two rebounds, while Tristan Thompson provided eight points and seven boards. Kyle Korver led the second unit with eight points over 20 minutes.

Kemba Walker went toe-to-toe with Irving and posted 28 points, five assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block while leading the Hornets (32-40). Marco Belinelli was next with a bench-leading 22 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds and two assists. Nicolas Batum totaled 19 points, two boards, two assists and three steals. Cody Zeller posted a 15-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and two blocks. Marvin Williams accomplished the feat as well, managing 11 points, 11 boards, two assists, a steal and a block.

The Cavaliers remain home to tangle with the Washington Wizards on Saturday night, while the Hornets remain home to face the Phoenix Suns on Sunday afternoon.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 115-87, at Amway Center on Friday evening. 

The Magic (27-46) took control right from the start and maintained it by winning the first three quarters, on their way to the 28-point blowout win. They led by four after one quarter and increased the margin to 18, as they went into halftime with a 57-39 lead. The Magic scored 70 points over the second and third quarters, causing Stan Van Gundy to bench his starters for the fourth quarter. 

All five starters scored in double digits for the Magic, led by Terrence Ross, who finished with 18 points on 6-of-9 shooting, including 5-of-6 from long range. Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic followed up with 16 points each, while Elfrid Payton turned in his fourth triple-double in March, as he finished with 14 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, in 29 minutes. Jodie Meeks chipped in 15 points on 6-of-12 shooting, in 21 minutes off the bench, as he took advantage of some extended minutes in the fourth. The Magic have a couple of days off before they take on the Raptors in Toronto on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the Pistons (34-39) were simply not able to get it going, as they shot only 35.4 percent from the field and only 2-of-22 from long range. Tobias Harris was the only starter to score in double digits, as he finished with 11 points, while Andre Drummond grabbed 14 rebounds, to go along with six points, in 20 minutes. Jon Leuer was Detroit's high-point man, with 16 points, eight rebounds, two assists and a steal, in 28 minutes off the bench. Ish Smith only played 16 minutes, after drawing the start. Smith finished with six points and three rebounds. The Pistons next contest takes place on Monday, when they visit New York to take on the Knicks.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Indiana Pacers, 125-117, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday. 

It's rare to see Indiana struggle so badly at home, but that was just the case here. In fact, Denver pulled out a wire-to-wire win, as they held a double-digit lead for over half of this game. Free-throw shooting was a glaring difference, with Denver going 40-of-43 from the free-throw line, while Indiana went just 8-of-11. Rebounding was crucial for the Nuggets as well, with Denver winning that battle, 46-39.

The Nuggets (35-37) are holding on to the eight-seed in the west by a fingernail, as this was a crucial road win for that pursuit. Nikola Jokic led the way for Denver. as he tallied 30 points, 17 rebounds and five assists on 12-of-18 from the field. Wilson Chandler finished second on the team, totaling 24 points, four rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Danilo Gallinari made his return from a knee injury to amass 21 points and 11 rebounds. On deck for the Nuggets is a home matchup versus the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday.

The Pacers (36-36) had traded off wins and losses in their previous 15 games, but this defeat snapped that streak. Paul George led Indiana, as he accumulated 27 points, nine rebounds, three assists and three steals. Myles Turner collected 20 points, four rebounds, two steals and four blocks. Jeff Teague accrued 21 points, two rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Monta Ellis led the bench with 17 points.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 117-107, at United Center on Friday. 

Chicago was expected to win this game easily, but Philadelphia had other ideas. They did most of their damage in the middle quarters, as they outscored the Bulls, 69-43, in the second and third quarter. Shooting was the glaring difference, with the Sixers shooting 55 percent to the Bulls 41 percent. Philadelphia also took care of the glass, winning the rebounding battle, 46-39. It wasn't just the rebounding, as the Sixers outscored the Bulls, 70-30, in the paint. 

The Sixers (27-45) have really struggled recently, but they're still playing as hard as anyone. Dario Saric led the way, as he collected 32 points and 10 rebounds. T.J. McConnell was the only other starter in double figures, as he accrued 10 points, five rebounds, eight assists and three steals.

Bobby Portis played well off the bench, amassing 17 points and 11 rebounds on 8-of-11 from the field. Rajon Rondo accumulated four points, four rebounds, five assists and four steals.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the visiting Atlanta Hawks, 100-97, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening. 

The Bucks (37-35) led by eight after a strong first quarter, but the Hawks pushed back to make it a two-point game heading into half time. The Hawks (37-35) continued to apply pressure, as they jumped ahead by two heading into the fourth. The game went right down to the wire, as the teams traded buckets and the lead throughout the fourth, until it was tied up at 96 with 29 seconds to go. Greg Monroe put the Bucks up by two with a layup with 17 seconds left, before Dwight Howard was fouled and made 1-of-2 at the line, making it a one-point game. Khris Middleton then nailed two free throws, to take the three-point lead and ultimately seal the win. This was a huge win for the Bucks, as they are now tied with the Hawks for fifth place in the East.

Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee, with 34 points on 13-of-22 shooting, to go along with 13 rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two steals, in 36 minutes. Malcolm Brogdon and Greg Monroe chipped in 14 points each, while Tony Snell added 13. This marked the third straight win for the Bucks, who now look ahead to Sunday, when they play host to the Bulls. 

Meanwhile, three players topped 20 points for Atlanta, while no one else scored in double digits. Dennis Schroder was the high-point man with 28, while Tim Hardaway Jr. followed up with 25 points. Dwight Howard double-doubled with 20 points and 12 rebounds, in 32 minutes of action. This marked the sixth straight loss for the Hawks, as their struggles only worsened when Paul Millsap went down with a knee injury four games ago. The Hawks will look to break the ugly streak when they play host to the Nets on Sunday.

Los Angeles (21-51) snapped a six-game losing streak on Friday, though it may not have been in their best interest.  LA will lose its draft pick if it falls outside of the top three, and the Phoenix Suns remain on the Lakers' tail for the second-worst record in the NBA.  Still, there was a lot to like on Friday for Lakers fans.  Guard Jordan Clarkson had a career-high 35 points while shooting 8-of-10 from three-point range.  It was the team's first overtime game of the season, and they seemed to respond well to the extra period.  LA outscored Minnesota 21-10 in overtime, immediately establishing an eight-point advantage at the start of the OT.  The team finished with staggering shooting splits of 52 percent from the field, 61 percent from three-point range, and 86 percent form the line.  

Minnesota (28-43), meanwhile, extended its own losing streak to four games.  While production from the starting five was solid, the Timberwolves struggled once again with finding points off the bench.  The team saw just 23 bench points versus 39 from LA.  There was no issue for Minny's starters, though, as third-year forward Andrew Wiggins exploded for an efficient 36 points.  Reigning Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a double-double with 25 points and 13 rebounds, and point guard Ricky Rubio had 19 points while dishing out a whopping 15 assists.

The Timberwolves will visit Portland on Saturday, while LA will host the Blazers on Sunday.

												The host Golden State Warriors demolished the Sacramento Kings on Friday, 114-100.

Golden State (58-14) is on the verge of its third straight 60-win season, holding the league's top record with just 10 games remaining.  Fans got to enjoy pure star power on Friday, as the Warriors breezed by the Kings on the backs of two of their healthy All-Stars.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry was the team leader in scoring, pouring in 27 points, and also contributed six steals on the defensive end.  All-Defense forward Draymond Green, meanwhile, had three steals and a block while scoring 23 points.  The two more than made up for a cold night from sharpshooter Klay Thompson, who went just 3-of-14 from the field.  The night was just one of many great ones for the historic Warriors offense, as the team shot almost 50 percent from the field while dishing out a ridiculous 37 assists. 

Sacramento (27-45) is far from the top, as the team dropped its fourth straight game on Friday in miserable fashion.   The team showed promise, however, as recently-acquired rookie Buddy Hield had arguably his best game as a pro.  Hield scored a team-high 22 points to go along with eight rebounds and seven assists.  It was also a big night for the Kings' other rookie sensation, Skal Labissiere.  Just a week after becoming the first member of the 2016 draft class to score 30 points, Labissiere narrowly missed his first career triple-double, coming away with 10 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists.  

Golden State will host the Grizzlies on Sunday, while the Kings will visit the LA Clippers.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 126-98, at Barclays Center on Thursday evening.

The Nets (15-56) came into Thursday on what could, by their standards, be considered a hot streak. They'd tallied five victories in 12 games in March but they were chasing a particularly significant win against the Suns (22-50). Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32-22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30-18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74-48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 36.6 percent success rate from the field and 28.8 percent figure from three-point range while also causing 19 turnovers.

Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block. Alex Len followed with an 11-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one assist, two steals and two blocks. Tyler Ulis chipped in with a 10-point, 12-assist double-double that also featured a pair of steals. Leandro Barbosa paced the second unit with 11 points, six boards, one assist and one steal.

Brook Lopez led the way for the Nets with 19 points, six rebounds and one block. K.J. McDaniels followed with a bench-leading 16 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Trevor Booker managed 14 points, eight boards and one assist. Jeremy Lin tallied 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Archie Goodwin and Quincy Acy contributed matching 12-point efforts as reserves. Isaiah Whitehead compiled 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block over 28 minutes. Justin Hamilton supplied 10 points and one rebound. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest five points but hauled in 16 boards, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and posted one block. 

The Suns next head to Boston to take on the Celtics on Friday night, while the Nets head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Friday evening as well.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Miami Heat 101-84 Thursday at AmericanAirlines Arena. 

The Heat (35-37) got off to a strong start on both sides of the ball, as they opened up a 10-point lead in the first quarter. From that point, however, it was all Raptors (43-29). Over the course of the next three quarters, Toronto outscored Miami by 27 points thanks in large part to the tremendous play of All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who scored a game-high 40 points on 14-of-25 shooting from the field. DeRozan was the only starter to score in double figures for the Raptors, but the team's bench managed to come up with an important 36 points, led by 14 points from Norman Powell and 13 from Delon Wright. 

As for the Heat, six different players managed to score in double figures, but they failed to get a standout performance to counter that of DeRozan's in some way. Hassan Whiteside ended up leading the way with a team-high 16 points and 14 rebounds, but no other Miami player scored more than 13 points. The poor offensive play was contagious across the board, as the team shot just 39 percent from the field and 26 percent from behind the arc in Thursday's contest. It was a crucial loss for the Heat, as they now hold just a one-game advantage over both the Bulls and Pistons for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 97-95, at American Airlines Center on Thursday. 

Dallas have now beat Los Angeles twice this season in three games, as they clearly match up well with this Clipper team. It was tightly contested though, as there were 10 ties and 11 lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 12 points. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive, as Dallas recorded 26 assists to nine turnovers, while Los Angeles committed 17 turnovers to just 18 assists. 

The Clippers (43-30) had a tough task here against a desperate Mavs team and they fell just short in this tight battle. Blake Griffin led the way for Los Angeles, as he tallied 21 points, five rebounds and two assists. DeAndre Jordan recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points, 18 rebounds and two blocks. Chris Paul finished with 15 points, six rebounds, six assists and three steals. On deck for the Clippers is a home matchup against the Utah Jazz on Saturday.

The Mavericks (31-40) are trying to keep their playoffs hope alive and this win can only help that pursuit. Seth Curry scored a game-high 23 points to lead Dallas, as he also added three rebounds and four assists to his tally. Harrison Barnes was the hero, as he scored 21 points in addition to hitting the go-ahead jumper with one minute left, following that up with a crucial steal. Dirk Nowitzki accrued 14 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals. Nerlens Noel got the start and collected eight points, 12 rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks.

												The host San Antonio Spurs beat the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, 97-90.

The Spurs (55-16) look poised for a second straight 60-win season as they continue to roll as the season draws to a close.  San Antonio remains two games back from first place in the Western Conference, but still has plenty of time to overtake Golden State for the league's top record.  On Thursday, All-Star forward LaMarcus Aldridge found his groove and helped lead the Spurs offense past the tough grit-and-grind Grizzlies.  Aldridge led the team with 23 points on 10-of-16 shooting.  Superstar Kawhi Leonard had a bit of an off night despite still pouring in 19 points.  Leonard shot under 50 percent from the field and went a sub-par 4-of-7 from the free-throw line.  

Memphis (40-32) has now dropped two straight after a four-game win streak earlier in the month.  The Grizzlies have fallen to seventh place in the Western Conference, allowing themselves to be eclipsed by the Thunder for sixth.  Memphis struggled against the Spurs' top-ranked defense, shooting just 43 percent from the field on the night.  Only two Grizzlies scored in double digits, with only Mike Conley eclipsing 20 points.  Conley scored 22, while All-Star center Marc Gasol added 13 points and 10 rebounds.  

San Antonio will host the Knicks on Saturday, while the Grizzlies visit Golden State on Sunday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the New York Knicks 110-95 at Moda Center on Thursday. 

The Trail Blazers (33-38) had no trouble handling the injured Knicks (27-45) roster that saw both starters Carmelo Anthony (knee) and Derrick Rose (foot) sidelined. Without two of their go-to players, Kristaps Porzingis drew most of the touches on offense, while Willy Hernangomez, Mindaugas Kuzminskas and Ron Baker drew starts. 

Portland scored 67 points in the first half and were able to go to cruise control for the second half, as the defensively inefficient Knicks had no answer for the backcourt scoring the Blazers brought in the contest.  Damian Lillard led all scorers with 30 points, to go with five assists and four rebounds on 9-of-17 shooting, while C.J. McCollum added 20 points in the win. Evan Turner and Allen Crabbe saw 24 minutes and 34 minutes, respectively, while combining for 21 points off the bench. 

Porzingis led all Knicks scorers with 18 points on 21 shots, while adding nine rebounds, one assist, one steal and three blocks. Hernangomez went 5-of-10 from the field, scored 10 points and added eight rebounds. The Knicks shot just 22.7 percent from behind the arc and 40.9 percent from the field. 

Both teams play on Saturday, as the Blazers host the Minnesota Timberwolves, while the Knicks visit the San Antonio Spurs.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic, 109-102, at Amway Center on Wednesday night.

The Hornets (32-39) came into Wednesday's contest looking to keep their faint playoff hopes alive and to complete a  season sweep of the Magic (26-46). Given that they'd blasted Orlando by 40 points in their most recent meeting, it appeared the chances for another win were high. The hosts had other plans, though, as they jumped out to a 54-48 halftime lead. However, led by a superb bench effort from Marco Belinelli and an equally impressive one from Kemba Walker, Charlotte outscored the Magic by a 32-20 margin in the fourth quarter to post their third consecutive win. 

Walker led the way for the Hornets with 22 points, seven assists and three rebounds. Belinelli followed with a second unit-leading 20 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds, one assist and one steal. Frank Kaminsky III was productive in a reserve role as well with 18 points (13 which came in the fourth quarter), five boards, an assist and a block. Cody Zeller followed with 15 points, six rebounds, two assists and three steals. Nicolas Batum provided a full stat line of 10 points, six assists, two rebounds and two steals. Marvin Williams managed a modest seven points but hauled in 10 rebounds and dished out two assists.

Terrence Ross paced the Magic with 19 points, two rebounds, one assist and two steals. Evan Fournier poured in 15 points and added four boards, three assists and a steal. Elfrid Payton matched Fournier's point total and added five rebounds and five assists. Nikola Vucevic posted a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included eight assists, three blocks and one steal. Jodie Meeks led the bench with 10 points and a pair of boards.

The Hornets head back home to face off with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday evening, while the Magic remain home to tangle with the Detroit Pistons on Friday night.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Indiana Pacers, 109-100, at TD Garden on Wednesday.

This concludes the season sweep for Boston in this series, as they thoroughly dominated Indiana all year. Shooting was key for the Celtics, as they shot over 51 percent, while the Pacers couldn't crack 44 percent from the field. Boston also took care of the defensive rebounding, winning that battle, 33-27. The Celtics also recorded 27 assists, while the Pacers could only muster up 20. 

The Pacers (36-35) continue their unbelievable run of mediocrity, as they have now traded off wins and losses across their last 15 games. Paul George carried the load, as he tallied 37 points, five rebounds, two assists and three steals. Jeff Teague was the only other player for Indiana to reach double figures in scoring, as he accrued 25 points, two rebounds and six assists on 10-of-15 shooting. Myles Turner accumulated seven points, nine rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Lavoy Allen led the bench with eight points and 14 rebounds. On deck for the Pacers is a home matchup against the Denver Nuggets on Friday.

The Celtics (46-26) have now won five of their last six games, as they continue to battle for the top-spot in the east. Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston, as he collected 25 points and five assists. Avery Bradley finished second on the team, totaling 18 points and eight rebounds. Al Horford flirted with a triple-double, amassing 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Boston will host the Phoenix Suns on Friday for their next matchup.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Detroit Pistons, 117-95, at United Center on Wednesday night.

The Bulls (34-38) came into Wednesday's contest missing big man Robin Lopez, who'd been suspended for his part in a fight with the Raptors' Serge Ibaka on Tuesday evening. His absence was potentially hurtful, as Lopez had been playing a much larger role in the offense following Dwyane Wade's season-ending elbow injury. However, Joffrey Lauvergne, who'd shown flashes of offensive prowess during his limited opportunities in Denver and Oklahoma City, stepped up in his spot start to post 17 points, seven rebounds, three assists and one steal. Meanwhile, Nikola Mirotic made the most of his starting role as well, as he tallied a game-high 28 points to go along with five boards, two assists, three steals and one block. Chicago also blew open a close game in the second half by outscoring the Pistons (34-38) by a 58-42 margin over the third and fourth quarters.

The Pistons were led by matching 14-point efforts from Tobias Harris and Maurice Morris. The former added four boards, three assists and one steal, while the latter posted three rebounds and one assist. Ish Smith ran with the first unit in pace of Reggie Jackson and delivered nine points, seven assists, one rebound and three steals. Andre Drummond generated a modest eight points but also brought down 17 rebounds and recorded a block. Jon Leuer led the bench with 13 points, six rebounds and one assist while Stanley Johnson totaled 12 points and three boards. 

Jimmy Butler was next behind Mirotic and Lauvergne with a 16-point, 12-assist double-double that also included two steals. Paul Zipser turned in 15 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Rajon Rondo supplied only five points but did add nine assists, two rebounds and a steal. Bobby Portis led the second unit with 12 points, six rebounds and a pair of assists.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 122-97, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday. 

This was a lopsided matchup on paper and the Thunder left no doubt with this dominating result. In fact, Oklahoma City held a double-digit lead for the entirety of the second half, while leading by at least 20 points for the whole fourth quarter. Oklahoma City ended up shooting 55 percent from the field, while holding Philly to just 43 percent. The rebounding differential was glaring, with the Thunder winning that battle, 54-25. The 76 points in the paint was also huge for OKC, as that marked a season-high. 

The Sixers (26-45) continue to play shorthanded and results like this are inevitable with their best player sidelined. Nik Stauskas was a bright spot for Philly, as he led the team with 20 points off the bench. Dario Saric was the best starter, as he accumulated 12 points, two rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Robert Covington matched Saric's 12 points, adding three rebounds and a block to his tally. Shawn Long finished second on the team, totaling 13 points and six rebounds off the bench. On deck for the Sixers is a road matchup against the Chicago Bulls on Friday. 

The Thunder (41-30) now have 26 wins at home, as they've made Chesapeake Energy Arena an absolute fortress. Russell Westbrook set another record, as he became the first ever player to record a triple-double, while not missing a shot. Westbrook finished the game with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists on 6-of-6 from the field. Enes Kanter led the team in scoring, as he provided 24 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Victor Oladipo accrued 18 points, two rebounds and an assist. Oklahoma City will be off until Sunday, when they face the Houston Rockets on the road.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Atlanta Hawks 104-100 Wednesday at Verizon Center.

After the Hawks (37-34) had control of the game in the first half and entered the locker room with a six-point lead, the Wizards (43-28) came storming back and the two teams entered the final period all tied up. Ultimately, Washington managed to push their lead to 12 points with just over three minutes to go, and while Atlanta was able to chip away in the closing moments, they eventually just ran out of time. It wasn't a great shooting night for John Wall, who shot just 6-of-21 from the field, but he still managed to finished with a double-double of 22 points and 10 assists in 34 minutes. Bradley Beal led the way scoring for the team, finishing with a team-high 28 points in 36 minutes. 

As for the Hawks, they were led by Tim Hardaway Jr., who had a very productive night as the team's starting shooting guard. The former Michigan standout finished with a game-high 29 points on 9-of-16 shooting from the field. Dwight Howard was effective down low as well, posting yet another double-double of 14 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, but overall for Atlanta, it was a forgettable offensive night. The team shot a subpar 39.5 percent from the field en route to their fifth straight loss, and they remain just one game ahead of the Pacers for fifth place in the Eastern Conference.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 126-113 Wednesday at Pepsi Center. 

The altitude proved to be to much for the visiting team, as the Nuggets had no problem warding off the defending champions on their home floor. After a dominate second quarter, Denver entered halftime with a 14-point advantage and never let up from that point, as what has been a struggling Cavaliers (46-24) defense couldn't slow down the fact-paced Nuggets. It was required a complete team effort Wednesday to take down Cleveland, with seven different players managing to score in double figures. Gary Harris led the way scoring 21 points, while his backup off the bench, Will Barton, wasn't too far behind as he finished with 20 points in 33 minutes as a reserve. As a team, the Nuggets shot a scorching hot 51.3 percent from the field and 42.3 percent from behind the arc in the victory.

On the other hand, with the loss, the Cavaliers have now lost five of their last seven road games, and they didn't get much help Wednesday night outside of Kyrie Irving and LeBron James. Irving finished with a game-high 33 points in 27 minutes, while James finished with a solid all-around performance of 18 points, six rebounds and five assists. The only spark off the bench was Derrick Williams, who shot an impressive 8-of-10 from the field en route to scoring 19 points, but no other Cleveland player managed to score in double figures. The loss leaves the Cavaliers just one game ahead of the Celtics for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference standings.

												The Milwaukee Bucks blew out the host Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, 116-98.

Milwaukee (36-35) finally crept above .500 as the team enters an air-tight Eastern Conference playoff race.  The Bucks lagged for most of the season but have seen a stretch of stellar play recently thanks in large part to the return of dynamic wing Khris Middleton.  Wednesday's win was one of Milwaukee's more convincing victories, as the team held a double-digit lead fairly consistently.  The highlight of the night was the performance of emerging superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 32 points on 12-of-22 shooting.  It was the rest of the Greek Freak's stat line that was especially impressive, though, as he pulled down 13 rebounds to go along with six assists, two steals, and a block while not turning the ball over once.  

Sacramento (27-44) has seen things turn fairly bleak after trading away star center DeMarcus Cousins.  The team has won just two games in its last 11 contests and saw an embarrassing loss at home on Wednesday.  Defensive lapses were the story for the Kings, as they allowed the Bucks to shoot a whopping 54 percent from the field and bury 16 three-pointers.  Three-point shooting on Sacramento's end, meanwhile, has been a problem area.  The Kings hit only nine three-pointers and have seen a sharp decline in both three-point makes and attempts since their deadline dealings.  

The Kings will play in Golden State on Friday, while Milwaukee will host the Atlanta Hawks.

												The host Utah Jazz defeated the New York Knicks on Wednesday, 108-101.

Utah (44-28) earned a much-needed win thanks in large part to the play of center Rudy Gobert.  Gobert scored a new career high with 35 points on a mind-boggling 13-of-14 from the field.  Gobert, one of the front-runners for the Defensive Player of the Year award, also blocked four shots and pulled down 13 rebounds.  The ridiculous efficiency the Jazz got out of Gobert lifted the team's shooting percentage to a respectable 46 percent despite cold nights from a number of other players.  This included a 6-of-17 shooting night from All-Star forward Gordon Hayward.  Another area in which the Jazz excelled was turnovers.  The team coughed the ball up just seven times on the night.  

New York (27-44) has struggled mightily of late and looks poised to finish in the lottery yet again as the season comes to an end.   Knicks fans did see hope for the future exhibited on Wednesday, as sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis had an excellent outing.  Porzingis led the team with 24 points and also pulled down seven rebounds.  However, the Knicks still fell short and walked away with their eighth loss in their last 11 games.  

The Jazz will visit the Clippers on Saturday, while the Knicks will see Portland on Thursday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Chicago Bulls in overtime, 122-120, at Air Canada Centre on Tuesday night.

The game was not for the faint of heart, as it featured a bit of everything. That included a third-quarter fight that saw Chicago's Robin Lopez Toronto's Serge Ibaka both get ejected, as well as a rally in the fourth quarter by the Raptors (42-29) from a 94-79 deficit. In overtime, Toronto looked like it had pulled away when it forged a 122-117 edge with just nine seconds remaining after two free throws from DeMar DeRozan but Jimmy Butler's three-pointer with two seconds left brought the Bulls (33-38) back within two. DeRozan missed a shot on the ensuing possession but the Raptors were able to grab the offensive rebound, sealing the win. 

Butler paced the Bulls with 37 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, two blocks and one steal. Rajon Rondo followed with 24 points, eight assists, five rebounds and four steals. Lopez had 12 points, four rebounds, one assist and three blocks in 25 minutes before exiting. Paul Zipser drew the start and also pitched in with 12 points, along with five rebounds, four assists, two blocks and one steal. Bobby Portis led the bench with nine points and five boards.

The Raptors were led by DeMar DeRozan, who poured in 42 points and added eight assists, seven rebounds, one steal and one block. Cory Joseph tallied 19 points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. Ibaka posted 16 points, six boards and one assist prior to his ejection. DeMarre Carroll and Jonas Valanciunas supplied matching eight-point efforts, while Norman Powell led the second unit with nine points, two rebounds and one assist.

The Bulls head back home to tangle with the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, while the Raptors head down to Miami for a Thursday night showdown with the Miami Heat.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Detroit Pistons, 98-96, at Barclays Center on Tuesday evening. 

The Nets (14-56) may sport the worst record in the league, but they may be one of the feistiest cellar dwellers in the history of the NBA. Brooklyn has kept their competitive spirit thriving despite the disappointing season, and has often played as if they're capable of beating virtually any team in the NBA on the right night. The Pistons (34-37) were the latest unit to learn that lesson the hard way, as they first saw the Nets storm back from a 31-22 first-quarter deficit to forge a six-point halftime lead by outscoring Detroit, 28-13, in the second quarter. They added to that advantage in the third before the Pistons staged a rally of their own in the fourth, coming back from a 94-87 deficit with 1:52 to play to tie the game at both 94 and 96 in the closing seconds. Taking the ball for a final possession with two seconds remaining, the Nets saw Brook Lopez drain a jumper off a Randy Foye assist as time expired for the win. 

Tobias Harris led the way for Detroit with 24 points, five boards, one assist, three blocks and two steals. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope followed with 19 points, four rebounds and three assists. Andre Drummond contributed a 13-point, 17-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two blocks and one steal. Maurice Morris matched Drummond's point total and added four boards, two assists and a block. With Reggie Jackson struggling with his shot again, Ish Smith came off the bench to lead the second unit with 16 points, seven rebounds, four assists, three steals and one block over 28 minutes.

Lopez paced the Nets with a game-high 29 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds and one assist. Caris LeVert supplied 15 points, two boards, one assist and one steal. K.J. McDaniels led the bench with 11 points, two boards and one assist. Spencer Dinwiddie drew the start for Jeremy Lin (ankle) and filled out the stat sheet with 10 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Archie Goodwin matched Dinwiddie's point total off the bench and complemented it with five rebounds, three assists and two blocks.

The Pistons head to the Windy City to tangle with the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night, while the Nets remain home and await the Phoenix Suns on Thursday evening.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns, 112-97, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday. 

Miami were expected to win this game easily and they left no doubt with a dominating second half. In fact, the Heat won the two middle quarters, 61-37, while the Suns could never get within double-digits in the second half. Rebounding was a huge factor, with Miami winning that battle, 51-40. They also destroyed the Suns through three-point shooting, as the Heat hit 11-of-27, while Phoenix went just 4-of-16 from long range. A 24-15 turnover margin really killed the Suns as well, with the Heat recording 13 steals. 

The Suns (22-49) have now lost five-straight games, as they continue to look forward to the offseason. Devin Booker really struggled, as he tallied 11 points, four rebounds and five assists, but committed seven turnovers on 4-of-16 shooting. Marquese Chris led the team in scoring, amassing 24 points and seven rebounds on 7-of-9 from the field. Alex Len recorded a double-double, totaling 12 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks. Phoenix has a decent chance to snap this slide in their next game, as they take on the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday. 

The Heat (35-36) have now won 24 of their last 30 games, as Miami have become one of the most dangerous teams in the league. Hassan Whiteside led the way for Miami, as he accumulated 23 points, 14 rebounds, three steals and two blocks. Goran Dragic finished second among starters, picking up 16 points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals. Tyler Johnson was huge off the bench, providing 17 points, six rebounds, four assists and five steals. The Heat will look to keep rolling on Thursday against the Toronto Raptors.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 95-82, at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday.

These are two of the hottest teams in the Western Conference right now and New Orleans showed that their season is still alive with this crucial win. It was a tale of two halves, as Memphis took a seven-point lead into the locker room, while New Orleans responded by winning the second half, 61-41. Rebounding was key for the Pelicans, as they won that battle, 51-42. The big men of New Orleans dominated in the paint, outscoring the Grizzlies, 46-32. 

The Grizzlies (40-31) had won four-straight headed into this matchup, but the Pelicans are a scary opponent to face right now. Mike Conley led Memphis, as he tallied 16 points, six rebounds and three assists. Marc Gasol totaled 10 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two steals. No one else on the roster had more than 12 points or four assists.

The Pelicans (30-41) have now won five of their last six games, as they have the best defense in the NBA across their last 10 games based on efficiency ratings. DeMarcus Cousins had his best game for New Orleans, as he collected 41 points, 17 rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks. Anthony Davis finished second on the team, amassing 19 points and 13 rebounds. Jrue Holiday was the only other starter with more than five points, as he provided 11 points, three rebounds and six assists.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Dallas Mavericks 112-87 Tuesday at American Airlines Center. 

Despite playing their second game in a row and their third game in four days, the Warriors (57-14) had very little problem handling the Mavericks (30-40) on Tuesday night. Dallas managed to keep it close for 12 minutes, holding a two-point lead after the end of the first quarter. But from there, Golden State managed to blow the game wide open, outscoring the Mavericks by 27 points over the next 36 minutes of game time. The Warriors were led by Klay Thompson, who scored a game-high 23 points on 9-of-15 shooting, while Steph Curry added 17 points, nine assists and five rebounds of his own. Ian Clark put together a great performance off the bench as well, scoring 18 points on 8-of-16 shooting. As a team, Golden State shot a very effective 55 percent from the field and 41 percent from long range.

The Mavericks, on the other hand, were not as fortunate with their shooting, as they shot just 35 percent from the field overall, and despite shooting 14 more shots than Golden State, they made 10 less. They were led by 16 points and nine rebounds from Dirk Nowitzki, with Nerlens Noel scoring an efficient 14 points in 17 minutes to go along with seven rebounds off the bench. But overall, it was a forgettable offensive night for Dallas, who, with the loss, are now three games behind the Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 100-93 Tuesday at Target Center. 

While they ended up winning by a comfortable seven points, Tuesday's victory wasn't easy for the Spurs (54-16), as the team found themselves down by as many as 12 points in the first half. Then, after a bounce-back third quarter, San Antonio managed to enter the final period with a six-point lead and hold on despite one last run from the Timberwolves (28-42). The team was led offensively by LaMarcus Aldridge, who scored a game-high 26 points on 12-of-24 shooting from the field. Meanwhile, All-Star swingman Kawhi Leonard had just two points after the first 24 minutes, but he managed to kick it into high gear and score 20 of his 22 points in the second half, which included the go-ahead jumper late in the fourth quarter. The win was the Spurs' second in a row and they will now return home for a four-game homestand. 

As for the Timberwolves, the loss was not only their fourth in a row, but after blowing a 12-point lead, it is the team's league-leading 18th loss this season after blowing a double-digit lead. They have also now given up at least 100 points in seven straight contests. Offensively, Karl-Anthony Towns led the way with yet another double-double of a team-high 25 points and 14 rebounds, while Andrew Wiggins added 22 points of his own. The two, however, combined to shoot just 13-of-32 from the field, and they ended up doing a majority of their work at the free throw line, where the young stars hit 20 of their 23 attempts. Unfortunately for Minnesota, the two didn't get much help, as the only other teammate to score in double figures was Shabazz Muhammad, who scored 18 points in 24 minutes off the bench.

												The visiting Milwaukee Bucks took down the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, 93-90.

Milwaukee (35-35) has now won nine of its last 11 games and is making a solid push for the Eastern Conference playoff thanks to its strong recent play.  On Tuesday, the Bucks caught a bit of a break, winning by just three points while Portland missed ten free-throws on the night.  It was a relatively poor offensive night in general for both teams, as Milwaukee shot 42 percent from the field and reached the line only 12 times.  Despite this, wing duo Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo performed well.  Middleton shot 11-of-22 and led the team with 26 points, while Antetokounmpo had 22 points to go along with eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks, and a steal.  The game brought Milwaukee up to seventh place in the East after being out of the playoff picture for much of the season.  

Portland (32-38) currently sits at ninth place in the Western Conference and needs every win it can get going forwards.  The Trail Blazers saw another strong performance out of star player Damian Lillard, who scored 31 points along with seven assists and four steals.  Since the deadline, newly-acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic has hit his stride for Portland, and that was certainly the case on Tuesday.  Nurkic pulled down a team-high 14 rebounds and blocked two shots and stole the ball twice.  The Blazers will need to finish strong in order to surpass Denver for eighth in the West and a secure playoff spot.  

The Bucks will visit Sacramento on Wednesday, while Portland will host the Knicks on Thursday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers took down the host Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 133-109.

The Clippers (43-29) came off a convincing win on Monday by blowing out their hometown rival Lakers on Tuesday.  The starting backcourt of Chris Paul and J.J. Redick was dominant, with Paul pouring in 27 points and Redick adding 24.   Perimeter play was the driving force of the dominant win, as the Clips shot over 53 percent from the field while sinking 15 three-pointers.  Another area in which the Clippers thrived was free-throw shooting; the team reached the line 32 times and hit a whopping 28 free-throws on the night. 

The Lakers (20-51) are on a six-game losing streak and appear to be right where they want to be, as the team shut down many of its veterans for the remainder of the season in part due to desire to keep their own draft pick.  Tuesday's loss at Staples Center was a particularly brutal one, however, as the team fell to its divisional rival on its home court.  The team shot just 63 percent from the free-throw line and went an abysmal 5-of-19 from beyond the arc.  One bright spot for the Lakers, however, was rookie Brandon Ingram, who led the team with 21 points on 8-of-14 shooting.  

The Clippers will visit Dallas on Thursday, while the Lakers will host the Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 105-90, at Spectrum Center on Monday night. 

The Hornets (31-39) came into Monday's contest still chasing the playoff dream, a quest that has been made exponentially difficult with recent losses. Charlotte needed the home win to remain within striking distance of the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference and accomplished the feat on the strength of solid shooting, a 64-49 run in the middle quarters, and a strong defensive effort against the dangerous Dennis Schroder. The Hawks (37-33) also committed 15 turnovers and couldn't get their three-point game on track, as they shot just 32.4 percent from long range. Charlotte prevailed by a comfortable margin despite losing the rebounding battle, 45-33.

Atlanta did see all five members of their starting five hit double digits in the scoring column, beginning with Schroder, who tallied 20 points, six assists, three rebounds and two blocks. Dwight Howard followed with a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists, a steal and a block. Ersan Ilyasova drew another start for Paul Millsap (knee) and matched Howard's scoring total while adding six boards and one assist. Tim Hardaway, Jr. and Thabo Sefolosha provided matching 11-point efforts, with the former supplying three assists and one rebound and the latter posting eight rebounds, four assists and one block. Rookie Taurean Prince continued his solid play with 11 points, four rebounds and one assist while leading the bench.

The backcourt duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum posted 16-point efforts to lead the Hornets. Walker added four rebounds, four assists and one steal while Batum registered six assists, one rebound and one steal. Marvin Williams managed 13 points, eight rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (nine points, three assists, two rebounds, three steals) and Cody Zeller (eight points, five rebounds) turned in modest efforts but Frank Kaminsky III led the bench with 14 points, five assists, three rebounds, two blocks and one steal.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 112-109, in overtime at Amway Center on Monday. 

This was a tale of two halves, as these lottery contenders left it all on the floor. The Sixers actually took a 15-point lead into the half, but the Magic responded by sending the game into overtime. It was tight throughout, as there were 11 ties and 10 lead changes in total. The difference for Orlando was their ability to get to the free-throw line, as they finished the game 38-of-46 from the charity stripe. Both teams really struggled shooting, as they both failed to crack 39 percent from the field and 26 percent from three-point range.

The Sixers (26-44) had to play this game extremely shorthanded and they didn't have enough to hold on to a big lead. Richaun Holmes got the start and had the game of his career though, totaling 24 points, 14 rebounds and four assists. Robert Covington was just as good, accruing 24 points, 13 rebounds, four steals and two blocks. Dario Saric finished with 16 points and five rebounds before fouling out in regulation. T.J. McConnell amassed 16 points, 11 assists and three steals. Nik Stauskas was the only bench player with more than four points, as he provided 20 points and five rebounds. On deck for Philly is a road matchup versus the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday. 

The Magic (26-45) have been struggling mightily, but this overtime win may give them some momentum for the final few weeks. Nikola Vucevic led the way for Orlando, as he collected 26 points and 13 rebounds. Evan Fournier finished second on the team with 19 points, four rebounds and three assists. Elfrid Payton tallied 10 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and three steals. Aaron Gordon produced 17 points, three rebounds and four assists before fouling out. Orlando's next game will be a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Utah Jazz 107-100 Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 

Paul George struggled for most of Monday's contest, but when the Pacers (36-34) needed him the most, the All-Star came though. With just 20 seconds remaining in the contest and his team up three, George let the clock wind down before pulling up from just behind the foul line. The jumper was good, and George's shot gave the Pacers their fifth straight home victory. George finished with 19 points on a poor 6-of-20 shooting from the field, but that sixth made field goal was all Indiana needed. Jeff Teague ended up leading the way offensive for the team, scoring a team-high 21 points to go along with 5 rebounds and five assists. 

As for the Jazz (43-28), they got a heroic performance from their own All-Star, Gordon Hayward, as he put up a career-high 38 points on 16-of-24 shooting from the field, but in the end, it just wasn't enough. That was thanks in large part to the lack of depth Utah showed Monday night, as the seven reserves that saw for the floor for the Jazz combined to score just 17 points while four of the five starters scored in double figures. The Jazz have now lost three straight games to end their road trip out east, but they still sit 1.5 games ahead of the Clippers for the No. 4 seed.

Up next, the Pacers will head to Boston on Wednesday to take on the Celtics, while the Jazz will head home Wednesday to take on the Knicks.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Washington Wizards 110-102 Monday at TD Garden.

The final score isn't a great indicator for how much the Celtics (45-26) dominated Monday's game, as the game was essentially over by the end of the third quarter when Boston held a 17-point advantage heading into the final period. Isaiah Thomas once again led the way for the Celtics, scoring a game-high 25 points despite shooting just 2-of-10 from behind the arc. His partner in the backcourt Avery Bradley had a much more efficient outing, scoring 20 points on 8-of-16 shooting from the field and 4-of-8 shooting from long range. In the end, it wasn't the prettiest shooting performance from Boston, as they hit just 42.6 percent of their shots, but their ability to get offensive rebounds helped them overcome those misses, as they grabbed 20 by the time Monday's contest was over. 

For the Wizards (42-28), they actually shot better from the field than the Celtics (43 percent) and hit the name number of free throws (20), but Boston ended up getting up eight more shots than Washington thanks to their work on the offensive glass, and that ended up being the difference Monday. It also didn't help that their starting backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal failed to get into a groove offensively, as the two shot a combined 10-of-25 from the field and 3-of-10 from behind the arc en route to scoring a combined 35 points, while they've been averaging a combined 46 points per game this season. In the end, six different Wizards players managed to score in double figures, but it just wasn't enough to get a key road win.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets, 125-124, at Toyota Center on Monday. 

In a battle between two elite offenses, there were 249 combined points in this barn burner. James Harden played the hero role once again, as he hit a fastbreak lay-up with two seconds left to take the lead and eventually win the game. This matchup was close throughout, as there were 10 ties and nine lead changes, with neither team leading by more than seven points in the second half. Both teams were lights-out from the field, as they each shot over 50 percent. Turnovers really killed Denver, as they lost that battle, 19-12. 

The Nuggets (33-37) are trying to hold on to to the eight-seed in the west and this loss is devastating for that pursuit. Gary Harris led Denver, as he scored a career-high 28 points, while also adding four assists and three steals to his tally. Will Barton was huge off the bench, accruing 24 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. Nikola Jokic fell just shy of a triple-double, collecting 22 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. On deck for the Nuggets is a home matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday. 

The Rockets (49-22) have now won three-straight at home and hold a 3-0 record against the Nuggets this season. Harden was the star, as he accumulated 39 points, seven rebounds, 11 assists and four steals including the game-winner. Eric Gordon finished second on the team, providing 18 points and three assists off the bench. Trevor Ariza and Patrick Beverley each totaled 14 points and three assists, while combining for 10 boards. Clint Capela totaled 12 points, nine rebounds and four assists.  Houston will look to keep rolling on Friday against the surging New Orleans Pelicans.

												The visiting Golden State Warriors routed the Oklahoma City Thunder once again on Monday night, 111-95.

Klay Thompson and Steph Curry showed the reason for their ""Splash Brothers"" moniker on Monday, combining for 14 three-pointers as Golden State (56-14) cruised to victory.  Thompson was the high scorer for the Warriors, as he poured in 34 points in just 32 minutes of play time.  Curry, meanwhile, scored 23 and dished out six assists.  Little offensive production was needed outside of the two All-Stars, though the rest of the team still managed to impress on that end.  As a whole, the Dubs shot over 48 percent from the field and recorded a stellar 28 team assists.  

OKC (40-30) came into the game relatively hot but were stopped cold by the powerhouse Warriors.  It was an off night for superstar point guard Russell Westbrook, though for a monster like Westbrook, that term is obviously relative.  Westbrook still managed to fill the stat sheet with 15 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists.  However, he shot a dismal 4-of-16 from the field and turned the ball over five times.  As a team, it was a remarkably poor offensive night for the Thunder.  They made just over 42 percent of their shots and could not hit the deep ball, going just 4-of-21 from beyond the arc.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers defeated the New York Knicks on Monday, 114-105.

Los Angeles (42-29) has now won two games in a row after hitting a bit of a late-season slide after the All-Star break.  Superstar point guard Chris Paul helped lead the team to Monday's victory, as he dished out a team-high 13 assists to go along with 13 points.  On top of Paul, fellow All-Star Blake Griffin had a major scoring burst, delivering a team-high 30 points.  The Clippers led for the strong majority of the game, though the Knicks pulled closer near the close of the fourth quarter.  As a team, LA shot over 49 percent and hit 10 three-pointers on the night while holding the Knicks to just 45 percent and six made threes. 

The Knicks (27-43) appear to have given up on their playoff push as they continue to slide at the end of the season.  While New York lost by only single digits, the team trailed by double figures for almost the entirety of the second half.  Perhaps the team's top performer was sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis, who impressed with a team-high 18 points and 11 rebounds to go along with two steals.  One of the only advantages the Knicks managed to hold in the game was in the rebounding column, where they out-rebounded the Clippers 48-42.  

The Clippers will play the Lakers on Tuesday, while the Knicks will visit Utah on Wednesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 111-104, at Barclays Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Mavericks (30-39) came into Sunday's contest in urgent need of a win, not only to keep pace behind the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference, but to also put the considerable bad taste of a 116-74 loss to the Sixers on Friday behind them. A matchup against the defensively-challenged Brooklyn Nets proved to be what the doctor ordered, as Dallas shot 53.9 percent from the field and used a 57-43 halftime lead as the foundation for the road victory. Dirk Nowitzki and J.J. Barea's 20-point efforts from the starting five and bench, respectively, led the way, and modest but balanced efforts across the rest of the rotation helped the Mavs hold off the feisty Nets (13-56).

Nowitzki contributed a near double-double of 23 points and nine rebounds. Barea was next with 20 points, seven assists, one rebound and two steals. Harrison Barnes tallied 19 points, six rebounds and two assists. Wesley Matthews supplied 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Yogi Ferrell registered eight points, five assists, two rebounds, three steals and a block. Devin Harris was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, two boards, one assist and one steal. 

Brook Lopez paced Brooklyn with a game-high 27 points, which he supplemented with seven boards. Spencer Dinwiddie followed with 18 points, seven dimes, two rebounds and one steal while leading the bench. Randy Foye registered 11 points, six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Quincy Acy matched Foye's point total and added three rebounds. Isaiah Whitehead poured in 10 points and added two boards and two assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest six points but also hauled in nine rebounds and recorded a block.

The Mavericks head back home to face the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday evening, while the Nets remain home to tangle with the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night as well.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Boston Celtics, 105-99, at Wells Fargo Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Celtics (44-26) had come into Sunday just 1.5 games behind the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, with a golden opportunity to make up further ground. They knew they'd have a challenge on their hands, however, as the Sixers (26-43) had been playing much better basketball than their record indicated and they'd also be missing team MVP Isaiah Thomas for a second straight contest with knee soreness. Accordingly, Philadelphia managed to play spoiler effectively, overcoming a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit. Thomas' absence certainly helped the Sixers' cause, but they earned the upset victory by limiting Boston to 40 percent shooting from the field and 20.7 percent from three-point range, while also forcing 17 turnovers.

Al Horford paced the Celtics with 27 points, a total he supplemented with eight boards, six assists, two blocks and one steal. Jae Crowder filled out the stat sheet with 15 points, seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. Terry Rozier was next with a bench-leading 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and one steal. Avery Bradley supplied 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Kelly Olynyk was productive off the bench as well with 12 points, one rebound and one assist. Marcus Smart drew a second straight start in Thomas' stead and chipped in eight points, eight assists, six rebounds and two steals. 

Dario Saric led the Sixers with 23 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals. Robert Covington tallied 16 points, eight rebounds and two steals and drained the go-ahead three-pointer in the fourth period. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot supplied 13 points, two boards and one assist. Jahlil Okafor exited early with knee soreness after 12 minutes, posting four points and one rebound before heading to the bench. A trio of nine-point efforts from Sergio Rodriguez, Gerald Henderson and Nik Stauskas paced the reserves.

The Celtics return home to tangle with the Washington Wizards on Monday evening, while the Sixers head to Central Florida for a Monday night date with the Orlando Magic.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Phoenix Suns, 112-95, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Sunday.

Detroit was expected to win this game easily, but it took a late run for them to prevail. In fact, the Pistons went on a 35-12 run in a 10-minute span between the third and fourth quarters to overcome a 12-point deficit and eventually pull away. The game was relatively close up to that point though, as there were nine lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 12 points until the final five minutes. Phoenix really struggled with their shots, as they went just 35 percent from the field, 27 percent from three-point range and 63 percent from the free-throw line. Rebounding was also key for Detroit, as they won that battle, 63-47.

The Suns (22-48) had a tough task here without Eric Bledsoe and Devin Booker, as they didn't have enough ammunition to match with the Pistons. Tyler Ulis shot just 7-of-24 from the field, but still accrued 17 points, three rebounds, 11 assists and three steals. T.J. Warren finished with 15 points, six rebounds, three steals and two blocks. Alan Williams recorded a double-double off the bench, providing 11 points and 12 rebounds. On deck for Phoenix is a road matchup versus the Miami Heat on Tuesday. 

The Pistons (34-36) are in must-win mode every game out and this one was a bit too close for comfort. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the player of the game, as he collected 23 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Andre Drummond was equally as good, accumulating 18 points, 18 rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Marcus Morris amassed 16 points, five rebounds and three assists. Aron Baynes was huge off the bench, totaling 13 points and 17 rebounds in just 17 minutes of action. Detroit's next game is a favorable one, as they play the Brooklyn Nets on the road on Tuesday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 123-109, at Smoothie King Center on Sunday.

In a battle between two teams looking to keep playoff hopes alive, New Orleans were able to prevail with a gigantic win. They really turned it on in the second half, as they dropped 75 points and outscored Minnesota by 20 to complete the comeback. Rebounding was a huge factor for the Pelicans, as they won that battle, 42-36. New Orleans also took advantage of transition baskets, winning the fastbreak differential, 33-13. 

The Timberwolves (28-41) needed this win to keep their playoff hopes alive, as they now sit 4.5 games behind the eight-seed in the west.

Andrew Wiggins was the only other starter with more than 10 points, as he tallied 25 points, two rebounds, two assists and two steals. Ricky Rubio accrued 10 points, three rebounds and 14 assists. Shabazz Muhammad was huge off the bench, providing 20 points and six rebounds. On deck for Minnesota is a home matchup against the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Indiana Pacers, 116-91, at Air Canada Center on Sunday. 

In this potential playoff preview, Toronto showed just how good they can be in their home building. It was a near wire-to-wire win for the Raptors, as they led for the final 42 minutes. In addition, Toronto held a double-digit lead for the entirety of the second half. Shooting was decisive, with the Raptors hitting 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range. The Pacers shot just 41 percent from the field and 26 percent from long range. Rebounding was a glaring difference as well, with Toronto winning that battle, 51-33.

The Pacers (35-34) have now traded off wins and losses across their last 13 games, as they continue their pursuit for mediocrity. Paul George led the way for Indiana, as he tallied 18 points, four rebounds and two assists. Thaddeus Young finished with 16 points and four rebounds on 7-of-9 shooting. Jeff Teague accrued 16 points and seven assists. Monta Ellis was the only other Pacer in double figures, as he provided 10 points and three assists off the bench. On deck for the Pacers is a home matchup against the Utah Jazz on Monday. 

The Raptors (41-29) have been struggling without Kyle Lowry, but this was a huge win over a conference rival. DeMar DeRozan was the player of the game, as he accumulated 22 points, three rebounds and four assists. Serge Ibaka totaled 16 points and five rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas recorded a double-double, amassing 11 points and 13 rebounds. Cory Joseph started for Lowry and collected 11 points, four rebounds and nine assists. Norman Powell and Jakob Poeltl each scored in double figures off the bench. Toronto will look to build off this win on Tuesday against the Chicago Bulls.

												The visiting Portland Trail Blazers took down the Miami Heat on Sunday, 115-114.

Portland (32-37) is now 8-3 in its last 11 games as it fights for the eighth seed in a still-open Western Conference.  Leading the Blazers to take down the Heat was star point guard Damian Lillard, who dominated throughout with a season-high 49 points.  Lillard went an astounding 14-of-21 from the field, including 9-of-12 from three-point range, and 12-of-12 from the free-throw line.  Trade deadline acquisition Jusuf Nurkic also impressed, scoring 21 points to go along with 12 rebounds, six of which came on the offensive end.  Nurkic also blocked three shots.  All in all, the Blazers appeared to have found their stride as the race for the playoff race has heated up.  

Miami (34-36) has been one of the hottest teams in the league, but fell down to ninth place with the loss to Portland.  Defense was a major problem for the Heat, as they allowed the Blazers to shoot over 50 percent and hit 13-of-26 from three-point range.  While center Hassan Whiteside blocked three shots and had two steals, he had major issues on the defensive end, as he picked up five personal fouls.  Off the bench, the Heat saw the majority of their offensive output.  Sixth man James Johnson poured in a team-high 24 points to go along with seven rebounds and five assists.  

On Tuesday, Miami will host the Suns, while Portland will host the Bucks.

												The host San Antonio Spurs took down the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, 118-102.

San Antonio (53-16) snapped a rare two-game losing streak with a massive blowout win on Sunday. A full team effort was at the heart of the Spurs' blowout success on Sunday. Seven San Antonio players scored in double figures, with veteran big man Pau Gasol leading the way at 22 points.  He added nine rebounds.  As a unit, the Spurs shot over 49 percent from the field and hit 11 three-pointers.  The team also managed 31 assists on the night and held a 45-40 rebounding advantage.  

The Kings (27-43) have now gone 2-9 in their last 11 games.  Sacramento saw a team-high 18 points from both sophomore Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Buddy Hield.  Both added five assists.  The Kings shot over 49 percent from the field, but attempted only ten three-pointers on the night.  Personal fouls were another issue for Sacramento, as the team allowed San Antonio to get to the line 27 times on the night.  On the flip side, the Kings were only sent to the line 17.  The team did a good job shutting down San Antonio superstar Kawhi Leonard, though, holding him to just 3-of-12 shooting and 12 points on the night.  

On Tuesday, the Spurs will visit Minnesota, while the Kings will host the Bucks on Wednesday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 125-120 at Staples Center on Sunday. 

The Cavaliers (46-23) and Lakers (20-50) provided some showtime moments after LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and D'Angelo Russell put on a show at Staples Center. The competitive back-and-forth affair saw the Lakers up 10 points heading into the fourth quarter, but Irving proved too much to handle in crunch time as the Cavaliers dumped 43 fourth quarter points on Los Angeles. Irving knocked down a pair of free throws before hitting the step-back go ahead three pointer to extend a three point lead for Cleveland. LeBron James aided the close out for Cleveland throughout the leftover 4:00 minutes of action. 

Irving finished with a game high 46 points, to go with three assists and two rebounds on 15-of-21 shooting. James added 34 points, six boards and seven assists, while Kevin Love posted a double-double with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Cleveland opted to go four players deep on the bench, with both Richard Jefferson and J.R. Smith seeing 27-plus minutes of play. Smith was unable to knock down a three-pointer in the contest where he finished 0-of-5 from deep. 

D'Angelo Russell scored 40 points, which marks a career high, and added six assists and two rebounds. All five Lakers starters finished in double figures scoring, with Jordan Clarkson leading the remainders with 19 points, while Julius Randle pitched in 10 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. 

Next up, the Lakers host the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, while the Cavaliers visit the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Sacramento Kings, 110-94, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday afternoon.

Afternoon matinees seem to agree with the Thunder (40-29), who notched their second consecutive early Saturday win by dominating the Kings (27-42) to the tune of a 63-41 first-half lead. That allowed them to essentially cruise in the second half and provide plenty of playing time to recent acquisition Doug McDermott off the bench, who enjoyed his best game since arriving in OKC. Russell Westbrook led the way as usual for the Thunder with 28 points, 10 assists, eight rebounds and four steals. Oklahoma City also imposed their will down low, as they outrebounded their visitors by a 49-35 margin. 

The Kings bench enjoyed a more productive day than the starting five, as they combined for 53 points. Georgios Papagiannis, recently recalled from the D-League, led the way with 14 points, 11 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Skal Labissiere continued his recent stretch of strong play with 13 points, four rebounds and one assist. Buddy Hield led the first unit with a modest 11 points that he supplemented with a rebound and a steal. Darren Collison provided 10 points and three boards.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 113-97, at Phillips Arena on Saturday evening.

The Trail Blazers (31-37) checked into Saturday's contest with victories in six of their previous eight games, but facing a tough test against an Eastern Conference playoff hopeful in the Hawks (37-32). Portland was more than up for the challenge, ambushing their hosts by outscoring them 40-18 in the first quarter.They maximized their scoring opportunities overall, with all five starters posting double-digit scoring, and success rates of 50.6 percent from the field, 44.4 percent from three-point range and 89.7 percent from the free-throw line. A combination of that hot hand offensively and solid play on the other end of the floor helped them overcome 20 turnovers.

Damian Lillard led the way with 27 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, five assists and two steals. C.J. McCollum was next with 22 points, six rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal. Allen Crabbe followed with a bench-leading 16 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds and two steals. Jusuf Nurkic went for 12 points, nine boards, six assists, five blocks and two steals. Maurice Harkless matched Nurkic's point total and added four boards, four assists, two steals and one block. Noah Vonleh rounded out the first unit's successful evening with 10 points and 11 rebounds. 

Ersan Ilyasova drew a start for Paul Millsap (knee) and provided a team-high 23 points, along with four rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Tim Hardaway, Jr. followed with a bench-leading 22 points, as well as two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Dwight Howard posted a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists, five steals and one block. Kent Bazemore compiled 12 points, two assists and a block. Thabo Sefolosha was notably held scoreless over 19 minutes.

The Trail Blazers continue on a southern trajectory, with their next stop in South Florida on Sunday evening to take on the Miami Heat. The Hawks head to Charlotte for a Monday night date with the Hornets.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Washington Wizards, 98-93, at Spectrum Center on Saturday night.

The Wizards (42-27) checked into Saturday having played very well over their past two weeks, but also burning the proverbial candle at both ends. Washington had already played 13 games since the All-Star break, and hadn't enjoyed two consecutive days off since just before the extended layoff. That pace was bound to catch up with them at some point, and it may have well been Saturday night. The Wizards appeared a bit sluggish on offense, with their final scoring tally representing their lowest since Feb. 26. They shot just 36.7 percent from the field and 33.3 percent from three-point range while also turning the ball over 12 times. The Hornets (30-39) were able to capitalize on their visitors' fatigue in the second half, when they outscored the Wizards by a 59-53 margin to pull off the home victory.

John Wall led Washington with a modest 19 points, which he supplemented with eight assists, three rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Bradley Beal was next with 18 points, three boards, two assists, one steal and one block. Otto Porter, Jr. followed with 16 points, three rebounds, one assist and three steals. Jason Smith drew another start for Markieff Morris (illness) and provided eight points, four rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Bojan Bogdanovic led the bench with 12 points, three rebounds and one assist.

Cody Zeller paced Charlotte with 19 points, five rebounds, four steals and two blocks. Kemba Walker and Marvin Williams supplied matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding six assists and two rebounds and the latter registering eight rebounds, three assists and two steals. Nicolas Batum returned after a multi-game absence due to migraines and tallied eight points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Frank Kaminsky III paced the reserves with 14 points, four boards, two assists and one block. Marco Belinelli was productive off the bench as well with 11 points, two assists and one rebound.

The Wizards next head to Boston for key showdown with the Celtics on Monday night, while the Hornets remain home to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday evening as well.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers, 108-78, at Staples Center on Saturday evening. 

The Cavaliers decided to rest their big-three, as LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love all rode the benches, while their team floundered in one of the most lackluster performances of the season. The Cavs actually led 16-14 after the first quarter, but the Clippers woke up and dominated the second quarter, to take a 47-31 lead into half time. The Clippers shot 51.3 percent from the field and dished 27 assists, as they cruised to the win, ending a three-game losing streak. 

Richard Jefferson was the high-point man for Cleveland (45-23) with 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting, to go along with six rebounds, in 28 minutes off the bench. Six other players scored in double digits for the Cavs, including Channing Frye, J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert and DeAndre Liggins, who chipped in 10 points each. The Cavs will look to get back on track, and will likely have their stars back in action, as they face the second game of a back-to-back on Sunday in Los Angeles, this time against the Lakers. 

Meanwhile, Blake Griffin poured in 23 points on 10-of-17 shooting, to go along with eight rebounds and four assists, in 31 minutes, to lead the Clippers (41-29) to a much-needed win. DeAndre Jordan took care of the paint, gobbling up 17 rebounds, to compliment his 13 points, two assists and one steal, while J.J. Redick shot 6-of-11 from the field on his way to 16 points in only 19 minutes. The Clippers will look to build a winning streak, as they play host to the struggling Knicks on Monday.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the visiting Utah Jazz, 95-86, at United Center on Saturday evening. 

The Jazz led by 12 late in the first quarter but the Bulls battled back to make it a four-point game by halftime. Chicago came out strong in the second half, taking the lead three minutes into the third quarter. The game remained close until the final three minutes, where the Bulls closed the game on a 10-3 run. 

After losing two straight, Chicago (32-37) got a much-needed win, as Jimmy Butler led the way 23 points, seven assists, four rebounds, three steals and two blocks, in 38 minutes. The Bulls got a serious boost from a couple of youngsters, as Bobby Portis poured in a career-high 22 points on 10-of-13 shooting, to go along with five rebounds, in 31 minutes off the bench; and Denzel Valentine notched his first career double-double, with 11 points and 12 rebounds, in 28 minutes off the bench. The Bulls will need everything they can get down the stretch, in order to keep their playoff hopes alive. They look ahead to Tuesday, when they take on the Raptors in Toronto.

Meanwhile, the Jazz (43-27) shot only 38.3 percent from the field and 28.0 percent from long range, as they struggled to stay composed down the stretch. Five players scored in double digits for Utah, led by George Hill, who finished with 18 points, seven rebounds and four assists, in 37 minutes. Gordon Hayward followed up with 14 points, six rebounds, four steals and two assists, while Rudy Gobert double-doubled with 13 points, 13 rebounds, five blocks and two assists, before fouling out in the final minutes.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 104-96, at FedEx Forum on Saturday.

In this potential playoff preview, Memphis showed San Antonio just how hard it is to win in FedEx Forum. The first 26 minutes were tight, as there were six ties and 15 lead changes in total. The Grizzlies took control from there, as they led for the final 22 minutes. Three-point shooting was the only true advantage for Memphis, as they went 13-of-30 from long range, while San Antonio struggled at 9-of-28. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with Memphis recording two more assists than San Antonio, while committing five less turnovers. 

The Spurs (52-16) had a tough task here against a hot Grizzlies team, as they simply didn't have enough in the arsenal to win this game. Kawhi Leonard led the way, as he tallied 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists. LaMarcus Aldridge was the only other starter with more than four points, as he finished with 21 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Jonathan Simmons was a nice spark off the bench, dropping 14 points in 17 minutes. On deck for San Antonio is a home matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.

The Grizzlies (40-30) have extended their winning streak to four games, with this win being the most impressive of the bunch. Mike Conley was the player of the game, as he collected 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Marc Gasol totaled 16 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Zach Randolph was huge off the bench, providing 18 points and seven rebounds. The Grizzlies are off until Tuesday, when they take on the New Orleans Pelicans on the road.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets, 109-105, at Pepsi Center on Saturday. 

There have been some lopsided matchups between these teams recently, but this one was incredibly close. In fact, there were 16 ties and 11 lead changes, with neither team capturing a double-digit lead. Houston really took control in the second half, as they led for the final 18 minutes, thanks to a 29-18 third quarter. Free-throw shooting was a huge advantage for the Rockets, as they went 28-of-35, while the Nuggets hit just 19-of-30. Houston also dominated down low, winning the scoring in the paint battle, 60-48. 

The Rockets (48-22) now have four wins in their last five games, as they continue to add impressive wins in their resume'. James Harden carried the load, as he collected 40 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists en route to another triple-double. Clint Capela finished second on the team, totaling 16 points and eight rebounds. Nene Hilario was a nice spark off the bench, providing 14 points and seven rebounds.

The Nuggets (33-36) had won four-straight headed into this game, but this was a disappointing loss at home. Jameer Nelson was Denver's best player, as he accrued 15 points, seven rebounds and 11 assists. Nikola Jokic amassed 16 points, five rebounds and four assists. Gary Harris totaled 17 points and six rebounds. Will Barton, Jamal Murray and Kenneth Faried were the only bench players to feature and they all scored in double figures. 

These two teams next game will be a rematch on Monday back in Houston.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 117-92, at Oracle Arena on Saturday. 

Golden State were expected to win this game easily and they left no doubt with this 25-point result. The second quarter is where they separated themselves from Milwaukee, as they won that quarter, 36-15. Golden State actually led by at least 18 points for the entirety of the second half, thanks to that run. The shooting statistics were lopsided, with Golden State hitting 60 percent of their shots to Milwaukee's 40 percent. Defensive rebounding really helped the Warriors too, as they outrebounded the Bucks, 38-23.

The Bucks (34-35) had won eight of nine headed into this matchup, but facing the Warriors is a different animal. Michael Brogdon led the team with 18 points, four rebounds and three assists. Khris Middleton totaled just 11 points and five assists, Greg Monroe led the bench with 12 points and seven rebounds. Giannis Antetokounmpo had one of his worst games of the season, collecting just nine points, three rebounds and three assists. Milwaukee's next game won't be until Tuesday, when they take on the Portland Trail Blazers on the road.

The Warriors (55-14) have extended their winning streak to three games with this victory, as they appear to be getting back on track. Stephen Curry led Golden State, as he accrued 28 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals. Klay Thompson finished second on the team, dropping 21 points. Draymond Green flirted with a triple-double, accumulating eight points, eight rebounds and 10 assists. Andre Iguodala was a huge spark off the bench, providing 15 points, four rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Golden State's next game will be on Monday, when they face the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 116-74, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday night.

The Sixers (25-43) have been rightfully lauded for their considerable improvement this season, which has persisted even after the season-ending knee injury to star center Joel Embiid. Philadelphia's ongoing transformation to a winning team has not been as evident all season as it was Friday, when they thoroughly dominated a team that still has postseason aspirations in the Mavericks (29-39). Only one member of the Dallas starting five managed to post double-digit scoring, and just barely, as Dirk Nowitzki tallied just 10 points. The Mavs also managed to shoot just 34.5 percent from the field and 21.7 percent from three-point range. However, the most eye-opening -- and perhaps team-defining -- aspect of the contest was the Sixers' response to a first-quarter 23-21 deficit. The Sixers ripped off 66 points over the second and third quarters while limiting their visitors to exactly half that total, allowing them to cruise the rest of the way for their most lopsided victory of the season.

Dwight Powell actually led the Mavs off the bench with 14 points, which he supplemented with one assist. J.J. Barea followed with 11 points, four assists and one rebound in 17 minutes. Nowitzki added a rebound and a block to his aforementioned scoring total. The rest of the first unit was frustrated throughout the night, with Seth Curry the next highest scorer with seven points, to which he added a rebound and an assist. Harrison Barnes and Yogi Ferrell were able to only contribute matching four-point efforts.

Justin Anderson paced the Sixers off the bench with a career-high 19 points, eight rebounds, three assists and one steal. Robert Covington totaled 18 points, nine rebounds, three assists and one block. Richaun Holmes parlayed a start into 17 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Sergio Rodriguez tallied 13 points, six assists and four rebounds on the second unit. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, another of several promising young Sixers players keying their current resurgence, supplied 12 points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal. Dario Saric was actually a secondary contributor on the night but still provided a full stat line of 10 points, seven rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. Jahlil  Okafor was productive as a reserve as well with 10 points, three rebounds, one assist and one block.

The Mavericks head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets on Sunday afternoon, while the Sixers remain home to tangle with the Celtics on Sunday afternoon as well.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Chicago Bulls, 112-107, at Verizon Center on Friday.

Despite the final scoreline being close, Washington was in control for the majority of this game. In fact, they held the lead for the final 44 minutes, with that margin getting up to 19 points at times in the third quarter. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the decisive statistic, with Washington recording six more assists than Chicago, while committing nine less turnovers. The Bulls were really let down by their shots, hitting 26 percent of their three's and 67 percent of their free-throws. 

The Bulls (32-37) have now lost seven of their last eight games, as they continue to fall deeper out of the playoffs. Jimmy Butler led the way for Chicago, as he collected 28 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 98-95, at Barclays Center on Friday evening. 

The Celtics led 45-37 after a low-scoring first half but the Nets came out strong in the second half and were able to gain the lead for a few minutes in the fourth. The Celtics quickly took the advantage once more, leading by eight with 2:09 left in the game. However, the Celtics would not get away easy, as the Nets brought it back to a one-possession game, with a chance to inbound the ball with nine seconds remaining. They got two three-point attempts within that final nine seconds that could have tied it up, yet thankfully for Boston, neither of them fell, allowing the Celtics to escape with the win.

Five players scored in double digits for the Celtics (44-25), led by Jae Crowder, who double-doubled with 24 points and 12 rebounds, in 35 minutes. Avery Bradley followed up with 16 points and five rebounds, while Al Horford chipped in 12 points, eight rebounds, four assists, four blocks and one steal. The Celtics were without their all star, Isaiah Thomas (knee), but Marcus Smart stepped in to run the point, contributing 12 points, five assists, three rebounds and three steals. The Celtics look ahead to their next contest on Sunday in Philadelphia. 

Meanwhile, Brook Lopez led the way for the Nets (13-55) with 23 points on 8-of-18 shooting, to go along with five rebounds, four assists and two blocks, in 31 minutes. Five other players scored in double digits for Brooklyn, including Randy Foye, who added 14 points and Andrew Nicholson, who chipped in 11 off the bench. The Nets go on to host the Mavericks on Sunday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Detroit Pistons, 87-75, at Palace at Auburn Hills on Friday. 

Both teams' defenses came out ultra-sharp, with only a combined 29 points scored in the first quarter. The game remained close throughout the second and third periods as well, and the Pistons (33-36) actually entered the fourth quarter with a 66-60 lead. That's when the light went on for the Raptors (40-29), who rattled off 27 points over the final 12 minutes while limiting Detroit to just nine points. Abysmal three-point shooting was part of the downfall for the Pistons, as they managed just a 15 percent success rate from behind the arc. The loss negated a mammoth 22-rebound effort from Detroit's Andre Drummond.

Serge Ibaka paced Toronto with 17 points, nine rebounds and one assist. DeMar DeRozan followed with 14 points, eight boards and six assists. DeMarre Carroll supplied 12 points, one rebound, one assist and one steal. Jonas Valanciunas chipped in with 10 points, eight rebounds, one steal and one block. Cory Joseph was productive as well with a full stat line of nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and one block. Norman Powell led the second unit with 11 points and two rebounds.

Reggie Jackson led Detroit with 20 points and six assists. Tobias Harris provided 14 points, seven rebounds and one steal. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope registered nine points, two rebounds and two assists. Andre Drummond added eight points, two steals and one block in addition to his astounding rebound total. Jon Leuer led the second unit with 12 points, five rebounds, two assists and one block. 

The Raptors head back home to tangle with the Indiana Pacers on Sunday evening, while the Pistons remain home to face off with the Phoenix Suns on Sunday afternoon.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Houston Rockets, 128-112, at Smoothie King Center on Friday. 

Houston was expected to win this game easily, but New Orleans had other ideas. The Pelicans came out early, as they took a 36-23 leas after the first quarter and never relinquished the lead from there. In fact, New Orleans held a double-digit lead for the the final three quarters. Shooting was key, as the Pelicans hit 53 percent of their shots, while holding the Rockets to just 42 percent from the field. They also dominated the assist margin, winning that, 29-18. In addition, New Orleans ended up destroying the fastbreak differential and points in the paint margins, combining to win those statistics, 85-60. 

The Pelicans (28-41) are now 2-0 without DeMarcus Cousins since acquiring him, as he missed this game with rib and knee issues. Solomon Hill was the star, as he accumulated 30 points, six rebounds, seven assists and three steals in this win. Anthony Davis finished with 24 points, 15 rebounds, three assists and two steals. Jrue Holiday collected 19 points, three rebounds, six assists and two blocks. Tim Frazier was a nice spark off the bench, providing 14 points, five rebounds and six assists. New Orleans will host the Minnesota Timberwolves for their next game on Sunday. 

The Rockets (47-22) snapped a three-game winning streak with this defeat, but it was no fault of James Harden. The MVP candidate finished with 41 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. No other starter scored in double figures, as the other four combined for just one assist, while going 11-of-35 from the field. Lou Williams led the bench with 14 points and Eric Gordon dropped 12 points. Houston will look to play better on Saturday in a road matchup against the Denver Nuggets.

												The Miami Heat defeated the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 123-105, at American Airlines Arena on Friday evening. 

The Heat owned a significant 64-49 lead at halftime, however the Timberwolves came back with a 32-point third quarter to cut the deficit to nine heading into the fourth. The Heat got right back to business in the fourth though, led by Goran Dragic, who poured in 12 points in the quarter, to help seal the win and keep Miami's playoff hopes alive. Unfortunately for Miami, Dion Waiters was forced to leave the game in the second quarter after rolling his ankle.

The Heat (34-35) dished 29 assists and shot a blistering 58.8 percent from the field, to earn their 20th home win of the season. Hassan Whiteside led the way for Miami with 23 points on 10-of-11 shooting and 14 rebounds, in 33 minutes. Tyler Johnson also poured in 23 points, while James Johnson chipped in 17 points, as they continued to provide the Heat with a huge spark off the bench. Goran Dragic added 19 points and dished 10 assists, in 33 minutes of action. With the Pistons and the Bulls both taking loses on Friday night, this win is extremely valuable for Miami's playoff aspirations, as it puts them one game ahead of the ninth-place Pistons and two games ahead of the tenth-place Bulls. The Heat will look to continue their effort, as they play host to the Trail Blazers on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves (28-40) with 31 points and 11 rebounds, while Andrew Wiggins followed up with 26 points and Ricky Rubio added 20.

Vucevic's monster contribution was necessary, as Orlando actually lost the team battle on the boards, 49-43.  The Magic were able to squeak by with the win, though, on the basis of a superior three-point shooting night.  Despite sinking only seven threes of their own, Orlando's perimeter defense was stifling, holding Phoenix to just 2-of-14 from three-point range.  Orlando's Evan Fournier led the effort for the Magic from beyond the arc, as he sank three three-pointers on the night.  

Phoenix (22-47) has had a rough time this season, and recently shut down veteran point guard Eric Bledsoe for the season to increase the role of its young players. On Friday, that strategy seemed to work, as rookie point guard Tyler Ulis went for 19 points and eight assists in a starting role.  Third-year forward T.J. Warren also continued his strong production.  Warren shot 8-of-13 and went 10-of-10 from the free-throw line en route to a team-high 26 points.  However, the two youngsters were not enough to propel Orlando to victory.  

The Suns will visit Detroit on Sunday, while the Magic host the 76ers on Monday.

												The host Milwaukee Bucks took down the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, 107-103.

Milwaukee (34-34) broke even in the win and loss columns with Friday's victory.   The star duo of wings, Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo, combined for 56 points on the night, more than half of Milwaukee's offensive output.  Antetokounmpo added eight rebounds, five assists, and two blocks on the night.  Middleton, meanwhile, was 11-of-18 from the field and 8-of-9 from the free-throw line.   It was an impressive defensive night for the Bucks, as the team blocked nine shots in total.  

Los Angeles (20-49) continues to remain near the bottom of the league in terms of record.  The team recently shut down veteran center Timofey Mozgov in order to give more play time to its young players.  Julius Randle, the third-year forward, scored four points to go with 12 rebounds and eight assists in what was a nice night for the young star.  As a team, LA functioned very well, as they dished out 24 assists on the night.  They shot over 45 percent and made 11 three-pointers as well.  

The Bucks move up the coast to play at the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. The Lakers next play Sunday vs. the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Utah Jazz, 91-83, at Quicken Loans Arena on Thursday night.

The Cavaliers (45-22) came into Thursday fairly desperate for a win, as they'd dropped four of six games and had the Boston Celtics nipping at their heels, only two games behind for the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Despite being faced with essentially the toughest defense in the NBA in the Jazz (43-26) and losing Kyrie Irving (knee tightness) and Iman Shumpert (shoulder) within the game, Cleveland overcame the tough odds to prevail on the strength of a LeBron James 33-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included six assists, two steals and one block. The Cavs also saw the return of Kevin Love (knee) to the starting lineup after missing 13 games, which helped offset the aforementioned in-game exits. Defense was a key as well, as Utah committed 16 turnovers and shot just 23.8 percent from long distance.

The Jazz were led by Rudy Gobert's 20-point, 19-rebound double-double that also included one assist, two steals and two blocks. Gordon Hayward followed with 13 points, five rebounds, four assists and one steal. Joe Johnson and Joe Ingles turned in matching 12-point efforts, with the former adding four rebounds, three assists and one steal, and the latter supplying four rebounds, four assists and one steal. George Hill turned in a modest effort of nine points, two rebounds, two assists and one steal.

Irving followed James with 21 points, four rebounds and four assists over 30 minutes before departing. Love posted 10 points and nine rebounds over 20 minutes. Shumpert had nine points and three rebounds in 22 minutes before his exit, and J.R. Smith, getting extra run due to Shumpert's early shower, led the bench with 12 points, six boards and one steal.

The Jazz head to the Windy City to take on the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night, while the Cavaliers are West Coast-bound for a Saturday evening showdown of their own with the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Toronto Raptors, 123-102, at Air Canada Center on Thursday. 

It's rare to see Toronto dominated in its home building, but that was just the case here. In fact, this was a wire-to-wire win for Oklahoma City, as they led by at least 19 points for the entirety of the fourth quarter. Shooting was key, with the Thunder shooting 53 percent from the field and 56 percent from three-point range. The Raptors could only muster up 46 percent from the field and 26 percent from three-point range. Rebounding was decisive as well, with Oklahoma City winning that battle, 47-32. The 33 assists recorded by the Thunder dominated the 15 dished out by Toronto too.

The Thunder (39-29) have now won four-straight games, as they continue to ride Russell Westbrook's heavy shoulders. Westbrook picked up his 34th triple-double of the season in this win, as he collected 24 points, 10 rebounds and 16 assists. Victor Oladipo was just behind Westbrook, totaling 23 points, five rebounds and two assists. Enes Kanter was a huge spark off the bench, providing 14 points and seven rebounds. Taj Gibson, Alex Abrines and Steven Adams each scored 10 points a piece. On deck for the Thunder is a home matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Saturday.

The Raptors (39-29) continue to struggle without Kyle Lowry and home losses like this show just how much his absence hurts this team. DeMar DeRozan carried the load. as he tallied 22 points, three rebounds and three assists. Cory Joseph accrued 11 points, six assists and two steals. Norman Powell finished second on the team in scoring, dropping 13 points and four rebounds off the bench.  Toronto will be in action again on Friday, as they play the Detroit Pistons on the road for their next game.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the New York Knicks, 121-110, at Madison Square Garden on Thursday evening.

The Nets (13-54) have been the NBA's worst team, and have especially struggled on the road. Coming into Thursday, they'd won only four times in 33 games away from Barclays Center, but their prospects weren't as grim as usual against the Knicks (27-42), which they had already defeated 120-112 just five days prior. Brooklyn proved to once again have New York's number, as all five members of their first unit hit double digits in the scoring column, and the Nets shot a collective 48.2 percent from the floor. The Knicks were also notably without Kristaps Porzingis (thigh), which left them devoid of their best rim protector and shot blocker. The visitors earned the victory in the second half, during which they outscored their hosts by a 67-49 margin.

Brook Lopez led the way for Brooklyn with 24 points, six rebounds, three assists and one block. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson posted 20 points, 10 rebounds and one block. Jeremy Lin supplied another full stat line of 15 points, eight assists, four rebounds and two steals. Rookie Caris LaVert continued to offer strong production, compiling 13 points and seven rebounds. Randy Foye submitted 10 points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal. K.J. McDaniels and Quincy Acy provided matching nine-point efforts to lead the bench.

Kyle O'Quinn checked in as the leading scorer for the Knicks with 23 points, eight rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block in 26 minutes off the bench. Derrick Rose led the starting five with 22 points, two rebounds and two assists. Carmelo Anthony posted 17 points, six rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. Lance Thomas was outstanding in filling in for Porzingis, as he registered a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one assist. Willy Hernangomez ran into early foul trouble and it besieged him throughout the game, as he played only 19 minutes, which facilitated O'Quinn's extended opportunity.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Atlanta Hawks, 103-91, at Philips Arena on Thursday.

While this game was tight throughout the first half, Atlanta really made their mark in the second half. In fact, they outscored the Hawks, 48-39, across the final two quarters. Defense was key for the Grizzlies, as they held the Hawks to 40 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. Rebounding was a decisive statistic as well, with Memphis winning that battle, 48-38. The Grizzlies also dominated the assist ratio, recording 28 assists to Atlanta's 18.

The Grizzlies (39-30) have now won three-straight games, as they appear to be out of the slump that ailed them just last week. Marc Gasol picked up a rare triple-double, as he collected 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Mike Conley led the team in scoring, as he accrued 22 points, four rebounds and 12 assists. JaMychal Green recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points, 12 rebounds, two steals and two blocks. On deck for Memphis is a home matchup against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.

The Hawks (37-31) are rarely dominated in their home building, but playing this rough Memphis team is a serious task. Tim Hardaway Jr' led the team in scoring, as he provided 18 points, four rebounds and three assists off the bench. Kent Bazemore led the starters, as he dropped 16 points. Dwight Howard recorded a double-double, amassing 10 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks. Taurean Prince also played well off the bench, producing 16 points, six rebounds and four blocks. Atlanta will look to play better on Saturday in a home matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers.

												The host Denver Nuggets blew out the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, 129-114.

Denver (33-35) saw strong play on the back of phenomenal sophomore center Nikola Jokic.  Jokic posted a triple-double, recording 17 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists. While Jokic stuffed the stat sheet out of the low post, wing Will Barton dominated the perimeter.  Barton scored a game-high 35 points including seven made three-pointers.  It was an up-tempo and dominant game for the Nuggets' offense, as the team sank over 53 percent of its shots including 15 three-pointers.  The team also went a stellar 22-of-26 from beyond the arc.  Denver dished out 31 team assists and turned the ball over only 10 times on the night. 

Los Angeles (40-28) has dropped three straight games and sits amid a tight playoff race at the middle of the Western Conference.  On Thursday, superstar Chris Paul bounced back from a disaster of a night on Wednesday to record 18 points and 14 assists.  However, fellow All-Stars Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan sat the game out for rest.  The Clippers' offense was hardly stagnant in the duo's absence, however, as the team shot over 50 percent from the field and hit 16 three-pointers.  Their defense, though, failed to keep up with the ridiculous pace of the Nuggets' high-powered offense.  

Los Angeles will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday, while Denver will host the Houston Rockets.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Orlando Magic 122-92 at Oracle Arena on Thursday. 

The Warriors (53-14) bounced back with two straight wins following a three game skid with a rout of the Magic (24-45) on Thursday, led by Klay Thompson's hot hand, where he scored 27 points in the first half. Golden State started off on a 21-7 run and carried a 20-points lead into the second quarter. Orlando had no answer for the 57.5 percent shooting effort put for by the Warriors, and when Thompson cooled off considerably in the second half, Stephen Curry picked right up and started to rack up some points of his own. 

Thompson finished with 29 points, five assists and four rebounds on 12-of-20 shooting, including five three pointers. Curry went on to finish with 25 points, nine assists, one board and three steals, including a highlight reel nutmeg pass to Zaza Pachulia for an exclamation point during the game. Pachulia completed a double-double to the tune of 10 points and 10 rebounds, while Draymond Green rounded out the box score with nine points, 11 rebounds and six assists across 25 minutes. 

Orlando toyed with a handful of different rotations with 10 players playing at least 17 minutes in the loss. Elfrid Payton led all Magic scorers with 13 points, while Evan Fournier's 12 points and Nikola Vucevic's 10 points were no match for the starters of the Warriors. Jeff Green was the strongest bench player, and added 13 points and four rebounds on 6-of-9 shooting across 18 minutes. The Magic shot just 37.2 percent from the field and 25.9 percent from behind the arc. 

Next up, the Magic play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Phoenix Suns on Friday, while the Warriors host the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Washington Wizards, 112-107, at Verizon Center on Wednesday night.

The Mavericks (29-38) came into Wednesday's contest with only eight victories over 39 road contests this season, while the Wizards (41-26) had prevailed in 26 of their 35 home games. As the old adage goes, ""that's why they play the games."" Dallas overcame an early 39-32 first-quarter deficit to stay close through the next two quarters before outscoring Washington by a 39-27 margin in the final 12 minutes. The Mavs did it with stellar shooting, as they tallied a 50.6 percent success rate from the field and 43.8 percent mark from three-point range. Their effort was just enough to overcome those of the dynamic duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal, who combined for 50 of the Wizards' 107 points.

Harrison Barnes led the way for the Mavs with a near-double-double of 22 points, nine rebounds and two assists. Dirk Nowitzki was close behind him with 20 points, four rebounds and two assists. Seth Curry pitched in with 19 points, one assist and two steals. Nerlens Noel led the bench with 12 points, three rebounds, one assist and one block. Nicolas Brussino stepped up with 11 points, nine boards and two steals in 23 minutes, while Devin Harris was also productive as a reserve with 10 points, one rebound, one assist and one steal. 

Wall paced the Wizards with 26 points, which he supplemented with 11 assists, one rebound and three steals. Beal was right behind him with 24 points, five dimes and a pair of boards. Bojan Bogdanovic continued his stellar work off the bench with 19 points, three rebounds and one assist. Otto Porter, Jr. posted a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included five assists. Marcin Gortat mustered a modest eight points but did haul in 10 rebounds.

The Mavericks next head to Philadelphia where they'll take on the Sixers in a Friday night showdown, while the Wizards remain home to tangle with the Chicago Bulls on Friday evening as well.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 98-77, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday.

Indiana were expected to win this game easily and they left no doubt with this 21-point margin. The third quarter is where Indiana really made their mark, outscoring Charlotte, 33-16. The Pacers played some elite defense too, as they held the Hornets to 40 percent from the field and 13 percent from three-point range (3-of-23). Indiana shot 53 percent from the field and 43 percent from long range. Rebounding was also decisive, with the Pacers winning that battle, 42-30. 

The Hornets (29-39) had to play this game without Nicolas Batum (migraine) and they simply aren't the same team without him. Amazingly, no starter scored more than 10 points, as Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was the only starter above 37 percent shooting, as he finished with 10 points to lead the starting-five. Kemba Walker accumulated just seven points and four assists on 3-of-11 from the field. Frank Kaminsky led the team in scoring off the bench, as he totaled 20 points and four rebounds.  Charlotte's next game will be on Wednesday, when they take on the Washington Wizards at home.

The Pacers (35-33) have been a different team at home this season and this sort of win shows why they are so scary in their home building. Paul George was the player of the game, as he collected 39 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals on 15-of-21 shooting. Jeff Teague flirted with a triple-double, as he accrued eight points, eight rebounds and 11 assists. Myles Turner amassed six points, 11 rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks. Monta Ellis was a nice spark off the bench, producing 16 points, two assists and two blocks. Indiana won't play again until Sunday, when they play the Toronto Raptors on the road for their next game.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 117-104, at TD Garden on Wednesday night. 

The Timberwolves (28-39) came into Wednesday's contest running hot and with their Big Three of Ricky Rubio, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins particularly playing well. Minnesota's 75 percent win ratio over their previous four games had vaulted them to just 3.5 games behind eighth-seeded Denver coming into play against the Celtics (43-25), but Boston poured some cold water on their quest for one night. Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford stepped up to counter another strong set of performances from the T-Wolves' aforementioned superstar trio and the Celtics were able to shoot an outstanding 54.4 percent overall while limiting their visitors to a 29.6 percent success rate from behind the arc. Boston created some distance by outscoring Minnesota by a 27-17 margin in the third quarter before sealing the deal with an impressive 32-point fourth period.

Rubio continued a recent stretch of strong offensive play by leading the T-Wolves with 23 points on 8-of-14 shooting, and he added seven assists, three rebounds and one steal. Wiggins followed with 21 points, four boards and four assists. Shabazz Muhammad matched Wiggins' point total while leading the bench and supplemented it with three boards, one assist and one block. Towns posted a 17-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included four assists. Gorgui Dieng registered a near-double-double of eight points, nine rebounds and four assists.

Thomas paced the Celtics with 27 points, along with four assists, three rebounds and one steal. Horford followed with a full line of 20 points, nine boards, eight assists and two blocks. Avery Bradley poured in 18 points and added four assists and three rebounds. Kelly Olynyk and Marcus Smart paced the bench with matching 10-point efforts, with the former also managing three assists and one rebound and the latter dishing out six dimes and hauling in a pair of boards.

The Timberwolves continue heading south and face off with the Miami Heat on Friday night, while the Celtics visit the Brooklyn Nets on Friday evening as well.

												The Miami Heat defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 120-112, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday.

Despite the Heat leading for nearly the entirety of this game, this fixture was closer than it looks. In fact, there were eight ties and six lead changes in total, with a double-digit lead being held for just four of the 48 minutes. Rebounding was decisive, with Miami winning that battle, 45-38. Free-throw shooting was also key, with the Heat shooting 84 percent to New Orleans 68 percent. 

The Pelicans (27-41) continue to search for their rhythm with DeMarcus Cousins now in the fold, as they have just three wins in 10 games with him in the lineup. Cousins played well here though, finishing with 19 points, nine rebounds and two steals. Anthony Davis led the team, as he collected 27 points, eight rebounds, three steals and three blocks. Jrue Holiday amassed 11 points, four rebounds and eight assists. E'Twaun Moore came off the bench to provide 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting. On deck for New Orleans is a home matchup against the Houston Rockets on Friday. 

The Heat (33-35) have now won five of their last six games, with this win giving them a tie for the eight-seed in the east. Goran Dragic returned from his eye injury to lead Miami with 33 points and five rebounds on 11-of-18 shooting. Hassan Whiteside totaled 10 points and 17 rebounds on 9-of-11 from the field. Wayne Ellington led the bench with 19 points, while Tyler Johnson and James Johnson combined for 20 points, seven rebounds, 13 assists and three steals off the pine as well. Miami will look to keep rolling on Friday in a home matchup versus the Minnesota Timberwolves.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Detroit Pistons, 97-83, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, on Wednesday evening. 

The Jazz (43-25) took command right from the start, with a 28-19 first quarter, followed up by a similarly dominant 26-16 second quarter. The Pistons (33-35) were looking flat on the second night of a back-to-back, after being trampled by the Cavaliers on Tuesday evening. The Pistons out-scored the Jazz 48-43 in the second half, but it was too little, too late, as they were dealt their second straight loss. 

Gordon Hayward led the way for Utah, with 25 points on 9-of-17 shooting, to go along with nine rebounds, six assists and one steal, in 34 minutes. Four other players scored in double digits for the Jazz, including George Hill, who added 17, and Joe Ingles, who chipped in 12 points on 4-of-6 shooting, including 4-of-5 from long range, in 27 minutes off the bench. This marks the second straight win for the Jazz, who look to maintain their hold on fourth place in the West. They will face the second night of a back-to-back in their next contest, as they take on the Cavs in Cleveland on Thursday. 

Meanwhile, the Pistons had a tough night from the field, shooting 41.9 percent, including only 3-of-13 from long range. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the only starter to score in double digits for Detroit, with 10 points on lousy 4-of-12 shooting. Ish Smith was the Pistons' high-point man with 16 on 6-of-9 shooting, in 28 minutes off the bench, while Tobias Harris and Aron Baynes chipped in 12 points each. This marked the Pistons second straight loss. They will need to turn things around as soon as possible, as they look to hang on to a spot in the top eight in the East. Their next contest comes on Friday, when they play host to the Raptors.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 98-91, at United Center on Wednesday evening. 

The Grizzlies led 54-50 at halftime, before going on a 10-0 to start the third quarter, stretching their lead to 14, with nine minutes left in the third. However, the Bulls managed to battle back with an 11-2 run of their own, cutting the deficit to five points with 5:22 left in the quarter. The Bulls continued to battle, keeping it close, with the score at 85-83 with 4:20 left in the fourth, but Grizzles finished strong to earn the win. 

Marc Gasol and Mike Conley paved the way for the Grizzlies (38-30), with a game-high 27 points each. Gasol added seven assists and six rebounds, while Conley tallied nine rebounds and seven assists. Tony Allen was the only other player to score in double digits for the Grizz, as he finished with 10 points. The Grizzlies bench chipped in 23 points, led by Zach Randolph, who had eight points, nine rebounds and three assists, in 25 minutes. This marked the second straight win for the Grizzlies, who continue to battle for position in the West, where they sit in seventh place, and within reach of fifth. They will be right back in action on Thursday for the second game of a back-to-back, when they take on the Hawks in Atlanta. 

Meanwhile, the Bulls (32-36) struggled from the field, shooting only 37.4 percent. Rajon Rondo was the high-point man for Chicago, with 17 points, while the only other starter to score in double digits was Jimmy Butler, who finished with 14 points on 4-of-16 shooting. Dwyane Wade shot only 3-of-11 from the field on his way to eight points, before leaving the game with an apparent elbow injury. Nikola Mirotic added 14 points off the bench, and Denzel Valentine added 11. The Bulls have slipped down to 10th place in the East and do not have much room for error if they hope to make their way back into the top eight.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 139-100, at Toyota Center on Wednesday night.

The Rockets (47-21) not only came into Wednesday's game having prevailed in four of their previous six contests, but they also had a 134-point outing against the Lakers (20-48) on their ledger from earlier in the season. They managed to top that spectacular mark by jumping out to a 66-52 halftime lead and then erupting for 46 points in the fourth period to put an exclamation point on the rout. Six Houston players hit double digits in the scoring column, and the Rockets also forced 22 turnovers from the Lakers while limiting them to a paltry 12 percent success rate from long range. 

Julius Randle was the only bright spot for Los Angeles, as he posted 32 points, eight rebounds and two assists. Brandon Ingram managed 18 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Jordan Clarkson matched Ingram's point total and added three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Ivica Zubac played only nine minutes due to foul trouble, recording two points, two rebounds and one assist. 

With the comfortable lead in the fourth quarter, no Houston starter except for James Harden played more than 30 minutes. Lou Williams burned his old team once again while pacing the Rockets, as he tallied 30 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two steals. Trevor Ariza led the first unit with 20 points, three rebounds, two assists and four steals. Harden turned in an 18-point, 13-assist, 12-rebound triple-double that also included two steals, although he did commit nine turnovers. Clint Capela followed with a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double that also featured a pair of assists. Nene Hilario and Eric Gordon were productive as reserves as well with matching 10-point efforts.

The Lakers head back home to tangle with the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night, while the Rockets head to the Big Easy to face off with the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday evening as well.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host San Antonio Spurs, 110-106, at AT&T Center on Wednesday. 

While San Antonio was expected to win this game easily, this ended up being one of the tightest games of the season. In fact, there were 10 ties and 21 lead changes in total, as neither team led by more than seven points. The Spurs dominated the statistics, as they won the shooting, rebounding, assisting and block differentials. Free-throw shooting really boosted Portland, as they went 25-of-28, while San Antonio went just 11-of-15 from the charity stripe. The Trail Blazers also took care of business through transition baskets, winning the fastbreak differential, 17-10. 

The Blazers (30-37) need to win almost every game to achieve a playoff berth and this road victory was one of the biggest of the season. Damian Lillard led the way for Portland, as he collected 36 points, three rebounds and four assists. C.J. McCollum finished with 26 points, four rebounds and four assists. Jusuf Nurkic amassed 16 points, nine rebounds, three assists and four steals. On deck for the Blazers is a road matchup against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. 

The Spurs (52-15) are competing for the number-one seed in the west and this loss will clearly hurt that pursuit. Kawhi Leonard did all he could for San Antonio, as he led the team with 34 points, nine rebounds, six assists, three steals and two blocks. LaMarcus Aldridge returned from a heart issue to total 19 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Patty Mills started for Tony Parker and produced 13 points, three rebounds and six assists. David Lee and Pau Gasol both scored in double figures off the bench, as they each provided 12 points and five rebounds a piece. The Spurs will look to play better on Saturday in a road matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies. 

This win for Portland snapped a five-game losing streak against San Antonio in this series and got them within two games of the Denver Nuggets for the eight-seed in the west.

												The visiting Sacramento Kings took down the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, 107-101.

For Sacramento (27-41), rookie Skal Labissiere had a breakout game to lead the team to a win.  Labissiere had a career-high 32 points including 22 in the fourth quarter.  He added a team-high 11 rebounds.  The night was very promising for the young Kings frontcourt, as second-year center Willie Cauley-Stein also stuffed the stat sheet.  Cauley-Stein narrowly missed a five by five, posting 14 points, another 11 rebounds, five assists, four blocks, and four steals.  The tandem was responsible for a strong portion of the team's offense, as the Kings hit only six three-pointers on the night.  Little focus was placed on the deep ball for Sacramento, as the team shot 48 percent on mostly interior shots.  

Phoenix (22-46) had seen some moderate improvement recently, having gone 4-6 in its last 10 games.  Wednesday, however, was not the team's best night.  Star point guard Eric Bledsoe sat the game out for rest, leaving much of the offensive workload to sophomore phenom Devin Booker.  Booker had an abysmal night, shooting just 6-of-26 from the field and ending up almost solely responsible for the Suns' 40 percent shooting on the night.  Forward T.J. Warren, meanwhile, scored a stellar 24 points and shot 12-of-16 on the night in what was Phoenix's best individual showing.  

Phoenix will host the Magic on Friday, while the Kings will visit OKC on Saturday.

												The visiting Milwaukee Bucks took down the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, 97-96.  

Milwaukee (33-34) has come alive of late and has now won eight of its last ten games.  The Bucks narrowly escaped with the win in Los Angeles, avoiding a potential Blake Griffin buzzer-beater that decided the game.  No single member of the Bucks took over the game, as a healthy team approach helped propel Milwaukee to the win.  Six Bucks scored in double digits, but no single player scored more than 16 points in the game.  The high man was wing Khris Middleton, who had 16 points to go along with seven rebounds.  

Los Angeles (40-28) has hit a bit of a rough patch in its season.  The Clippers are now just 5-6 in their last 11 games.  Center DeAndre Jordan enjoyed a feast in the low post on Wednesday, leading the Clippers with 22 points on 9-of-12 shooting along with 17 rebounds.  Star forward Blake Griffin, meanwhile, had 18 points to go with seven rebounds and four assists.  If Los Angeles was able to get the same level of production from its third star, veteran superstar Chris Paul, the end result likely would have been very different.  Paul, however, struggled mightily, committing six turnovers and scoring only six points.  

The Clippers will visit Denver on Thursday, while the Bucks will see the Lakers on Friday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 128-96, at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday evening. 

The Cavs (44-22) came out of the starting blocks on a mission and never looked back, steamrolling the Pistons (33-34) to the tune of 44 points in the first quarter. Their lead was 74-48 by halftime, which set the stage for starters from both teams to eventually call it an early night later in the second half. To say Cleveland had the hot hand from the field would be an understatement, as they posted success rates of 59.7 percent from the field and 63.3 percent from behind the arc. As good as they were on offense, they were just as effective on defense, limited Detroit to respective tallies of 37.4 and 21.1 percent in those categories. With the large second-half lead, the Cavs' second unit enjoyed extended run and posted a collective 48 points.

Tobias Harris paced Detroit with 17 points, two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Maurice Morris managed 13 points and seven boards. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope poured in 11 points and added two boards, two assists and one steal. Ish Smith was the only other Pistons player to notch double digits in the scoring column, as he supplied 12 points, three assists, one rebound and one steal over 21 minutes. Reggie Jackson (six points, six assists, one rebound and one steal) and Andre Drummond (eight points, 14 rebounds and one assist) received just 20 and 27 minutes, respectively, due to the lopsided nature of the contest.

Kyrie Irving led Cleveland with 26 points, six assists and one rebound. Iman Shumpert followed with 18 points and five boards. LeBron James logged yet another triple-double in just 28 minutes, registering 16 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. Reggie Jefferson matched James' point total and added two rebounds, one assist and two steals. The second unit was led by matching 13-point efforts from the Williamses, with Derrick adding an assist and Deron compiling three assists and two rebounds. J.R. Smith totaled 12 points, five rebounds, one assist and one steal over 23 minutes in a reserve role as well.

The Pistons head back home to face the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night, while the Cavaliers also face off with the Jazz in their next contest, which takes place Thursday evening.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 122-104, at Barclay's Center on Tuesday.

Despite the fact that Oklahoma City led for over 40 minutes of this game, it was close throughout the first three quarters. In fact, there were eight ties and 11 lead changes, as the Thunder didn't record a double-digit lead until the final minutes. It took a late run by the Thunder to open things up, as they outscored the Nets, 60-42, in the second half. Rebounding was key, with Oklahoma City wining that battle, 44-30. They also took care of business shooting the ball, hitting 51 percent of their shots to the Nets 47 percent. Oklahoma City took advantage of the assist-to-turnover ratio as well, recording 10 more assists than Brooklyn, while committing three less turnovers. 

The Thunder (38-29) got their winning streak up to three games with this victory, as Russell Westbrook continues to add triple-doubles under his belt. Westbrook collected 25 points, 12 rebounds and 19 assists, despite going just 6-of-18 from the field. Taj Gibson got the start and totaled 19 points and eight rebounds. Victor Oladipo finished with 21 points, three rebounds and four steals. Enes Kanter led the bench with 17 points and five rebounds, while Alex Abrines provided 13 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals of his own off the bench. On dck for Oklahoma City is a road matchup against the Toronto Raptors on Thursday. 

The Nets (12-54) are really struggling right now, but they fought hard here in this tough loss. Brook Lopez led the way, as he contributed 25 points and six rebounds. Jeremy Lin wasn't far behind, accumulating 24 points, two rebounds and five assists. Caris LeVert played just 23 minutes, but still tallied 16 points, five rebounds, two assists and three steals. Brooklyn will look to play better on Thursday in a road matchup versus the New York Knicks.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers 87-81 Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. 

It was a rough start for the Knicks (27-41), who scored just 18 points in the first quarter. Those struggles carried into the second quarter, and the team found themselves down by 10 at the half and they appeared ready to earn their fourth straight loss. A big second half, however, helped turn this around, and they managed to outscore the Pacers (34-33) by 16 in the second half en route to the victory. Carmelo Anthony led the way for New York, recording a double-double of 22 points and 13 rebounds in 41 minutes. Kristaps Porzingis struggled in the outing, shooting just 5-of-17 from the field en route to scoring 11 points, and to make matters worse, he left the game early in the fourth quarter and did not return due to a thigh bruise. 

As for Indiana, it was a forgettable shooting night for them in every aspect of the game. As a team, the Pacers shot just 36.8 percent from the field, 27.6 percent from behind the arc and 60 percent from the free throw line -- although they only attempted 15 shots at the charity stripe. Paul George led the way with over a quarter of the team's points, finishing with 22 points on a rough 9-of-22 shooting performance from the field. Myles Turner was the only other Indiana player to score in double figures, with the big man notching a double-double of 17 points and 12 rebounds in 31 minutes.

Up next, the Knicks will have a rematch with the Nets on Thursday, while the Pacers will head home Wednesday to play the Hornets.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 100-77 Tuesday at Smoothie King Center. 

The Pelicans (27-40) opened up an early lead Tuesday and never let go of it, as after entering halftime with a 14-point edge and ultimately going into the final period with a insurmountable 23-point lead. It didn't come without an injury scare, however, as Anthony Davis left in the second quarter with an ankle injury, but after X-rays came back negative, the star big man returned to the game after halftime. Davis still managed to finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds in 29 minutes Tuesday, while DeMarcus Cousins scored a team-high 22 points to go along with nine rebounds, three assists and three steals. In the end, it was a total team effort for New Orleans, with a total of six Pelicans players scoring in double figures. 

As for the Trail Blazers (29-37), it was complete opposite kind of effort. It was a one-man show, with Damian Lillard scoring a game-high 29 points on 8-of-18 shooting from the field in just 31 minutes. Only one of his teammates, however, managed to score in double figures, with the team's next highest scorer being Shabazz Napier, who had 10 points in 19 minutes. As a team, it was a shooting night to forget for Portland, as the team shot just 30.3 percent from the field and 34.4 percent from the three-point line. It was the first time the Trail Blazers failed to score 100 points in 10 games. 

Up next, the Pelicans will look to win their third straight game when they travel to Miami on Wednesday, while the Trail Blazers will head to San Antonio on Wednesday to play the Spurs.

												The host Golden State Warriors squeaked by the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday, 106-104.  

The win gave Golden State (53-14) control of the first seed in the West once again after a four-game losing streak caused the Warriors to fall behind San Antonio in the standings.  While the Dubs looked destined to fall in a fifth straight contest on Tuesday, the team managed to come back from down by 16 in the third quarter to earn a narrow win. Much of Golden State's success was due to strong play from Draymond Green, who barely missed a five by five.  Green led the team with eight assists, seven rebounds, six blocks, and four steals while scoring an impressive 20 points including several clutch free-throws in the fourth quarter.  Green's performance helped to make up for some of reigning MVP Steph Curry's slumping.  Curry, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Tuesday, led the team with 29 points but shot just 8-of-23 along with five turnovers.

Philadelphia (24-43) nearly pulled off the stunning win but slowed down at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  The team still had plenty of positive takeaways from the win, however.  Rookie phenom Dario Saric scored in double digits for the 17th straight game, leading the team with 24 points.  His output almost matched Green's, as he dished out six assists, had seen rebounds, blocked two shots, and came away with three steals. Sophomore center Jahlil Okafor was another bright spot for Philly.  Okafor scored 22 points in just 23 minutes of play while shooting 8-of-15 from the field and 6-of-7 from the free-throw line.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 115-109, at Spectrum Center on Monday night. 

The Bulls (31-35) had looked particularly sluggish during the five-game losing streak they'd come in to Monday with, as even the normally dependable Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade had appeared to fall victim to the malaise. In an attempt to shake matters up, head coach Fred Hoiberg opted to reinsert the mercurial Rajon Rondo into the starting lineup and bring Nikola Mirotic back into the rotation, with moves key to the road victory. Rondo provided 20 points, seven rebounds, six assists and one steal over 36 minutes to help complement resurgent performances on the first unit from Butler and Wade, while Mirotic ended up topping the team in scoring on the night. Chicago also got off on the right foot with a 36-24 lead after one quarter, a foundation that ultimately helped them hold on for the hard-fought win.

Mirotic provided 24 points off the bench, which he supplemented with 11 rebounds. Butler and Wade led the way on the starting five with matching 23-point efforts, with the former dishing out 11 assists, hauling in six rebounds and recording a pair of steals and blocks apiece, and the latter posting five assists, one rebound, two steals and one block. Denzel Valentine continued his recent stretch of solid play as a reserve with 11 points, five boards and two assists. Robin Lopez and Bobby Portis had quiet nights, tallying six and five points, respectively, while combining for nine rebounds and three assists.

The Hornets (29-38) saw Jeremy Lamb, who drew the start for Nicolas Batum (migraine), lead the way with 26 points, a total he supplemented with four rebounds, two assists and two steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was next with 22 points, six boards and one assist. Kemba Walker was right behind with a 21-point, 10-assist double-double that also included four rebounds. Marvin Williams produced a 13-point, 18-rebound double-double that also included five assists and one block. Cody Zeller managed 11 points, seven rebounds, two assists, three blocks and one steal. With such a productive night for the Charlotte starting five, the second unit produced a collective 16 points despite two players (Frank Kaminsky and Marco Belinelli) logging over 20 minutes.

The Bulls head back home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night, while the Hornets travel to Indiana for a Wednesday evening date with the Pacers.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 100-78, at Air Canada Center on Monday.

While this game was close in the first half, Toronto took care of business in the second half to cruise to a win. There were actually six ties and eight lead changes in the first half, as the Raptors then outscored the Mavericks, 50-32, in the second half. Rebounding was the glaring difference in the game, with Toronto winning that battle, 55-34. They also stifled Dallas with their defense, holding the Mavericks to 37 percent from the field and 28 percent from three-point range. 

The Mavericks (28-38) are battling for the eight-seed in the west and losses like this are devastating for that pursuit. Harrison Barnes led Dallas, as he scored 18 points on 7-of-16 shooting. Dirk Nowitzki wasn't far behind, as he tallied 17 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Dwight Powell led the bench, as he provided 10 points and 10 rebounds. It wasn't just a loss in the record book, as Wesley Matthews suffered a calf strain and was unable to return after 17 minutes of action. On deck for Dallas is a road matchup against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.

The Raptors (39-28) had lost four of six headed into this matchup, so this win is just what the doctor ordered. DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto, as he collected 25 points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals on 10-of-17 shooting. Norman Powell finished second on the team, accruing 19 points, five rebounds and three assists. Jonas Valanciunas amassed 14 points and 12 rebounds en route to a double-double. Toronto will look to build off this win in a home matchup against the Oklahoma City thunder on Thursday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 113-93, at FedEx Forum on Monday.

The recent form of these teams would have indicated a closer game, but Memphis took care of business in this wire-to-wire win. In fact, the Grizzlies led by at least seven points for the entirety of the second half, as the final 20-point margin was their largest lead of the game. Memphis was very efficient on offense, shooting 52 percent from the field and 52 percent from three-point range. The Grizzlies also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording nine more assists than Milwaukee, despite committing five less turnovers. 

The Bucks (32-34) snapped a six-game winning streak with this loss, as they simply couldn't match the energy of this hungry Grizzlies team. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee, as he tallied 18 points, five rebounds and four assists. Malcolm Brogdon finished second on the team, providing 15 points and eight assists off the bench. No other player on the roster finished with more than 13 points, five rebounds or four assists. On deck for Milwaukee is a road matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. 

The Grizzlies (37-30) carried a five-game losing streak into this matchup, so a dominating win is just what they needed to get out of this rut. Vince Carter turned back the clock, as he dropped a game-high 24 points on a perfect 8-of-8 shooting. Mike Conley finished second on the team, totaling 20 points, 10 assists and three steals. Marc Gasol collected 13 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Zach Randolph was the lone bench player in double figures, amassing 14 points and seven rebounds. Memphis will look to build off this win on Wednesday in a road matchup versus the Chicago Bulls.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Atlanta Hawks 107-99 Monday at AT&T Center.

Monday's contest marked the return of superstar Kawhi Leonard, who had been out with a concussion, for the Spurs (52-14), and his impact was felt immediately. San Antonio opened up a early lead and managed to hang on throughout the contest, and it was thanks in large part to yet another great performance from Leonard. Leonard finished with a game-high 31 points in 10-of-24 shooting to go along with five rebounds and four assists in 39 minutes. And it was Leonard and the other four starters that managed to carry the team, as those five ended up scoring 78 of the team's 107 points. In the end, it was the Spurs' hot shooting from outside that won them Monday's contest, as they shot a scorching 47 percent as a team from behind the arc.

For the Hawks (37-30), the loss ended a three-game winning streak, and they did not have the same sort of success from three. The team finished shooting just 27.3 percent from behind the arc, with the starting five going just 1-of-9 from deep. Atlanta was equally unsuccessful from the free throw line Monday, where they shot 19-of-30 (63.3 percent) from the charity stripe. Dennis Schroeder led the way for the Hawks on the offensive end, scoring a team-high 22 points and dishing out a game-high 10 assists.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Washington Wizards 119-104 Monday at Target Center. 

The Timberwolves (28-38) didn't waste any time opening up Monday's contest, as they ended the first quarter with an 18-point lead and never let the Wizards (41-25) within one possession, as their smallest lead from that point was five points. Karl-Anthony Towns had his way in the outing, scoring a game-high 39 points on 17-of-26 shooting and grabbing 13 rebounds. Those offensive opportunities for Towns came in large part to the play of Ricky Rubio, who scored 22 points and recorded 19 assists in Monday's matchup. It was a hot shooting night for the team overall, as Minnesota shot 52.3 percent from the field and a scorching 47.6 percent from behind the arc. 

As for Washington, the loss ended a five-game winning streak, but the team has still won seven of its last nine games. They were led, once again, by their backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal. Wall finished with a game-high 27 points, while scored 20 points of his own. The next highest scorer for the Wizards, however, was Bojan Bogdanovic, who shot just 3-of-11 from the field en route to scoring 12 points. It was a poor shooting night all around for Washington, as the team shot just 43 percent from the field and 27 percent from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Timberwolves will travel to Boston on Wednesday to take on the Celtics, while the Wizards will head home to play the Mavericks on Wednesday.

												The host Utah Jazz took down the Los Angeles Clippers in a key game on Monday, 114-108.

Utah (42-25) extended its lead on the four seed to the two games with Monday's win over Los Angeles.  All-Star forward Gordon Hayward was, per usual, the team's leading scorer with 27 points on 9-of-18 shooting.  Center Rudy Gobert, who many consider a favorite for the Defensive Player of the Year Award, also played a crucial role in the win.  Despite a number of testy exchanges with Clippers players, including superstar point guard Chris Paul, Gobert had an efficient 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting and played tough defense against the loaded LA frontcourt.  Thanks in part to Gobert, Utah was able to win the rebounding battle handily.  The Jazz pulled down 42 rebounds to LA's 28.

Los Angeles (40-27) appeared frustrated by the unfortunately-timed loss.  On paper, LA had a stellar offensive night, shooting 50 percent and knocking down 12 three-pointers in the process.  However, the team allowed Utah to shoot an even more impressive 53 percent including 14 threes.  It was also a tough night for the Clippers' big men.  All-Star and offensive wizard Blake Griffin was locked down and held to just eight points in 36 minutes of play.  Center DeAndre Jordan, the league's all-time leader in field goal percentage, shot just 5-of-9 for 12 points.  The duo also combined for only 16 rebounds, well below their season average.  

On Wednesday, the Jazz will visit Detroit while LA will host the Bucks.

												The host Sacramento Kings took down the Orlando Magic on Monday, 120-115.

Sacramento (26-41) saw a well-rounded team effort in the win over Orlando.  Seven players scored in double figures, and the team racked up a whopping 120 points without any 20-point scorers.  The high scorers were point guard Darren Collison, who also dished out a team-high 13 assists, and Anthony Tolliver.  Both had 19 points.  It was a stellar team offensive night on the whole for Sacramento, as the Kings shot almost 54 percent from the field with 16 three-pointers made.  The Kings saw their best efficiency post All-Star Break, as the team continues to adjust to life without superstar center DeMarcus Cousins.

Orlando (24-44) ended with a disappointing loss despite a stellar offensive outing of their own.  Point guard Elfrid Payton recorded a triple-double, his third in six games.  Payton recorded 13 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds.  Magic center Nikola Vucevic also had a stellar game, scoring 23 points while shooting 10-of-17 from the field and pulling down nine rebounds.  As a team, Orlando dished out an impressive 32 assists and shot a stellar 47 percent from the field.  The Magic also hit 13 three-pointers on the night.

The Kings will visit Phoenix on Wednesday, while the Magic will visit Golden State on Thursday.

												The Denver Nuggets blew out the Los Angeles Lakers 129-101 at Staples Center on Monday. 

Denver (32-35) inches closer to a .500 record for the season and more importantly, show cased their ability to blow out the bottom tier teams while also staving off the Portland Trail Blazers for the 8-seed in the Western Conference playoffs picture. Depth was on display for the Nuggets in the rout, as they went up 67-43 at the half and handed over much of the work to the bench, who also flexed their scoring prowess in the win. The Lakers (20-47) were unable to match the shooting efficiency the Nuggets had going, and finished 30 percent from three point range and 43.3 percent from the field, compared to the lights out 53.6 percent effort by Denver. 

Nikola Jokic and Danilo Gallinari each scored 18 points, and combined for 12 rebounds and nine assists. Mason Plumlee scored 15 points and added 10 rebounds across 36 minutes. Jamal Murray and Will Barton each pitched in 22 points and each played 30 minutes, and combined for nine three-pointers. 

Lakers Ivan Zubac drew the start at center and offered a bright spot in the box score. Zubac scored 25 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out an assist in 30 minutes. Jordan Clarkson added 19 points on 7-of-18 shooting, while Brandon Ingram pitched in 14 points, one rebound and two assists. 

Next up, the Lakers visit the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Nuggets host the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls, 100-80, at TD Center on Sunday evening. 

The Celtics (42-25) had hit a few bumps on their Western Conference swing, losing three of the last four contests of the road trip. A return home turned out to be just what the doctor ordered, as Boston dominated the Bulls (31-35) on both ends of the floor. Their defensive effort was particularly inspired, as they limited Chicago to a 37.9 percent success rate from the floor and 28 percent from three-point range. They also forced 17 turnovers, won the rebounding battle by a 51-40 margin, saw their bench combine for 42 points, and jumped out to a 46-26 lead halftime lead, giving them a definitive advantage they wouldn't relinquish.

Robin Lopez paced Chicago with 13 points, three rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Denzel Valentine matched Lopez' point total while leading the bench and added three boards. Bobby Portis turned in 12 points and eight rebounds. Dwyane Wade struggled through an uncharacteristically poor game, supplying just eight points, three rebounds and two steals. Jimmy Butler was even worse, posting five points (on 2-for-11 shooting), seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Cristiano Felicio was solid off the bench as usual with 10 points, four rebounds and one steal.

Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston with 22 points, two assists, one rebound and three steals. Avery Bradley provided 17 points, six rebounds, one assist, three steals and one block. Al Horford registered 12 points, seven rebounds, six assists, two blocks and one steal. Jae Crowder tallied a modest five points but hauled in 10 rebounds. Marcus Smart led a productive second unit with 12 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. Jaylen Brown and Kelly Olynyk pitched in with matching 11-point efforts, with the former adding three rebounds, one assist and one steal, and the latter generating nine boards, three assists and one steal.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the New York Knicks, 120-112, at Barclays Center on Sunday evening. 

The Nets (12-53) had come in to Saturday's game on somewhat of a high note by their standards, as they'd notched two of their 11 victories on the season within the previous six games. They played an inspired first half as well, jumping out to a 67-49 lead by intermission. However, the Knicks (26-41) regrouped at halftime and came out firing in the third, outscoring their hosts by a 31-24 margin during the period. They managed to get as close as 106-101 with 5:09 remaining in the game after a Carmelo Anthony three-point jumper, but Jeremy Lin, who'd missed his first nine shots from the field, drained a three-pointer, and rookie Caris LaVert drained a 25-footer of his own just over 30 seconds later to push the lead back up to nine. New York made one last surge by getting to within 118-112 after a Derrick Rose basket with 1:08 remaining but would go scoreless the rest of the way. The Nets emerged victorious thanks in large part to their marksmanship, as they shot 46 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range, while also seeing seven players tally double digits in the scoring column. 

Carmelo Anthony led the way for the Knicks with 27 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, three assists and one block. Kristaps Porzingis contributed a 19-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and five blocks. Derrick Rose provided 17 points, five boards, two assists and two steals. Courtney Lee went for 15 points, two rebounds, one assist and one steal. Lance Thomas led the bench with 13 points, five rebounds, four assists and one block. 

Brook Lopez paced the Nets in his return from a one-game absence with 25 points, six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson posted a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one block. Trevor Booker matched Hollis-Jefferson's point total off the bench and added nine rebounds. Lin and LaVert supplied matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding five assists, four rebounds and one steal, and the latter registering four rebounds, four assists and a pair of steals. Quincy Acy (12 points, six boards, one assist) and Isaiah Whitehead (10 points, three rebounds, two assists, two steals) were productive in reserve roles as  well.

The Knicks head back across town to tangle with the visiting Indiana Pacers on Tuesday evening, while the Nets remain home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on the same night.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Miami Heat, 102-98, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday. 

In a battle between two teams battling for a playoff spot in the east, Indiana were able to prevail with a much needed victory. They led for the majority of this game, as Miami never led by more than four points and only held the lead for a total of five minutes. Free-throw shooting was the decisive statistic, with Indiana going 27-of-32 from the charity stripe, while Miami could only go 11-of-16. Fastbreak points was also a glaring difference, with the Pacers winning that battle, 16-0. 

The Heat (32-35) had to play this game without Goran Dragic (eye), as they simply didn't have enough bullets to beat this hungry Pacers team. Hassan Whiteside did all he could for Miami, as he totaled 26 points and 21 rebounds in the defeat. Dion Waiters was the only other starter in double figures, as he collected 20 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Wayne Ellington led the bench, as he dropped 19 points on 7-of-13 shooting. James Johnson also played well off the bench, providing 14 points and four rebounds. The Heat will be off until Wednesday, when they host the struggling New Orleans Pelicans for their next game. 

The Pacers (34-32) have been dominant at home all season, with this win giving them their 23rd home victory of the year. Paul George was the player of the game, tallying 28 points and 10 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 15 points and eight rebounds. Jeff Teague accrued 12 points, five rebounds and four assists. Thaddeus Young was the only other Pacer in double figures, as he amassed 13 points and five rebounds. Indiana's next game is on Tuesday in a road matchup against the New York Knicks.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 110-101, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday.

This game meant much more to the Blazers than the Suns and that proved to be the case with this important Portland win. Despite the Suns leading for the majority of the first quarter, Portland actually held the lead for 40 of the final 42 minutes. Portland ended the game on an 11-4 run to pull away and eventually win. Shooting was key, as the Blazers hit 50 percent of their shots, while holding the Suns to 44 percent shooting. Rebounding was also a big factor, with Portland winning that battle, 49-42. 

The Blazers (29-36) are battling for the eight-seed in the west and to say this win was crucial would be a drastic understatement. Damian Lillard was the star, as he led the team with 39 points, six rebounds and two assists. C.J. McCollum finished with 26 points, four rebounds and four assists. Jusuf Nurkic was the only other player in double figures, as he tallied 12 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Al-Farouq Aminu was a nice spark off the bench, providing nine points and 12 rebounds. On deck for the Blazers is a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday. 

The Suns (22-45) had won four of six headed into this game, but they couldn't quite hold off a hungry Portland bunch. Devin Booker led Phoenix in scoring, as he accumulated 28 points, five rebounds and three assists. Eric Bledsoe finished second on the team, accruing 19 points, three rebounds, five assists and two steals. Alan Williams came off the bench to produce another double-double, totaling 12 points and 10 rebounds. Phoenix won't play until Wednesday, when they host the Sacramento Kings for their next game.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 117-112, at Toyota Center on Sunday. 

This was a matchup full of stars and none of them disappointed. There was an NBA record tied in this game, as there were 88 combined three-point attempts. There were eight ties and 16 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 14 points. Cleveland actually dominated the shooting, as they outshot Houston from the field, from three-point range and from the free-throw line. Rebounding was the glaring difference for the Rockets, as they won that differential, 52-38. Houston were also playing great defense, recording 10 steals to Cleveland's three. 

The Cavaliers (43-22) have now lost five of their last seven games, as they continue to struggle on defense. LeBron James led the way for Cleveland, as he accumulated 30 points, seven rebounds and five assists, despite committing eight turnovers. Kyrie Irving accrued 28 points, three rebounds, eight assists and two blocks. Richard Jefferson was the only other player in double figures, as he dropped 16 points on a perfect 6-of-6 shooting. On deck for the Cavaliers is a home matchup against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday. 

The Rockets (46-21) continue to take their three-point shooting barrage through the NBA and a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers shows just how much they have improved. James Harden recorded his 16th triple-double of the season, as he collected 38 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Ryan Anderson finished second on the team, totaling 16 points and six rebounds. Nene Hilario came off the bench to provide 12 points, six rebounds and three steals, while Eric Gordon led the bench with 13 points. Houston will look to keep rolling on Wednesday in a favorable home matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 118-116, at Staples Center on Sunday. 

Rookie Dario Saric scored a career-high 29 points and Jahlil Okafor added 23 to lead the 76ers, who oddly might have been better off losing to the Lakers. Los Angeles' No. 1 draft pick this summer will flip to the 76ers if the Lakers finish better than one of the three worst records in the league this season. With the loss, the Lakers have the league's second-worst record at 20-46. 

Jordan Clarkson scored a career-high 30 points for the Lakers, who rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to take the lead, 112-111, with about a minute to play. After the 76ers took the lead back on a T.J. McConnell field goal, the Lakers' D'Angelo Russell committed a shot-clock violation to hand the ball, and the game, back to Philadelphia. 

Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot added 18 points for the 76ers, who were without forward Robert Covington because of a right knee injury. Julius Randle posted a double-double with 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Lakers. 

The 76ers end their three-game road trip Friday at the Golden State Warriors. The Lakers travel to Denver Monday to face the Nuggets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Utah Jazz, 112-104, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday afternoon.

The Jazz (41-25) learned shortly before tip-off that star center Rudy Gobert would miss his first game of the season due to knee soreness. That left Utah without a key rim protector against the Russell Westbrook and the Thunder (37-29) in the battle of Western Conference playoff contenders. Westbrook took full advantage of the Stifle Tower's absence, notching his 32nd career triple-double to vault over Wilt Chamberlain for second place on the all-time leaderboard, as he compiled 33 points, 14 assists, 11 rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Both teams shot very well, with the Jazz posting respective success rates of 48 percent from the floor and 45 percent from behind the arc, and the Thunder draining 50 percent of their overall shot attempts. However, without their dominant big man down low, Utah lost the rebounding battle by a 43-36 margin.

The Jazz's scoring distribution was rather unorthodox, with no starter hitting double digits in the scoring column and the top two point totals therefore emanating from the bench. Dante Exum led the way with 22 points, which he supplemented with one rebound and one assist. He received 26 minutes with starting point guard George Hill somewhat limited by a troublesome toe. Alec Burks followed with 21 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Trey Lyles was the third productive reserve, as he posted 10 points, five rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. The first unit was paced by matching nine-point efforts from Hill and Gordon Hayward. The former added one rebound, one assist and two steals, while the latter supplied three boards and one steal. However, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson and Jeff Withey, the remaining members of the starting five, only combined for 11 points.

Victor Oladipo was second behind his backcourt mate on the Thunder with 22 points, four assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Taj Gibson parlayed his start into 15 points and six rebounds. Steven Adams produced a near double-double of 11 points, nine rebounds, two steals and one block. Andre Roberson rounded out the first unit's solid afternoon with eight points, three rebounds, two steals and one block. Enes Kanter led the bench with 16 points, six rebounds, one assist and two blocks. 

The Jazz head back home to take on the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night, while the Thunder head to the Big Apple to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday evening.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 112-100, at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon.

The Clippers (40-26) were looking to extend a recent winning stretch that had seen them emerge victorious in three of their previous four games, but knew they'd have a challenge in the form of the considerably improved Sixers (23-42). That came to fruition throughout the first three-plus quarters, as Philadelphia actually entered the fourth period in possession of a 79-75 advantage. However, Los Angeles came alive at that point, outscoring their visitors by a 37-21 margin in the final 12 minutes to secure the double-digit win. Four members of the Clippers first unit managed to score in double digits, and Chris Paul led the way with a game-high 30 points on 11-for-16 shooting, along with seven assists, three rebounds and two steals.

The Sixers were led by 24 points off the bench from Richaun Holmes, a total he supplemented with nine rebounds. Dario Saric paced the first unit with 16 points, five rebounds, two assists and one block. Jahlil Okafor managed 14 points, four boards, four assists and three steals. Robert Covington tallied 13 points, six rebounds and three steals. T.J. McConnell generated nine points, 10 assists, one rebound and two steals. Timothe Luwawu-Cabbarot matched McConnell's scoring total and added five rebounds, one assist and one steal.

DeAndre Jordan followed Paul with a 19-point, 20-rebound double-double that also included four assists, one steal and three blocks. Blake Griffin turned in a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double that also featured six assists and three steals. J.J. Redick played an effective complementary role, pouring in 12 points and adding two rebounds, two assists and two steals. Mareese Speights led the second uniit with 11 points, two boards and one assist. 

The Sixers remain in California to take on the Lakers on Sunday evening, while the Clippers head to Utah for a Monday night tilt versus the Jazz.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the New York Knicks, 112-92, at Palace at Auburn Hills on Saturday evening.

The Knicks (26-40) put together a balanced offensive effort and tallied success rates north of 40 percent from both the field and three-point range. However, a pair of spectacular performances from Tobias Harris and Andre Drummond, along with some solid defense overall, helped neutralize those accomplishments. The Pistons (33-33) caused 18 turnovers, didn't allow an individual point total higher than 18 and limited New York to just 11 points in the fourth quarter overall.

Kristaps Porzingis paced the Knicks with 18 points, which he supplemented with six rebounds, four assists and six blocks. Willy Hernangomez posted a near double-double of 14 points, nine rebounds, three assists and one steal. Courtney Lee and Carmelo Anthony posted matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding seven rebounds, five assists and one steal, and the latter providing four assists and one rebound. Derrick Rose registered 11 points, two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Chasson Randle generated 12 points and three assists to lead the bench.

Harris' 28 points led the way for the visitors, a total he complemented with seven rebounds, five assists and two blocks. Drummond managed a massive 24-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included three steals and one block. Reggie Jackson went for 19 points, eight assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope totaled nine points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Jon Leuer led the second unit with 11 points and three rebounds. 

The Knicks tangle with their intrastate rival Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center on Sunday evening, while the Pistons visit the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night.

												The New Orleans Pelicans escaped Charlotte with a 125-122 overtime win against the Hornets, at Spectrum Center on Saturday evening. 

The Pelicans (26-40) nearly let this one slip away, as they led by seven with 2:40 left in the fourth, but allowed the Hornets (29-37) to come back and tie it up, thanks to a three-pointer by Nicolas Batum with 49 seconds remaining. Luckily for New Orleans, Anthony Davis was on fire and was able to carry his team through overtime and to the win. Meanwhile, DeMarcus Cousins did not play in the overtime period, as a coach's decision. 

Anthony Davis led the way for the Pelicans with a monstrous line including 46 points, 21 rebounds, four assists and one block, in 45 minutes. Five other players scored in double digits for the Pelicans, including Jordan Crawford, who poured in 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting, in 27 minutes off the bench. Jrue Holiday was solid with 15 points and 13 assists, while Solomon Hill chipped in 16 points. DeMarcus Cousins was quiet with only 11 points, four rebounds and four assists, in 25 minutes. The Pelicans next contest is on Tuesday, when they play host to the Trail Blazers. 

Meanwhile, Marvin Williams continued his strong play, as he led the Hornets with 27 points and 10 rebounds in 40 minutes. Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum finished with 24 points each, while Jeremy Lamb added 14 off the bench. Marco Belinelli was the only other player to score in double digits for Charlotte, as he chipped in 12 points, in 23 minutes off the bench.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Orlando Magic, 116-104, at Amway Center on Saturday evening. 

The Magic (24-43) started out strong and owned a one-point advantage after the first quarter. However, LeBron James and the Cavs (43-21) were not about to drop their fourth straight, as they came back strong in the second, to take a 59-51 lead into half time. The teams tied the third quarter, before the Cavs pulled further away in the fourth. 

LeBron James notched a triple-double, as he led the way for the Cavs with 24 points on 8-of-14 shooting, 13 assists and 12 rebounds, in 38 minutes. Six other players scored in double digits in Cleveland's well-rounded attack, including Kyrie Irving, who poured in 22 points and Iman Shumpert, with 15 points. Channing Frye, Deron Williams and J.R. Smith all scored in double figures off the bench. The Cavs needed this win to end their three-game losing streak. They will look to begin a winning streak, as they face the second game of a back-to-back, in Houston on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Nikola Vucevic led the way for the Magic, with 20 points on 9-of-20 shooting, to go along with 16 rebounds, in 28 minutes, in his first game back after missing four games due to injury. Aaron Gordon chipped in 16 points and Evan Fournier added 15 points, while Terrence Ross was the only other player to score in double digits, as he added 10. This is the Magic's second straight loss. They will look to bounce back, when they visit Sacramento to take on the Kings on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks hung on to defeat the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 102-95, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Saturday evening. 

The Bucks (32-33) earned their sixth straight win, and took another step towards solidifying their spot in the top eight in the East, as they used a well-rounded team effort to out-last the pesky Timberwolves (27-38). The Bucks led by four after the first quarter, and while they slipped a little bit in the second quarter, came out strong and out-scored Minnesota by seven in the second half to secure the win.

Giannis Antetokounmpo followed up with 18 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two blocks, in 40 minutes, while Matthew Dellavedova chipped in 16 points, in 28 minutes. John Henson, Greg Monroe and Rashad Vaughn all chipped in double digits off the bench. The Bucks will look to build on their impressive winning streak, as they go on to visit Memphis on Monday. 

Meanwhile, Karl-Anthony Towns put up a monstrous performance with 35 points on 14-of-21 shooting, 14 rebounds, two blocks, one assist and one steal, in 40 minutes. Ricky Rubio followed up with 22 points and eight assists, in 28 minutes, while the only other player to score in double digits for the T-Wolves was Andrew Wiggins, who finished with 11. Only four players came off the bench for Minnesota, to contribute 16 points combined. The Timberwolves go on to host the Wizards on Monday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the visiting Toronto Raptors, 104-89, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday evening. 

The Raptors (38-28) came out flat on the second night of a back-to-back, resulting in their second straight loss. They shot 37.5 percent from the field and only 2-of-15 from long range. The Heat (32-34) on the other hand, came out on fire, with a 32-point first quarter and won the second quarter 27-15, to take a 59-41 lead into halftime. Miami then held on through the second half to earn their fourth straight win and come one step closer to a spot in the top eight in the East. 

Dion Waiters was the high-point man for Miami, with 20 points on 6-of-10 shooting, including 4-of-6 from deep. Five other players scored in double digits for the Heat, including Goran Dragic, who chipped in 15. Dragic had his night cut short after 17 minutes of action, as he took a hit in the eye, which resulted in swelling. Hassan Whiteside double-doubled, with 12 points and 14 rebounds, to go along with four blocks, in 33 minutes, while Tyler Johnson added 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting, in 27 minutes off the bench. The Heat will look to keep rolling, as they face the second game of a back-to-back in Indiana on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, despite shooting 5-of-16, DeMar DeRozan was the high point man for the Raptors, with 17 points in 28 minutes of action. Norman Powell got the start in place of DeMarre Carroll and finished with 14 points on 5-of-14 shooting. Jonas Valanciunas finished with 10 points on 5-of-6 shooting, and 10 rebounds, in only 21 minutes. The Raptors will look to bounce back and avoid a third straight loss, as they play host the Mavericks on Monday.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Golden State Warriors, 107-85, at AT&T Center on Saturday. 

The laundry list of superstars who sat out this game is endless, but the Spurs were able to add another win under their belt to come one game closer to the Warriors for that coveted number-one seed in the west. It was a near wire-to-wire win for San Antonio, as they led for over 46 minutes of this game, with Golden State's only lead coming in the first quarter. The second half was especially lopsided, as the Spurs led by at least 10 points for the entire third quarter and expanded that by holding at least an 18-point lead for the whole fourth quarter. Golden State's offense clearly wasn't the same without their studs, as they shot 36 percent from the field and 29 percent from three-point range. San Antonio shot 52 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range.

The Warriors (52-14) played this game without Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, as they simply didn't have enough in the arsenal to beat a better Spurs second-unit. Ian Clark was a bright spot, as he provided 36 points and five rebounds on 15-of-21 shooting off the bench. Matt Barnes led the starters with 14 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Zaza Pachulia recorded an 11-point, 12-rebound double-double, as the only regular starter to feature for the Warriors. On deck for Golden State is a home matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday.  

The Spurs (51-14) were without Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge for this matchup, but their second-unit came in and took care of business against this B-team Warriors squad. Patty Mills led San Antonio, totaling 21 points, two rebounds and four assists. Kyle Anderson contributed 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Pau Gasol came off the bench to accrue 10 points, seven rebounds and three assists. while Davis Bertans led the bench with 13 points, The Spurs will return to action on Monday in a home matchup against the Atlanta Hawks.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies, 107-90, at FedEx Forum on Saturday.

It's rare to see Memphis dominated at home so badly, but that's just how things have been going for the Grizzlies over recent weeks. This one was over early, as Atlanta took an 18-point lead after the first quarter and led by double-digits for the entirety of the second half. It ended up being a wire-to-wire win for the Hawks as well. Defense was key for Atlanta, as they held Memphis to 38 percent from the field and 17 percent shooting from three-point range. The Hawks also took care of the defensive rebounding, winning that battle, 40-28. 

The Hawks (37-29) have now won three-straight, as this marks one of their best victories of the season. Paul Millsap collected 16 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Dennis Schroeder was just as good, accumulating 16 points, seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals. Taurean Prince was a huge spark off the bench, providing 17 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals on 5-of-6 shooting. Atlanta will be in action again on Monday in a road matchup versus the San Antonio Spurs. 

The Grizzlies (36-30) are really struggling right now, as this marks their fifth-straight loss. Mike Conley accrued 16 points, five assists and five steals as one of the only effective players for Memphis. JaMychal Green started and led the team by totaling 20 points and 11 rebounds. Marc Gasol could only muster up eight points, six rebounds and two assists. The Grizzlies will look to get out of this slide on Monday in a home matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 100-98, at American Airlines Center on Saturday. 

Dallas needed this game much more than Phoenix, but Devin Booker and the Suns played spoiler late. In fact, Booker scored the final eight points for Phoenix, as he hit a game-winning jumper at the buzzer to seal the win. There were 14 ties and 16 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than seven points. Defense was key for the Suns, as they held the Mavericks to 38 percent shooting, while Phoenix shot 47 percent on their end. Scoring in the paint was a huge factor as well, with the Suns winning that battle, 38-20. 

The Suns (22-44) have now won four of their last six games, as they continue to disappoint playoff contenders. Booker was the star, as he scored a game-high 36 points, including that game-winner. He did that damage on 12-of-20 shooting, while also bringing down five rebounds. T.J. Warren finished second on the team, totaling 16 points and eight rebounds. Eric Bledsoe accumulated 12 points, two rebounds and six assists. Tyler Ulis and Alan Williams came off the bench to combine for 18 points, eight rebounds, six assists, two steals and three blocks. On deck for Phoenix is a home matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. 

The Mavericks (28-37) needed this game to stay within one game of the eight-seed in the west, but they allowed a 22-win Phoenix team to play major spoiler. Dirk Nowitzki did all he could for Dallas, as he amassed 23 points and 11 rebounds on 10-of-14 shooting. Harrison Barnes shot just 5-of-16 from the field, but matched Nowitzki's 23 points, adding seven rebounds to his tally. Devin Harris was the only bench player in double figures, tallying 14 points, three rebounds and two assists. The Mavericks will return to action on Monday in a road matchup against the Toronto Raptors.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 125-124, at Moda Center on Saturday. 

While this appeared to be a blowout at halftime, the Wizards heard something in the locker room that completely turned this game around. Portland took a 70-49 lead headed into the half, but they completely collapsed by allowing the Wizards to outscore them, 63-42, in the second half to send it to overtime. Markieff Morris then played hero, as he hit the game-winning shot with 0.4 seconds left, despite the fact that it appeared he stepped out of bounds prior to the shot. Both offenses were efficient, with Washington shooting 52 percent to Portland's 51 percent. Fastbreak points was the only noticeable difference in the stat sheet, with the Wizards winning that battle, 15-7.

The Wizards (41-24) overcame a huge halftime deficit to send this game to overtime, as this marked their second game in two nights in which they overcame a double-digit halftime deficit. John Wall was fantastic, as he led the team with 39 points, two rebounds and nine assists. Bradley Beal finished second on the team, totaling 26 points and six assists. Marcin Gortat and Markieff Morris each recorded a double-double, combining for 28 points and 26 rebounds. Otto Porter provided 18 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. On deck for the Wizards is a road matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday. 

The Blazers (28-36) are battling for the eight-seed in the west and blown leads like this won't help that pursuit. C.J. McCollum led Portland with 34 points, adding six assists to an otherwise empty line. Damian Lillard collected 33 points, three rebounds and seven assists. Maurice Harkless amassed 15 points and five rebounds. Allen Crabbe was the best bench player, as he accrued 14 points, six rebounds and two assists. Al-Farouq Aminu also came off the bench to tally 11 points and eight rebounds. Portland will look to bounce back on Sunday in a road matchup against the Phoenix Suns.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Sacramento Kings, 105-92, at Golden One Center on Saturday. 

This was a game that meant a lot more to Denver than Sacramento, as they really took control from start to finish. In fact, the Kings held just one one-point lead in the first quarter, with Denver leading for 47 minutes of this game. Free-throw shooting was decisive, with the Nuggets going 16-of-18 from the charity stripe, while the Kings could only go 12-of-20. Denver ended up shooting 47 percent from the field, while Sacramento fell just shy of 44 percent. 

The Nuggets (31-35) are barely holding on to the eight-seed in the west, so to say this win was needed is a drastic understatement. Gary Harris led the way for Denver, as he tallied 24 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals on 10-of-15 shooting. Nikola Jokic finished second on the team, totaling 20 points, 14 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Danilo Gallinari accrued 15 points, five rebounds and two assists. Jamal Murray led the bench with 14 points, three rebounds and two steals, while Mason Plumlee provided eight points, seven rebounds and eight assists of his own off the pine. On deck for Denver is a home matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. 

The Kings (25-41) continue to struggle without DeMarcus Cousins, as they have now lost eight-straight games. Buddy Hield led Sacramento in scoring, as he amassed 17 points, six rebounds and three assists on 6-of-8 shooting. Tyreke Evans finished second on the team with 16 points, three rebounds and two assists off the bench. Willie Cauley-Stein collected 13 points, five rebounds and five assists. Sacramento will look to snap this slide on Monday in a home matchup with the Orlando Magic.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic, 121-81, at Spectrum Center on Friday. 

The Hornets were expected to win this game and they left no doubt with this dominating victory. Not only did Charlotte win all four quarters in their wire-to-wire win, they held a 20-point lead for the final 23 minutes. Shooting was key, with the Hornets shooting 60 percent from the field and 48 percent from three-point range. The Magic could only muster up 41 percent shooting from the field and 19 percent from three-point range. The rebounding was a huge factor as well, with Charlotte winning that battle, 43-31. The Hornets also recorded 34 assists, while the Magic only dished out 19. 

The Magic (24-42) are now just 1-3 across their last four games, with this loss being one of the worst of the season. Aaron Gordon led Orlando, as he tallied 20 points and five rebounds. Evan Fournier was the only other starter in double figures, as he accrued 14 points and two assists. Elfrid Payton scored just eight points, but handed out 12 of the teams 19 assists. Mario Hezonja led the bench with 11 points. Orlando will be in action again on Saturday in a home matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers. 

The Hornets (29-36) have now won three of their last four games, as they look to keep their playoff hopes alive. Kemba Walker scored a game-high 23 points, as he did that damage on 9-of-13 shooting. Nicolas Batum ran the offense, collecting 15 points, three rebounds and 10 assists. Marvin Williams had one of his best games of the season, accumulating 12 points, 18 rebounds and seven assists. Four players came off the bench to score at least 10 points, as Marco Belinelli led them with 18 points. On deck for Charlotte is a home matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls, 115-94, at United Center on Friday evening. 

The Rockets (45-21) have been one of the NBA's best squads all season, and a great deal of their success is rightfully attributed to their prolific offense. Typically, it's the spectacular efforts of James Harden that spearhead the Houston attack, but Friday's path to victory was a bit of a departure from the norm. It was the returning Ryan Anderson, who'd missed the team's tilt against the Jazz on Wednesday with a back injury, that led the way with 21 points, three rebounds and one steal. Additionally, a stellar defensive effort, one that saw Houston limit their hosts to success rates of 38.8 percent from the field and 23.1 percent from three-point range, while also forcing them into 18 turnovers, that was pivotal to the win. The Rockets also outscored the Bulls (31-34) by a whopping 69-30 margin over the second and third periods, sealing the win before the fourth quarter even began.

Harden was second behind Anderson with 19 points, 13 assists, seven rebounds and three steals. He left the game late in the first quarter for a time after getting his foot stepped on but ultimately returned. Clint Capela followed with 17 points, seven boards and one assist.  Trevor Ariza turned in an 11-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included one assist and two steals. Lou Williams led the bench with 18 points, three rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. 

Dwyane Wade paced the Bulls in his return from a two-game absence due to a thigh injury, as he collected 21 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Jimmy Butler totaled 16 points, five rebounds, four assists and one steal. Cameron Payne led the bench with 11 points, two rebounds, two assists and one steal. Bobby Portis produced eight points, six rebounds and one steal, while Paul Zipser, Rajon Rondo and Denzel Valentine all matched Portis' point total off the bench.

The Rockets remain home and await the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night, while the Bulls make the trek to Beantown for a Sunday afternoon showdown with the Boston Celtics.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers 99-85 at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening. 

The Pacers led by five, 50-45, at halftime but the Bucks came out charging in the third quarter, where they out-scored the Pacers 29-11. The Bucks carried the momentum into the fourth, where they continued to dominate, winning the quarter 25-17, to amass the 14-point winning margin and their fifth-straight win. This was a huge win for the Bucks (31-33), as it propels them into the eighth seed in the East, in part thanks the Bull's loss on Friday night. The Pacers (33-32) sit sixth in the East, and are a team that the Bucks are chasing, making the win even sweeter for Milwaukee. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for the Bucks, with 21 points to go along with eight rebounds, five assists, five steals and one block, in 39 minutes. Khris Middleton added 21 points on 7-of-14 shooting, in 37 minutes. Antetokounmpo (six) and Middleton (seven) both struggled with turnovers, combining for 13 of the team's 22. The Bucks shot 51.6 percent in the contest, including 41.2 percent from deep. The Bucks will face the second night of a back-to-back, as they go on to host the Timberwolves on Saturday. 

Paul George led the way for the Pacers, with 18 points on 5-of-14 shooting, 11 rebounds, six assists and three steals, as he led the team in all four categories, in 42 minutes. Jeff Teague finished with 17 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals, in 35 minutes, while Monta Ellis chipped in 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting, off the bench. This marks the third loss in five games for the Pacers, who will look to bounce back, as they play host to the Heat on Sunday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the visiting Golden State Warriors 103-102, at Target Center, on Friday evening. 

It was a dramatic contest, as the Timberwolves jumped out to a 10-point lead, with a 34-24 first quarter. The Warriors responded in the second, where they out-scored the T-Wolves by one. The Timberwolves came back strong in the third, ensuring themselves a 12-point lead heading into the final quarter. Minnesota then extended their lead to 14, however the Warriors went on a 13-0 run to bring the game within one point with 7:28 to go. It was then back and forth, with the T-Wolves staying on top, until the Warriors tied it up with 2:37 left. Minnesota battled ahead once again but almost let it slip away as they were up by one, when Andrew Wiggins missed two free throws, allowing the Warriors the opportunity to go up by one on the next possession. Wiggins made up for his error though, as he sank two free throws with 12 seconds left to seal the one-point win. 

Andrew Wiggins was the high-point man for the Timberwolves (27-37), as he finished with 24 points on 9-of-21 shooting, in 37 minutes. Karl-Anthony Towns followed up with 23 points on more efficient 10-of-18 shooting, in 38 minutes. This marked Towns' 19th straight game with 20 or more points. Four other players scored in double digits for Minnesota, including Ricky Rubio, who chipped in 17 points and dished 13 assists, in 36 minutes. The T-Wolves go on to face the second night of a back-to-back as they visit Milwaukee on Saturday. 

Klay Thompson led the way for the Warriors (52-13) with a game-high 30 points on 12-of-22 shooting, while Stephen Curry followed up with 26 points, but struggled from deep, where he went 1-of-8, in 35 minutes. The only other player to score in double digits for Golden State was Ian Clark, who added 10 points off the bench. The Warriors have now lost two straight, and face a tough match up in their next contest, when they visit San Antonio on Saturday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Toronto Raptors, 105-99, at Philips Arena on Friday.

This was one of the closest games of the season, as neither team was able to grab a lead larger than eight points. In addition, there were 17 ties and 15 lead changes, as this game came down to the wire. Atlanta's offense was extremely efficient, as they shot 52 percent from the field and 36 percent from three-point range. The Raptors weren't quite as fortunate, as they hit just 40 percent from the field and 16 percent from long distance. Defensive rebounding was a huge key as well, with Atlanta winning that battle, 37-30. 

The Raptors (38-27) battled all game long, but they didn't have enough in the arsenal to pull out a tough road win. DeMar DeRozan did all he could for Toronto, as he led the team with 28 points, eight rebounds and six assists, but shot just 12-of-30 from the field. Serge Ibaka finished with 18 points, three rebounds and two assists before fouling out. Cory Joseph started for Kyle Lowry and provided 15 points, eight assists and four steals. Jonas Valanciunas and DeMarre Carroll combined for 22 points, 19 rebounds, six steals and four blocks in a defensive showcase. On deck for Toronto is a road matchup with the Miami Heat on Saturday. 

The Hawks (36-29) have struggled recently, but a tight win like this is just what they need to get some momentum going. Dennis Schroeder led the team with 26 points, six rebounds and five assists. Paul Millsap contributed 21 points, six rebounds and four assists. Dwight Howard totaled 16 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks on 6-of-9 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. got the start and collected 20 points, two rebounds, six assists and two steals. Atlanta's next matchup is tough, as they play the Memphis Grizzlies on the road on Saturday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Boston Celtics, 119-99, at Pepsi Center on Friday night.

The Nuggets (30-35) were buoyed by the somewhat surprising active statuses of Nikola Jokic (illness) and Danilo Gallinari (vertigo), and both players proved pivotal to the win. Each eclipsed the 20-point mark on the night, leading Denver to a stellar 52.9 percent success rate from the field. That helped them overcome 18 turnovers, as did their defense, which forced the same amount from the Celtics (41-25). The Nuggets also won the rebounding battle handily, outperforming Boston by a 49-33 margin down low.

The Celtics were paced by Isaiah Thomas, who tallied 21 points, five assists, two rebounds and one steal. Avery Bradley posted 16 points, two rebounds, two assists and three steals. Al Horford generated 15 points, five rebounds, two assists and one steal. Jaylen Brown led the second unit with 14 points, two boards and one assist. Marcus Smart was productive in a reserve role as well, generating a typically full stat line of 13 points, seven rebounds, two assists and one steal. 

Wilson Chandler led the way for the Nuggets with 23 points, eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Jokic turned in a 21-point, 10-rebound double that also included seven assists, four steals and one block. Gallinari went for 20 points, five boards, one assist and two steals.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the visiting Brooklyn Nets, 105-96, at American Airlines Center on Friday evening. 

The Nets (11-53) led 26-23 after the first quarter and maintained the three-point lead going into halftime. The Mavericks dominated the second half though, out-scoring the Nets 59-47, to take their fourth straight win and get one step closer to that coveted eighth spot in the West. 

Harrison Barnes led the way for the Mavs with 21 points on 7-of-15 shooting, along with seven rebounds, in 37 minutes. Seth Curry followed up with 18 points, five rebounds and four assists, while Yogi Ferrell added 17 points. Seven players came off the bench for Dallas, including J.J. Barea, who made his return after missing 20 games with a calf injury. Barea finished with nine points, three assists and one rebound, in 14 minutes. The Mavs face the second night of a back-to-back as they face off against the Suns, in Phoenix on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, Isaiah Whitehead led the Nets with a game-high 24 points on 8-of-12 shooting, in only 25 minutes off the bench. Jeremy Lin followed up with 18 points, to go along with five rebounds, three assists and two steals, in 27 minutes. Quincy Acy added 12 points, while the only other player to hit double digits for the Nets was Trevor Booker, who added 15 off the bench. The Nets go on to host the Knicks on Sunday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Sacramento Kings in overtime, 130-122, at Golden 1 Center on Friday night. 

The Wizards' (39-24) prospects looked rather bleak coming into the fourth quarter, as they trailed by a 97-82 margin. However, the light went on at that point for Washington, as they outscored the Kings (25-40) by a 34-19 margin in the final period to force overtime. John Wall gave the Wizards their final lead of regulation by draining a 13-foot basket with 19 seconds remaining, but Willie Cauley-Stein knotted matters up at 116 just four seconds later. Wall's missed 16-footer at the buzzer prompted overtime, and Bradley Beal, who scored a game-high 38 points, 21 which came in the final 17 minutes, gave the visitors the lead for good with a 24-foot three-pointer at the 2:23 mark of the extra period. The game featured outstanding shooting from both squads, as the Wizards tallied a 50 percent success rate from the floor and Sacramento countered with 47.8 percent.

Beal added 10 rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block to his aforementioned scoring total. Wall followed with a 25-point, 12-assist, double-double that also included four rebounds and two steals. Otto Porter, Jr. provided 18 points, six rebounds, two steals, one assist and one block. Markieff Morris turned in 10 points, six boards and two assists, while Bojan Bogdanovic led the bench with 17 points, two rebounds, one assist and one steal. 

Cauley-Stein paced the Kings with a 20-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included three assists and one steal. Buddy Hield and Arron Afflalo supplied matching 18-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds and one assist, and the latter registering two boards and one assist. Darren Collison compiled a 14-point, 10-assist double-double and added two rebounds. Ben McLemore paced the second unit with 11 points and four boards, while Anthony Tolliver turned in 10 points and three rebounds off the bench.

The Wizards continue their Western Conference swing with a Saturday night trip to Portland, while the Kings remain home to tangle with the Denver Nuggets on Saturday evening as well.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 106-101, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Thursday evening. 

LeBron James naturally carries a sizable offensive responsibility on his shoulders under normal circumstances, but that goes up exponentially whenever one of his other fellow ""Big Three"" mates is sidelined. That's currently the case with Kevin Love (knee) out indefinitely, and James has unsurprisingly responded with spectacular production. He was at again Thursday, posting a 29-point, 13-rebound, 10-assist triple-double that also included two steals. However, that wasn't enough for the Cavaliers (42-21) to prevent their losing streak from extending to three games, despite the fact that Kyrie Irving also poured in 27 points. The Pistons (32-33) countered with six double-digit scoring performances, including one from each of the members of their starting five, on their way to a 47.1 percent success rate from the field. Detroit impressively battled back from two notable deficits as well, as they trailed by a 29-22 margin after the first quarter and 80-73 heading into the fourth period.

Irving added five rebounds and three assists to his aforementioned scoring total. Channing Frye was the only other Cleveland player to hit double digits in the scoring column, as he totaled 15 points, nine boards and one steal off the bench. Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert turned in modest stat lines as starters, with the former supplying nine points, seven rebounds and two assists, and the latter registering eight points, one rebound and one assist.

Reggie Jackson, who's struggled with his consistency, led the Pistons with 21 points, five assists, two rebounds and one steal. Andre Drummond provided a 20-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included four assists. Tobias Harris had a near double-double with 15 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope matched Harris' point total and added two assists. Marcus Morris delivered a full stat line with 12 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals. Ish Smith led the bench with 12 points, three rebounds, three assists and one steal.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 114-98, Thursday at FedExForum. 

The Clippers (39-26) maintained control throughout Thursday's contest, as they ultimately entered the fourth and final quarter with a 20-point lead. The convincing victory not only gave Los Angeles their third win in four games, but they also added another game to their lead over the Grizzlies (36-29), who were creeping on them in the Western Conference standings. Surprisingly, it was Austin Rivers off the bench who led the way for the Clippers, scoring a team-high 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 32 minutes. Rivers led the way for what ended up being a very impressive outing for the team's reserves, who managed to score 61 of the team's 114 points Thursday. Additionally, Blake Griffin nearly added a triple-double in just 30 minutes of playing time, as he recorded 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in that time. 

For Memphis, Marc Gasol led the way with 20 points on 8-of-16 shooting, five rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes. The bigger story for the Grizzlies, however, was the poor play of starting point guard Mike Conley, who shot an abysmal 3-of-14 from the field and 0-of-4 from behind the arc en route to scoring 13 points in 36 minutes. As a team, Memphis shot a fairly respectable 46 percent from the field, but in the end, their lackluster defensive effort kept them out of Thursday's contest. 

Up next, the Clippers will head home Saturday to take on the 76ers, while the Grizzlies, who have now lost four in a row, will try to end that streak against the Hawks on Saturday.

The Spurs (50-14) were able to keep it close for a quarter before the Thunder (36-29) managed to slowly build up their lead, quarter by quarter, on their home floor. Oklahoma City was once again led by Russell Westbrook, who recorded his 31st triple-double of the season Thursday with a game-high 23 points, 13 assists and 13 rebounds in 35 minutes. Victor Oladipo added 20 points of his own on 8-of-14 shooting, while the team's bench showed up in an impressive way, accounting for 44 of the team's 92 points. 

For San Antonio, it was a sluggish performance for them as they were playing their third game in four days, and they saw their nine-game win streak come to an end as a result. Kawhi Leonard led the way offensively for the Spurs, although he shot just 6-of-15 from the field en route to scoring 19 points. LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 points of his own to go along with six rebounds, while the only other Spur to score in double figures was Pau Gasol, who came off the bench to score 18 points in 24 minutes. As a team, it was a performance to forget shooting the ball for San Antonio, as they hit just 41.7 percent of their shots from the field Thursday. 

Up next, the Thunder will stay home Saturday to play the Jazz, while the Spurs will look to get back on the right track against the Warriors on Saturday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime, 114-108, at Moda Center on Thursday. 

Despite Portland being a huge favorite headed in, this took an extra session to decide a winner. The Blazers actually led for the majority of the game, as they held the lead for well over 40 minutes and never allowed the Sixers to lead by more than four points. Rebounding was the difference in the game, with Portland winning that battle, 55-44. They also dominated the assist differential, recording 25 assists to Philadelphia's 18. Another key for the Trail Blazers was their ability to draw fouls, as they went 28-of-33 from the free-throw line, while the Sixers took just 20 attempts. 

The Sixers (23-41) have really struggled without Joel Embiid (knee), as they've lost six of their last seven games. Dario Saric continued his Rookie of the Year campaign though, as he led the team with 28 points, nine rebounds and two steals on 11-of-16 shooting. Robert Covington finished second on the team, totaling 24 points, 13 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Jahlil Okafor amassed 16 points and eight rebounds. On deck for the Sixers is a road matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday. 

The Blazers (28-35) continue to battle for the eight-seed in the West, as this victory brought them within a game of the Denver Nuggets. Jusuf Nurkic was a beast, as he led the team with 28 points, 20 rebounds, eight assists and six blocks. Damian Lillard finished with 24 points, four rebounds and four assists. C.J. McCollum accumulated 23 points, four rebounds and three assists. Allen Crabbe was the lone player to score in double figures off the bench, as he provided 18 points off the pine. The Blazers will look to keep rolling on Saturday against the Washington Wizards.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Phoenix Suns, 122-110, at Staples Center on Thursday. 

The Lakers (20-45) picked up their 20th win of the season after D'Angelo Russell buried 28 points on 10-of-20 shooting in a win over the Suns (21-44). Both teams are battling for draft lottery position and only one game separates the two from the bottom of the Western Conference. Los Angeles was consistent on the scoring end through each quarter, scoring no less than 29 points per quarter and no more than 32 points. Defensively, they stunted the Suns in the third quarter, besting them 29-18 in that period, one in which they have struggled through most of this season. 

Russell added four rebounds and three assists, including six three-pointers, which marked a strong bounce-back from his 2-of-6 three-point shooting in the loss to the Mavericks. Rookie Brandon Ingram added 14 points, six boards and three assists, while Jordan Clarkson pitched in 19 points on 7-of-18 shooting off the bench. 

Devin Booker scored 23 points to lead all Suns scorers, and finished 10-of-21 from the field alongside six rebounds and three assists. Eric Bledsoe struggled to find a rhythm, but managed a quality stat line of 13 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. T.J. Warren completed a double-double with 17 points and 13 rebounds, while rookie Marquese Chriss managed 18 points on 3-of-4 shooting from behind the arc. 

Next up, the Suns visit the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday, while the Lakers host the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Chicago Bulls, 98-91, at Amway Center on Wednesday evening.

The Bulls (31-33) were in danger of playing Wednesday's contest without their two most talented players, as Jimmy Butler's (illness) availability suddenly came into question earlier in the day, while Dwyane Wade (thigh) was already ruled out. However, Butler persevered and took the court, posting a team-high 21 points that he supplemented with nine assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. However, with no other player tallying more than 13 points, it wasn't quite enough against a Magic (24-41) squad that had its starting backcourt of Elfrid Payton and Evan Fournier hitting on all cylinders. Orlando put together an excellent defensive effort as well, limiting the Bulls to 14 points in the fourth quarter and eliciting 16 turnovers from them. 

Jerian Grant was second on the Bulls with the aforementioned 13-point total, and he added five rebounds, two assists and one steal. Cristiano Felicio posted a bench-leading 11 points that he supplemented with two rebounds and one assist. Robin Lopez contributed a near double-double of 10 points, nine rebounds, one assist and two blocks. Rajon Rondo (ankle), who had initially been deemed to be a game-time decision, took the floor and supplied eight points, six assists, five rebounds and one block in 28 minutes off the bench.

Payton paced the Magic with a spectacular 22-point, 14-rebound, 14-assist triple-double that also included two steals and two blocks. Fournier nearly accomplished a double-double himself with 20 points, nine boards, two assists and two steals. Terrence Ross registered 14 points, three rebounds and one assist. Aaron Gordon went for 13 points, four rebounds and two steals. Jeff Green led the second unit with nine points, five boards, two assists and one steal.

The Bulls return home to tangle with the Houston Rockets on Friday night, while the Magic travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Friday evening as well.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 110-105, at Philips Arena on Wednesday evening. 

The Nets (11-52) may sport the ugliest record in the NBA, but their play continues to embody the scrappiness and never-say-die underdog attitude of the borough they call home. Brooklyn gave yet another quality team in the Hawks (35-29) all they could handle Wednesday, with Atlanta finally putting the game away on a pair of Dennis Schroder free throws with two seconds remaining. The Nets rather amazingly overcame 22 turnovers by a solid 46.3 percent from the floor and 80 percent from the free-throw line, and getting a total of 55 points from a very productive second unit.

Sean Kilpatrick was one of those reserves with the hot hand, as he led the Nets with 27 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal. Brook Lopez was next with 18 points, six rebounds, three assists, five blocks and one steal. Jeremy Lin produced his best game since returning from a prolonged absence with a hamstring ailment, supplying 16 points, eight assists, three rebounds and one steal. Trevor Booker registered 12 points, eight boards, three assists, one steal and one block in 27 minutes off the bench.

Schroder scored a game-high 31 points that he supplemented with five assists, two rebounds and three steals. Paul Millsap tallied 24 points, four rebounds, three assists and two blocks. Tim Hardaway, Jr. continued his solid stretch of play on the second unit, posting a bench-leading 16 points that he supplemented with six boards and two steals. Dwight Howard provided one of his trademark double-doubles, collecting 11 points, 14 rebounds, two assists, two blocks and one steal. Ersan Ilyasova supplied 10 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals in 26 minutes off the bench.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks, 104-93, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Wednesday. 

These are two teams going in opposite directions and Milwaukee showed just which way in this win. While there were only two ties and four lead changes in total, neither team led by more than 12 points. It took a second half run for Milwaukee to win, as they outscored the Knicks, 49-37, in the second half. Their ability to get to the free-throw line was huge, with the Bucks going 22-of-28 from the charity stripe, while New York hit just 8-of-12. Turnovers were a huge impact, with the Knicks committing 16 turnovers to the Bucks eight. Fastbreak points and scoring in the paint were a huge difference as well, combining to win those categories, 70-36.

The Knicks (26-39) have just four wins in their last 11 games, as they continue to slide down the standings. Derrick Rose had his best shooting game of the season though, scoring 26 points on 13-of-16 shooting. Carmelo Anthony accumulated 16 points, four rebounds and three assists. Kristaps Porzingis collected 13 points, eight rebounds and three blocks. Willy Hernangomez did commit six turnovers, but amassed 13 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out. On deck for New York is a road matchup with the Detroit Pistons on Saturday. 

The Bucks (30-33) are now 8-3 across their last 11 games, which has catapulted them into the playoffs. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee, as he tallied 32 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. Khris Middleton finished second on the team, totaling 18 points, three rebounds and four assists. Greg Monroe was a huge spark off the bench, providing 17 points, eight rebounds and three assists.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans, 94-87, at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday.

Despite there being just four ties and 11 lead changes in this game, it was close throughout. In fact, neither team led by more than 10 points, as it came down to the final seconds. Three-point shooting was the only real difference, as New Orleans went just 9-of-29, while Toronto went 8-of-21. The statistics were unbelievably close, as rebounding, assists, steals, blocks and turnovers were all within two of one another. 

The Raptors (38-26) are 5-2 since the All-Star break, as they continue to patch things together without Kyle Lowry. Jonas Valanciunas was the star, as he accrued 25 points and 13 rebounds to lead Toronto. DeMar DeRozan finished second on the team, collecting 14 points and six assists. Serge Ibaka totaled 12 points, five rebounds, two steals and four blocks. On deck for Toronto is a road matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday. 

The Pelicans (25-40) are now just 1-6 in games with DeMarcus Cousins, as they simply can't find any rhythm. Cousins did lead the team in scoring, though, tallying 25 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two blocks. Anthony Davis totaled just seven points and four rebounds, as he left after 17 minutes with a wrist injury. Jordan Crawford played well off the bench in his second game with New Orleans, as he provided 10 points, three rebounds and three assists. New Orleans will play the Charlotte Hornets for their next game on Saturday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Houston Rockets, 115-108, at Toyota Center on Wednesday.

In a battle between two Western Conference contenders, the Jazz were able to escape with a huge road win. It was a dominating showing from Utah, as they led for 46 minutes in a near wire-to-wire win. Rebounding was a huge factor in the win for the Jazz, as they won that battle, 45-31. Shooting was also a big difference, as Utah hit 54 percent of their shots to Houston's 44 percent. The Rockets three-point shooting left them down too, as they went just 8-of-32 from long distance. 

The Jazz (41-24) had to play this game without Derrick Favors (knee) and George Hill (toe), but they still escaped with an impressive road win. Gordon Hayward tallied 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Rudy Gobert also scored 23 points, adding 10 rebounds on 7-of-8 shooting. Rodney Hood finished third on the team, accruing 19 points and six rebounds. Joe Johnson got a rare start and provided 16 points, two rebounds and two assists. On deck for Utah is a road matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday. 

The Rockets (44-21) had won eight of 11 headed into this game, but a date with this Jazz defense is one of the toughest in the league. James Harden did all he could for Houston, totaling 35 points, four rebounds and six assists. Clint Capela recorded a double-double, amassing 19 points and 12 rebounds. Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell each scored 12 points off the bench. Houston will look to bounce back on Friday in a road matchup with the Chicago Bulls.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 107-91, at Target Center on Wednesday evening. 

The Timberwolves (26-37) boast some of the most exciting young talent in the league, but have consistently found defense to be their Achilles' heel. However, they found a way to impressively reverse course Wednesday, styming a talented Clippers (38-26) squad at full strength and goading them into an uncharacteristic 16 turnovers. Minnesota ambushed their visitors to the tune of a 31-19 lead after one quarter, before Los Angeles made up some ground before halftime with a 36-point explosion of their own in the second period. However, the Timberwolves effectively put the game away  in the third, outscoring the Clippers by a double-digit margin a second time, 24-13. That left them with a comfortable 82-68 lead heading into the final 12 minutes, one they were able to sustain without much struggle. 

DeAndre Jordan led the way for Los Angeles with a 20-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included one assist and one block. Blake Griffin provided 16 points, four rebounds and two assists. J.J. Redick turned in 14 points, one rebound, one assist, two steals and one block. Marreese Speights led the second unit with 12 points and six rebounds, while Austin Rivers totaled 10 points, three assists, two rebounds and one block off the bench as well. Chris Paul had an off night shooting (3-9 FG), but he managed to add 10 assists, three rebounds and one steal to his seven points.

Karl-Anthony Towns once again paced the Timberwolves, generating a 29-point, 14-rebound double-double and adding two assists, all over just 27 minutes. Andrew Wiggins overcame a 5-for-17 shooting night with a perfect 10-for-10 tally from the free-throw line to compile 20 points. He added three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Shabazz Muhammad drew a rather rare start and went for 17 points, six rebounds and one steal. Ricky Rubio managed a 15-point, 12-assist double-double that also included six rebounds and two steals. Gorgui Dieng chipped in a modest seven points but also provided nine rebounds, two assists, four steals and two blocks.

The Clippers will try to put the loss behind them quickly, as they have a Thursday night road showdown on tap with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Timberwolves remain home to tangle with the Golden State Warriors on Friday night.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 115-98, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday evening. 

The Pacers (33-31) have had difficulty finding any measure of consistency overall, with one notable exception -- their performance at home. Indiana had managed a 21-10 record at Bankers Life Fieldhouse heading into Wednesday, and the trend of superior play in their familiar digs held true once again versus the Pistons (31-33). Paul George led the way with 21 points, 13 of which came in the third quarter, eight rebounds and two assists over 29 minutes, while five other Pacers also posted double digits in the scoring column. It was an outstanding shooting night all around for Indiana, as they posted respective success rates of 50 percent and 47.8 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively.

Tobias Harris paced Detroit with 22 points off the bench, which he supplemented with five rebounds and one assist. Stanley Johnson was next with 17 points, five rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block off the second unit as well. Jon Leuer tallied 15 points, four rebounds and one assist. Andre Drummond turned in a 14-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included one assist and two steals. Marcus Morris supplied 10 points, two assists, one rebound and one block.

Thaddeus Young snapped a five-game streak of single-digit scoring efforts by checking in second behind George with 18 points, eight rebounds and one steal. C.J. Miles was next with 15 points, two assists and one rebound. Monta Ellis led the bench with 12 points and three assists over just 14 minutes. Glenn Robinson III was right behind him, registering 11 points, four rebounds and only one steal in just eight minutes. Jeff Teague provided 10 points, six assists and five rebounds. 

The Pistons make the quick trip back home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday evening, while the Pacers travel to Milwaukee to face off with the Bucks on Friday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Sacramento Kings, 114-104, Wednesday at AT&T Center. 

The Spurs (50-13) elected to rest stars Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge for the night, and their impact, or lack thereof, could be felt in the first quarter, as San Antonio fell behind by 22 points after the first 12 minutes of the game and ultimately went into halftime facing a 15-point deficit. However, the second half was a much different story, as the Spurs ended up winning the second 24 minutes by an astonishing 25 points to bury the visiting Kings (25-39).

Without the two stars, Manu Ginobili managed to turn back the clock and lead the way scoring for San Antonio, recording 19 points, five assists, four rebounds and three steals in 25 minutes off the bench. Patty Mills shined off the bench as well, recording 17 points and 10 assists in 27 minutes as a reserve. David Lee also took advantage of the extended playing time, recording a double-double of 18 points on 8-of-9 shooting and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes as a member of the starting lineup. 

As for the Kings, Tyreke Evans shined in his first start since being traded, scoring a game-high 26 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field. There weren't many other highlights from what turned out to be a disappointing performance from Sacramento, but rookie big man Skal Labissiere continues to show his potential, as he recorded an efficient 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting from the field in 15 minutes off the bench Wednesday.

Up next, the Spurs will look to extend their winning streak to 10 games in Oklahoma City on Thursday, while the Kings will look to bounce back and end their six-game losing streak Friday against the Wizards.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Denver Nuggets, 123-113, Wednesday at Pepsi Center. 

The Wizards (39-24), who have now won three straight road games to improve their record away from home to 13-15, won Wednesday's matchup in fairly effortless fashion, as they opened up the game early and went into halftime with a 17-point lead. That was thanks in large part to an incredibly hot shooting performance from Washington, as they shot 56.8 percent from the field and 42.3 percent from behind the arc. The Wizards were once again led by a pair of great performances from their starting backcourt, with John Wall posting a game-high 30 points and 10 assists, while Bradley Beal scored 23 points of his own. The two shot a combined 21-of-36 (58.3 percent) from the field. 

For the Nuggets (29-35), Wednesday's defeat marked their second loss in their last three games, and it was thanks in large part to their lack of defense, as Denver was pretty solid on the offensive side of the ball. As a team, the Nuggets shot 53 percent from the field and a scorching 46.4 percent from behind the arc, but the 123 points they gave up ended up being too much to overcome. Gary Harris led the way for Denver, shooting 10-of-15 from the field and 6-of-9 from behind the arc en route to scoring a game-high 26 points. Wilson Chandler added 21 points of his own, while Mason Plumlee added 19 points and 10 rebounds for a double-double.

Up next, the Wizards will head to Sacramento on Friday to take on the Kings, while the Nuggets will head home Friday and play the Celtics.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Golden State Warriors, 99-86, Wednesday at Oracle Arena.

The game remained tight throughout Wednesday's contest, with two points separating the teams as they entered the final period. It was at that point, however, where the Celtics (41-24) turned it on and ended up running away with the game. Courtesy of a 15-0 run over three minutes and a 21-7 run overall to end the game, Boston was able to dominate the Warriors (52-12) 27-12 in the fourth quarter. And they didn't need any heroics from Isaiah Thomas to do so, as the point guard scored just seven points in the final 12 minutes. Thomas did, however, finish with a team-high 25 points in 34 minutes, but the team's most valuable performance Wednesday came off the bench from Kelly Olynyk, who scored 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting in 26 minutes as a reserve. 

As for the Warriors, it was a fourth quarter to forget. More specifically, it was a fourth quarter to forget for the reigning two-time MVP Stephen Curry, who was 0-for-1 from the field and committed two turnovers in the five minutes he managed to play in the final period. Curry still finished with 23 points on 8-of-16 shooting from the field to go along with six assists and five rebounds, while Klay Thompson added a team-high 25 points on 11-of-23 shooting. In the end, however, Golden State's 17 turnovers, four of which occurred in the last seven minutes of the game, were too much for them to overcome late.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 126-121, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Tuesday evening.

The Thunder (35-29) were playing their fourth game in six nights Tuesday, but Russell Westbrook simply seems immune to the concept of fatigue. In a season of superhuman efforts, the perennial All-Star even outdid himself against the Trail Blazers (27-35), scoring a career-high 58 points to go along with nine assists, three rebounds, three steals and one block. He took an astounding 39 shots from the field, draining 21 of them. By comparison, the next highest-scoring player on Oklahoma City, backcourt mate Victor Oladipo, put up a modest nine attempts and scored 16 points. However, despite the herculean performance, a balanced Portland squad that saw seven players hit double digits in the scoring column was able to pull out the hard-fought road win. The second unit was particularly key, combining for 49 points overall. 

A trio of guards paced the Blazers, with reserve Allen Crabbe surprisingly at the top of the list. He managed 23 points, four rebounds and two assists over 28 minutes. Damian Lillard followed with 22 points, eight assists, three rebounds and one steal. C.J. McCollum poured in 21 points and added a pair of boards. Jusuf Nurkic contributed 17 points, eight rebounds, four assists and one steal. Al-Farouq Aminu continued his recent stretch of strong play off the bench, submitting 12 points, seven rebounds, three blocks and one steal. Meyers Leonard matched Aminu's point total and added one rebound and one assist. Noah Vonleh chipped in with 11 points, five rebounds and two assists in a start at power forward.

Oladipo added five rebounds to his aforementioned scoring total. Enes Kanter was the only other player in double digits on OKC, posting 11 points, seven rebounds and one assist over 18 minutes. Andre Roberson managed nine points and six boards, while Domantas Sabonis chipped in with eight points and four boards. 

The Trail Blazers head back home to tangle with the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday evening, while the Thunder are home against the San Antonio Spurs on the same night.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 122-111, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday. 

All the talk around this game will be around Dirk Nowitzki and rightfully so. Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 30,000 points, as he did it with a patented Nowitzki fade away. That feat came in a relatively easy win too, as it was a wire-to-wire victory for Dallas, with them leading by double-digits for the final 35 minutes. The Mavericks actually took a 29-point lead into the fourth quarter, but the Los Angeles starters used that garbage time to cut it to a respectable scoreline. Dallas was lights out from the field, as they shot 52 percent from the field and 55 percent from three-point range. The Mavericks also thrived off turnovers, winning the points off turnover differential, 29-14. 

The Lakers (19-45) have been one of the worst teams in the league over recent months and this loss was much worse than it looks in the box score. Julius Randle was a bright spot, as he accumulated 13 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists en route to a triple-double. D'Angelo Russell led the starters with 22 points, four assists and four steals. Jordan Clarkson led the bench, as he provided 22 points and two assists. The Lakers will return to action on Thursday in a road matchup against the Phoenix Suns. 

The Mavericks (27-36) now find themselves within two games of the eight-seed in the West and wins like this show just how hard they're fighting for that spot. Nowitzki not only reached the 30,000-point threshold, he scored a game-high 25 points to go along with 11 rebounds. Seth Curry finished second on the team, collecting 18 points, two rebounds and five assists. Yogi Ferrell finished with 16 points and seven assists, while Harrison Barnes accrued 14 points and six rebounds. Nerlens Noel came off the bench to amass 11 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. Dallas will look to keep rolling on Friday against the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Phoenix Suns, 131-127, Tuesday at Talking Stick Resort Arena.

It was a back-and-forth game between these teams, as after the Wizards (38-24) opened up the game early with a 13-point lead after one quarter, the Suns (21-43) chipped away and ultimately opened up their own lead of 11 points in the third quarter. From there, after Washington countered, the game was neck and neck until the very end. With two minutes to go, the Wizards gained a 10-point lead, which then dropped to an eight-point lead with 30 seconds left. Phoenix's Devin Booker wouldn't let his team go away, however, and managed to score nine points over the next 26 seconds, but ultimately, it was not enough, and the Suns couldn't extend their win streak to four games. 

The Washington backcourt led the way all night for the Wizards, as Bradley Beal scored 27 points in 33 minutes, while John Wall notched 25 points and 14 assists in 37 minutes. The most important for Washington, however, came from one of their newest members, as Bojan Bogdanovic scored a team-high 29 points in 29 minutes off the bench. Most of those came at the free throw line, as Bogdanovic hit an impressive 16-of-16 shots from the charity stripe.

It was a similar story for the Suns, as the starting backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Devin Booker carried the team to the bitter end. Bledsoe finished with a game-high 30 points on 50 percent shooting in just 27 minutes. Booker, after his late-game spurt, scored 25 points to go along with six assists and four rebounds in 38 minutes. As a team, Phoenix shot very well, as they hit 50 percent of their shots overall from the field. In the end, it was their carelessness with the basketball that resulted in 19 team turnovers that cost them Tuesday's outing.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 112-98, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday night.

The Bucks (29-33) got off to a fast start in the first half, forging a 60-43 lead by halftime. Six players tallied double digits in the scoring column and Milwaukee posted respective success rates of 49.4 percent from the field and 42.4 percent from three-point range. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tony Snell led the way with a combined 45 points, while the Sixers (23-40) hurt their own cause with an 8-for-30 effort from three-point range and a subpar 63.2 percent tally from the free-throw line.

Antetokounmpo provided 24 points, eight rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two steals to lead Milwaukee. Snell followed with 21 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Malcolm Brogdon and Khris Middleton offered matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block, and the latter supplying eight assists, five rebounds and one block. Greg Monroe paced the second unit with 12 points and two rebounds, while Matthew Delladedova turned in 10 points, seven assists and three boards.

Justin Anderson paced the Sixers with 19 points, six boards and three assists. Robert Covington totaled 15 points, three boards, two blocks and one steal. Dario Saric provided a full line of 14 points, eight rebounds, six assists and two steals. Richaun Holmes managed eight points and nine rebounds in a start for Jahlil Okafor (knee). T.J. McConnell mustered only two points but did dish out eight assists.

The Bucks head back home for a Wednesday night showdown with the Knicks, while the Sixers head to Portland for a Thursday evening tilt against the Trail Blazers.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Orlando Magic, 113-105, at Amway Center on Monday evening.

The Knicks (26-38) had announced earlier in the day that Carmelo Anthony would sit out the second game of the back-to-back set with knee soreness, which created a domino effect that saw rookie Ron Baker enter the starting five. His absence naturally put more of a scoring load on the likes of Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee, and each responded with solid contributions to help New York to a road win. The Knicks made a comeback after the Magic (23-41) had built a 28-20 lead after one quarter, and did it once more in the fourth in overcoming a 92-85 deficit to pull away for the eight-point victory. The win snapped an 11-game losing streak for the Knicks in games in which Anthony had not taken the court.

Lee led the way with 20 points, three rebounds, two assists and one steal. Lance Thomas continued his strong play with 17 points, four boards, two steals and one assist. Porzingis supplied 14 points, seven rebounds, one assist and one block. Willy Hernangomez matched his scoring total and added eight rebounds and three assists in just 18 minutes off the bench. Rose compiled 12 points, six assists and five rebounds, and Kyle O'Quinn registered 11 points, eight boards and one assist. Justin Holiday was solid as a reserve with 10 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals.

Evan Fournier paced Orlando with a game-high 25 points, which he supplemented with three assists and two rebounds. Aaron Gordon tallied 17 points, five rebounds, four assists and one block. Elfrid Payton posted a 16-point, 11-rebound, 10-assist triple-double that also included one steal. Bismack Biyombo, logging a second straight start in place of Nikola Vucevic (Achilles), provided a second consecutive double-double with 10 points, 14 rebounds and one block. Jeff Green paced the bench with 15 points, one rebound and one block.

The Knicks remain on the road and face off with the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night, while the Magic are home again Wednesday evening as they take on the Chicago Bulls.

												The Miami Heat defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 106-98, at Quicken Loans Arena on Monday. 

Miami is one of the hottest teams in the league right now and they showed Cleveland just that in this surprising win. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the decisive statistic, with the Heat recording 23 assists to seven turnovers, while the Cavaliers committed 17 turnovers to just 15 assists. Three-point shooting was a big key as well, with Miami hitting 16-of-35 from long distance, while Cleveland went just 9-of-27. The Cavaliers did dominate the rebounding though, winning that battle, 52-38. It was a near wire-to-wire win for Miami, as they led for the final 40-plus minutes.

The Heat (30-34) continue to be one of the hottest teams in the league, as this marks their 19th win in 23 games. Dion Waiters was the star, as he led the team with 29 points and five assists. Goran Dragic wasn't far behind, totaling 21 points and six assists. Hassan Whiteside recorded a double-double, amassing 13 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks. Wayne Ellington was huge off the bench, providing 18 points, four rebounds and four assists. On deck for Miami is a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday. 

The Cavaliers (42-20) have now lost four of their last six games, with this loss being one of the worst of that stretch. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving carried the load, as they combined for 62 points, 24 rebounds and nine assists. Irving led the team, accumulating 32 points, seven rebounds and three assists. James finished with 30 points, 17 rebounds and six assists. Andrew Bogut made his debut with the Cavs, but broke his leg in one minute of action. Cleveland will be off until Thursday, when they play the Detroit Pistons on the road.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 119-111, at Phillips Arena on Monday evening. 

The Warriors (52-11) are continuing to find their way without Kevin Durant (knee), and they may be starting to hit their stride. After a rough first full game without their All-Star last Thursday against the Bulls, Golden State bounced back with a much better effort in a Sunday victory against the Knicks. They had a much tougher test in front of them Monday in the form of the Hawks (34-29), but managed a second straight win on the strength of matching 24-point efforts from Stephen Curry and Andre Iguodala, as well a 19-turnover tally on Atlanta's part. 

Curry added nine assists and four rebounds. Iguodala also supplied five rebounds, four assists, three steals and one block in 35 minutes on the second unit. Klay Thompson contributed 13 points, three assists and one block. Draymond Green filled out the stat sheet with 12 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four steals. David West and Ian Clark each poured in 10 points off the bench, while Matt Barnes contributed five points, seven rebounds, three assists and one block over 18 minutes in his third game in a Warriors uniform. 

Dennis Schroder paced the Hawks with 23 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal. Paul Millsap posted a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and one block. Tim Hardaway, Jr. led the bench with 19 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Kent Bazemore managed 18 points, one rebound and one block. Ersan Ilyasova was productive off the bench as well with 15 points, two rebounds, three steals and one block over 27 minutes. Dwight Howard pitched in with a modest eight points but hauled in a whopping 19 rebounds and recorded one block. 

The Warriors head back home and await the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night, while the Hawks remain home to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Chicago Bulls, 109-95, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday. 

Despite Chicago leading for the majority of the first three quarters, Detroit made this look like a blowout in the fourth. In fact, Chicago rode a 30-16 fourth quarter to a 14-point win, despite trailing by 12 after the first quarter. Rebounding was a huge factor, with the Pistons winning that battle, 48-37. They also took care of the ball, recording five more assists than Chicago, while committing four less turnovers. A 58-32 scoring in the paint advantage was huge for Detroit as well. 

The Bulls (31-32) had to play this game without Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo, as they simply didn't have enough bullets in the arsenal for this matchup. Jimmy Butler carried the load, as he collected 27 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Robin Lopez finished second on the team, totaling 18 points and four rebounds, while Cameron Payne was the only other Bull with more than 10 points, as he provided 14 points, three rebounds and three assists off the bench. On deck for Chicago is a road matchup with the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.

The Pistons (31-32) need to win some games to maintain the eight-seed in the East and a comeback like this can only give them momentum going forward. Reggie Jackson was the hero, as he scored 24 of his team-leading 26 points in the second half to spark the comeback. He also handed out six assists, while going 11-of-16 from the field. Jon Leuer finished with 16 points and six rebounds, while Marcus Morris amassed 13 points and six rebounds of his own. Tobias Harris and Aron Baynes combined for 25 points, 15 rebounds and five assists coming off the bench. Detroit will be on the road for their next game, as they play the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies, 122-109, at FedEx Forum on Monday.

This looked like an easy win for Memphis on paper, but Brooklyn had other ideas with this shocking win. The Nets really took it to the Grizzlies in the fourth quarter, winning it, 34-18. Shooting was key, with Brooklyn hitting 53 percent from the field and 47 percent from three-point range. Memphis only shot 44 percent from the field and 40 percent from three. The 12 steals and five blocks from Brooklyn was huge as well, as Memphis could only muster up seven steals and two blocks. 

The Nets (11-51) have easily turned into the worst team in the league and this win over a gritty Grizzlies bunch is a shocking one to say the least. Sean Kilpatrick led Brooklyn, as he provided 23 points, five rebounds and three assists off the bench. Jeremy Lin led the starters with 18 points and four rebounds. Caris LeVert and Randy Foye scored 14 points apiece in starting roles, while Brook Lopez totaled just eight points and four rebounds. On deck for the Nets is a road matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday. 

The Grizzlies (36-28) are now below .500 across their last 11 games, with this loss being the worst of the season. Mike Conley did all he could for Memphis, as he accumulated 32 points, three rebounds and six assists. Marc Gasol finished second on the team, collecting 18 points, six rebounds, four assists and two blocks.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Indiana Pacers, 100-88, Monday at Spectrum Center. 

The Hornets (27-35) won their second straight game in convincing fashion after opening up an 11-point lead by the end of the first quarter and never letting go of the lead. Kemba Walker lead the way with yet another great all-around performance, scoring a game-high 28 points on 10-of-22 shooting from the field to go along with seven assists and six rebounds in 35 minutes. Nicolas Batum wasn't too far behind, scoring 21 points in 43 minutes. In the end, however, it was Charlotte's defensive effort that guided them to victory, as the team tallied up 10 steals and forced the opposition into 15 total turnovers. 

Their opposition, the Pacers (32-30), struggled mightily offensively outside of their star Paul George, who finished with a game-high 36 points on 15-of-25 shooting from the field, 10 rebounds and five assists in 36 minutes. Unfortunately for Indiana, those 36 points were nearly half of the team's total points, and his teammates were ice cold from the field. Outside of George, the Pacers shot 22-of-56 (39 percent) from the field, and their inability to support their start ultimately cost them Monday's game.

Up next, the Hornets will travel to Miami on Wednesday to take on the surging Heat, while the Pacers will look to bounce back Wednesday against the Pistons.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Houston Rockets, 112-110, Monday at AT&T Center.

The game didn't take long to get out of hand, as the Rockets (44-20) opened up a 16-point lead in the first quarter and looked to be well on their way to a big road victory. Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs (49-13), however, had different plans. San Antonio slowly chipped away at the lead over the next three quarters. In the end, it was a sequence that included a go-ahead three-pointer, a block on a James Harden layup and a pair of game-clinching free throws, all from Leonard, that ended Monday's contest. Leonard finished with a team-high 39 points on an impressive 12-of-18 shooting from the field to go along with six rebounds and five assists in 39 minutes. Additionally, what was key for the Spurs was Tony Parker's ability to slip out of a funk, as after three straight games in single digits, Parker finished with 19 points, six rebounds and three assists. 

As for Houston, James Harden was once again sensational, scoring 39 points on 12-of-20 shooting from the field and dishing out a game-high 12 assists in 36 minutes. In contrast, Lou Williams had a dreadful night from the field, hitting just 1-of-10 shots en route to scoring five points, and the favorite to win Sixth Man of the Year has now had three straight games where he has failed to score in double figures. In the end, five Rockets players managed to score in double figures, but it wasn't enough to end the Spurs' seven-game win streak.

Up next, San Antonio will look to extend their streak to nine games against the Kings on Wednesday, while the Rockets will look to bounce back against the Jazz at home Wednesday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 108-96, at Pepsi Center on Monday. 

The Nuggets (29-34) flexed the depth of their team as they picked up a home victory without Nikola Jokic, Emmanuel Mudiay or Roy Hibbert. Wilson Chandler dropped 36 points to lead all scorers in the impressive effort, draining 13-of-23 shots and adding 12 rebounds and four assists in the win. Denver peaked in the third quarter with 33 points and went into the fourth quarter with a 17-point lead that they did not have to look back on. 

Aside from Chandler, the Nuggets saw a solid outing from Danilo Gallinari, who scored 18 points on an efficient 5-of-7 shooting across 31 minutes of action. The bench only stretched four players deep, with Will Barton leading the scoring with a lowly nine points in 27 minutes. Mason Plumlee pitched in a double-double with 10 points and 12 boards, while Gary Harris added 15 points, three rebounds and three assists. 

The Kings shot just 43.4 percent from the field as a unit and saw a sporadic use of different lineups throughout the contest. Opposed to the starters' heavy minutes put on the Nuggets, the Kings used six bench players, most of which saw over 20 minutes of action. Darren Collison led the Kings' scorers with 17 points, to go with two boards and five assists. Kosta Koufos contributed 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Buddy Hield had 14 points on 4-of-7 shooting including 2-of-2 from three-point range. 

Next up, the Kings visit the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, while the Nuggets play the same day and host the Washington Wizards.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 88-83, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday. 

The Jazz (40-24) picked up their 40th win of the season and continue to rise in the Western Conference behind stellar play from Rudy Gobert. The elite center for Utah tipped in the buzzer beater for the win over the Kings on Sunday, and came up with another ridiculous stat line on Monday, as he finished with 15 points, 15 rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks across 36 minutes of action. 

The Pelicans simply could not find a rhythm shooting the ball, and finished with a season worst 35.7 percent as a unit. They allowed multiple Jazz scoring runs and did not have a single lead throughout the entirety of the game. The Pelicans picked up their first win with DeMarcus Cousins on Sunday, but were unable to do the same on the second game of a back-to-back. Cousins finished with 15 points, eight boards and three assists on 5-of-15 shooting, while Anthony Davis added 20 points and 12 rebounds across 37 minutes. 

The Jazz were led in scoring by Gordon Hayward, who finished with 23 points on 10-of-20 shooting. He was the only efficient scorer amongst the starters, as Utah finished just 40.7 percent shooting from the field as a team. 

Next up, the Jazz visit the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Pelicans play the same day when they host the Toronto Raptors.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Boston Celtics, 116-102, at Staples Center on Monday. 

The Clippers (38-25) needed to sub in the likes of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin late in the fourth quarter after Brad Steven's testy defensive unit was able to compete down the stretch. The last four minutes added some drama after Jamal Crawford and DeAndre Jordan hooked up time and time again to put the Clippers up as many as 16 points with under 7:00 minutes remaining in the final period. Paul and Griffin were sitting on the bench late, leaving the game in the hands of Raymond Felton and Crawford, and both players had body parts wrapped in ice. Los Angeles has had trouble closing out games this season, but even a motivated Celtics (40-24) squad without Al Horford (elbow) was not able to overcome the deficit. 

Chris Paul and Blake Griffin did their damage early, and went on to finish with 23 points and 26 points, respectively. Paul added five rebounds and four assists, while Griffin contributed eight boards and five dimes. Crawford missed his first five shots from the field, but went on to sink the next five and finished with 19 points and five assists. DeAndre Jordan also grabbed most of his points late, and added 15 points and 12 boards in the win. 

Isaiah Thomas led the Celtics and all scorers with 32 points, to go with five assists and three steals, while Avery Bradley pitched in 14 points. Marcus Smart was the next most effective Boston player on the floor, and added 21 points in 32 minutes off the bench, to go with three rebounds, three assists and one steal. 

Next up, the Celtics visit the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Clippers play the same night and visit the Minnesota Timberwolves.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 97-96, at Phillips Arena on Sunday afternoon. 

The contest had a couple of intriguing sub-plots coming in, as Pacers point guard Jeff Teague was making his return to the city where he'd played his first seven seasons, and Hawks head coach Mike Budenholzer was suspended for the game for making contact with a referee during Friday night's 135-130 loss to the Cavaliers. The actual contest exceeded expectations, as the Pacers (32-30) roared back from a 30-19 deficit after one quarter to forge a 50-50 tie by halftime. The two teams traded punches throughout the second half before Indiana mounted an exciting comeback over the final 1:43. Down 96-90 after a Paul Millsap 12-foot driving floating jump shot, Teague and C.J. Miles each drained baskets, setting up a 23-foot three-pointer from the left corner by 2017 Slam Dunk champion Glenn Robinson with 0.6 seconds remaining for the one-point victory. 

Paul George led Indiana with 34 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds and four assists. Teague was a distant second with 16 points, six assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block. Miles followed with 13 points, five rebounds and two assists. Robinson led the bench with 11 points, four boards, one assist, one steal and one block. Thaddeus Young and Myles Turner notably struggled, combining for just nine points on 4-of-12 shooting. 

Tim Hardaway, Jr. paced the Hawks (34-28) with 24 points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal in 35 minutes off the bench, but missed a 25-foot three-point attempt with 10 seconds remaining and Atlanta hanging on to a 96-94 lead. Millsap led the first unit with a 23-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two steals. Dennis Schroder tallied 18 points, seven assists, one rebound and three steals. Thabo Sefolosha pitched in with a full line of 12 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals. Dwight Howard mustered a modest nine points but brought down 14 rebounds and also recorded three assists, two steals and one block.

The Pacers next head to Charlotte to tangle with the Hornets on Monday night, while the Hawks remain home for their own Monday evening showdown with the Golden State Warriors.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the New York Knicks, 112-105, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon.

Coming into Sunday, the Warriors (51-11) were looking to reestablish their confidence after falling flat in their first game without Kevin Durant (knee) on Thursday. The prolific Splash Bros made sure of that, putting together a performance that hearkened back to last season by combining for 60 points, including nine three-pointers. No other player on the team scored more than 13 but it proved to be enough to hold off a feisty Knicks (25-38) squad that kept matters close until the closing minute. New York got a pair of standout performances in their own right from Derrick Rose and Kristaps Porzingis, who nearly matched Curry and Thompson basket-for-basket with 53 combined points of their own. The Warriors notably lost the rebound battle by a 47-35 margin, but took much better care of the ball, turning it over only eight times as compared the Knicks' 15.

Curry led the way with a game-high 31 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, six assists and two steals. Thompson was right behind him with 29 points, four boards, one assist and one steal. Green filled out the stat sheet with 13 points, seven rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block. Zaza Pachulia provided 10 points, two assists, one rebound, one steal and one block. 

Rose paced the Knicks with 28 points on 9-of-18 shooting from the floor and a 10-of-11 tally from the free-throw line. He added four assists, one rebound and one steal. Porzingis compiled a 24-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two blocks. With his two teammates taking on such expanded roles Sunday, Carmelo Anthony turned in a rather modest 15 points, six rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Lance Thomas surprisingly went scoreless over 27 minutes, although he did supply seven boards and two assists. Justin Holiday led the bench with 10 points, three rebounds and one assist. 

The Warriors now head south to the Peach State for a Monday night showdown with the Atlanta Hawks, while the Knicks travel to Central Florida to tangle with the Orlando Magic on Monday evening as well.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Boston Celtics, 109-106, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday. 

Boston appeared to be the heavy favorite on paper, but Phoenix has been a much better team over recent weeks. The fourth quarter was especially tight, as there were five ties and eight lead changes alone in the fourth quarter. It was a hectic last 15 seconds, as Phoenix hit a lay-up with 12 seconds left to tie and then recorded a steal to eventually win on a game-winning three at the buzzer by Tyler Ulis. Defense was key for the Suns, as they held the Celtics to 38 percent shooting, while winning the turnover battle. Scoring in the paint was a huge factor as well, with Phoenix winning that battle, 52-32. 

The Celtics (40-23) had to play this game without Al Horford and Avery Bradley, as they didn't have enough bullets in the arsenal to hold off the Suns. Isaiah Thomas carried the load, as he tallied 35 points, two rebounds, five assists and two steals. Jae Crowder finished second on the team, totaling 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown and Amir Johnson scored 13 points apiece. Terry Rozier led the bench with 14 points and four rebounds. On deck for Boston is a road matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday. 

The Suns (21-42) achieved their first three-game winning streak of them season with this victory, as this stretch gives them some hope for the future. Eric Bledsoe was the star, as he collected 28 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Tyler Ulis provided 20 points and five assists off the bench, including the game-winning three. Alan Williams also had a nice game off the bench, amassing 11 points and 15 rebounds. Devin Booker scored 16 points to go along with five rebounds, while T.J. Warren accrued 14 points and seven rebounds. Phoenix will host the Washington Wizards for their next game on Tuesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Orlando Magic, 115-114, at Verizon Center on Sunday.

These two teams have now split their season series and there was very little to separate them in this game as well. Despite the Magic leading for over 44 minutes of this fixture, the Wizards took the most important lead at the buzzer. In fact, Washington's largest lead was just two points, as there were seven ties and seven lead changes in total. Washington ended up outscoring Orlando by 17 points in the second half to pull out the comeback win. Shooting was key for the Wizards, as they hit 54 percent of their three's and 92 percent of their free-throws. Orlando hit just 40 percent of their three-pointers and 63 percent of their free-throws. The Wizards also outasissted the Magic, 26-16. 

The Magic (23-40) have been in a rough stretch for seemingly months now and this tough loss only adds to those struggles. Terrence Ross led the way, as he tallied 20 points, four rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Aaron Gordon recorded a double-double, totaling 15 points, 11 rebounds and three assists. Bismack Biyombo got the start and contributed 14 points, and 15 rebounds. Evan Fournier finished second on the team with 18 points, while Elfrid Payton managed 15 points, five rebounds and three assists on 7-of-8 shooting. The Magic will host the New York Knicks on Monday for their next game. 

The Wizards (37-24) are one of the best home teams in the league and comeback wins like this show just why. Bradley Beal was the player of the game, as he accumulated 32 points, three rebounds, four assists and two steals. Bojan Bogdanovic came off the bench to provide 27 points, going 8-of-10 from three-point range. John Wall finished with 19 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. On deck for the Wizards is a road matchup against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Sacramento Kings in overtime, 110-109, at Golden One Center on Sunday. 

This was one of the closest games of the season, as it took a tip at the buzzer to decide a winner in overtime. The hero was Rudy Gobert, as he tipped in an air-ball at the buzzer to win the game by one. It took a monster comeback, as the Jazz had to outscore the Kings, 28-16 in the fourth quarter to send it to an extra session. Sacramento actually led for over 40 minutes of this game, as Utah's largest lead was only three points. The Jazz made their presence felt down low, as they won the rebounding differential, 46-37 and outscored them in the paint, 46-38. 

The Jazz (39-24) were able to escape with a win here, as this marked their fifth win in their last seven games. Gobert not only tipped in the game-winner, he finished the game with 16 points, 24 rebounds, three assists and three blocks. Rodney Hood led the team in scoring, as he dropped 28 points. Gordon Hayward contributed 23 points, five rebounds and five assists, while George Hill accrued 15 points, five rebounds and eight assists. On deck for Utah is a home matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday. 

The Kings (25-37) have now lost five of their last six games, but this was a great effort in a losing result. Ty Lawson led Sacramento with 19 points, four rebounds and five assists. Darren Collison finished second on the team with 18 points, three rebounds and five assists. Kosta Koufos totaled 12 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out in the fourth quarter, while Willie Cauley-Stein collected 15 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Sacramento will play the Denver Nuggets on Monday for their next game.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 104-89, at American Airlines Center on Sunday. 

The Mavericks (26-36) improved to 18-14 on their home court and are still on the outside looking in at the Western Conference playoffs, as they sit three games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eight-seed. The marquee moment of the game came on a Russell Westbrook flagrant 1 foul after he barreled over Harrison Barnes in the third quarter. Westbrook was trying to break away from a screen when he took one step too many, and took Barnes to the ground with him. 

Dallas led the Thunder (35-28) through each of the first three quarters, but a measly 18 points from Oklahoma City during the final period was far from enough to keep the game within striking distance. Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the win, while Seth Curry scored 22 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Nerlens Noel was effective in his 16 minutes off the bench, as the 76ers import pitched in 13 points and five rebounds on 6-of-7 shooting. 

Westbrook led the Thunder with 29 points, six rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block on 8-of-24 shooting. Enes Kanter led the Thunder bench with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Steven Adams added 19 points, five boards and one block. 

Both teams play on Tuesday, as the Thunder host the Portland Trail Blazers, while the Mavericks host the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 105-97, at Staples Center on Sunday. 

The Pelicans (25-38) came back in the second half after a rough second quarter where they got outscored 39-29 and the revival came on the back of the premier offensive talents in Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. The third quarter marked a better defensive impact, as the Pelicans held the Lakers (19-44) to just 14 points. With 1:44 left in the fourth quarter, Julius Randle tied the game up at 97 points apiece, but Davis and Jrue Holiday responded with scoring possessions to topple the Lakers at home. 

Cousins finished with 26 points, 15 rebounds and two assists across 31 minutes, while Davis posted 31 points on 10-of-22 shooting. Davis added nine rebounds and two assists and led all scorers in the contest. Holiday scored 20 points, to go with 12 assists and five boards. 

The Lakers shot the ball much more efficiently than the Pelicans, but the costly 25 turnovers to just 13 mishaps from the Pelicans is what ended up sinking their chances at their 20th win of the season. Brandon Ingram scored 16 points, alongside six rebounds and two assists, while Nick Young buried four three-pointers on his way to 19 points. 

Next up, the Pelicans play the second game of a back-to-back when they host the Utah Jazz on Monday, while the Lakers visit the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday.

												The Detroit Pistons dominated the host Philadelphia 76ers 136-106, at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday evening. 

The Pistons were hot right from the start, jumping out to a 33-25 lead after one quarter. They went on to win the remaining three quarters, continually building on their lead on their way to a season-high 136 points. This was a big win for Detroit, as it looks to hang on to the eighth spot in the East. 

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the high point man for the Pistons (30-32), with 26 points on hot 9-of-11 shooting from the field. Five other players scored in double digits for the Pistons, including Marcus Morris, who finished with 22 points, and Tobias Harris who chipped in 20, in 32 minutes off the bench. Ish Smith came up big with 13 assists and 11 points, in 23 minutes off the bench. The Pistons are now 4-2 in their last six games, and have improved to 11-20 on the road. They will head back home for their next contest though, as they play host to the Bulls on Monday. 

Meanwhile, this marks the fourth loss in the last five games for the Sixers (23-39). Nik Stauskas was the high-point man for Philly with 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting, while Dario Saric followed up with 19 points, a career-high eight assists, and six rebounds, in 29 minutes. T.J. McConnell chipped in 10 points to go along with eight assists, in 23 minutes. The 76ers are now 15-18 at home this season and will look to bounce back, as they play host to the Bucks on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the visiting Toronto Raptors 101-94, at BMO Harris Bradley Center, on Saturday evening. 

The Raptors held the Bucks to a season-low 12 first quarter points, but the Bucks retaliated with a 41-point second quarter, and took a 53-42 lead into halftime. Milwaukee went on to hold the lead, as the Raptors were not able to get anything going.

Khris Middleton led the way for the Bucks (28-33) with 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting, in 30 minutes, while Giannis Antetokounmpo followed up with 21 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. Spencer Hawes came up huge in 17 minutes off the bench, as he poured in 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting, to go along with eight rebounds. The only other player to score in double digits for Milwaukee was Malcolm Brogdon, who chipped in 17 points. The Bucks managed to come away with the win despite shooting 6-of-27 from long range and 43.7 percent from the field. They will look to build on this win as they go on to visit Philadelphia on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the Raptors (37-26) shot a bit better from the field but lost the battle on the glass, where they allowed Milwaukee nine offensive rebounds. DeMar DeRozan really struggled, shooting 5-of-13 from the field, as he looked burnt out, perhaps as a result of being overworked in the absence of Kyle Lowry. Serge Ibaka led the way for Toronto with 19 points and five rebounds, while Cory Joseph followed up with 14 points, eight assists and five rebounds.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 120-92, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday night.

After an exhausting 135-130 victory on Friday against the Hawks, Cleveland opted to rest LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, who'd combined for 81 points in the win. While that likely proved disappointing to the many in South Florida who showed up to see the dynamic duo in action, it was a prudent move for the top-seeded Cavaliers (42-19), who are looking to have their superstars as fresh as possible for the postseason run. An opportunistic Heat (29-34) team took advantage, pulling away with a 32-16 second quarter and never looking back. Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside led the way for Miami with a combined 43 points, and the Heat second unit totaled 53 points while getting extra run in the blowout win.

Channing Frye took the reins of the offense with the Big Three out of comission for Cleveland, posting a team-high 21 points, four rebounds, two steals and one block. Kyle Korver paced the starting five with 15 points, two assists and one rebound. Richard Jefferson provided 11 points as a reserve. Deron Williams, Tristan Thompson and Derrick Williams supplied a trio of 10-point efforts. Deron Williams added seven assists and five rebounds, Thompson registered six rebounds and three assists, and Derrick Williams hauled in six boards. 

Dragic led the Heat with 23 points, five assists and three rebounds. Whiteside tallied a 20-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included one block. Tyler Johnson was next with a bench-leading 17 points, which he supplemented six rebounds, two assists and two steals. Wayne Ellington chipped in 12 points, four boards and one steal. No other Miami player managed double digits in the scoring column, with Luke Babbitt (nine points, one assist, one steal) coming the closest.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Chicago Bulls, 101-91, at United Center on Saturday night.

The Clippers (37-25) had checked in to Saturday night uncharacteristically struggling, particularly on defense. They'd lost four of their five games coming out of the All-Star break and had surrendered over 120 points in three of those contests. However, they got back to fundamental Clippers basketball against the Bulls (31-31), limiting them to 42.2 percent shooting from the field and 35.3 percent from three-point range, while also eliciting 19 turnovers. Jamal Crawford stepped up off the bench by scoring a game-high 25 points and adding two rebounds, two assists and two steal, and four other players also hit double digits in the scoring column.

Chris Paul was next behind Crawford with 17 points, four assists, two rebounds, two steals and one block. Blake Griffin followed with 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds. J.J. Redick was effective in his usual complementary role, registering 13 points and one rebound. Luc Mbah a Moute had a rare offensive outburst by his standards, totaling 12 points and adding three rebounds, one assist and one steal. DeAndre Jordan generated a modest six points but did haul in 14 rebounds, dish out three assists and record a steal. 

The Bulls were led by Jimmy Butler, who tallied 16 points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals. Robin Lopez generated 12 points, six rebounds and two assists. Bobby Portis scored 11 points and brought down seven rebounds. Dwyane Wade totaled 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Paul Zipser paced the second unit with 10 points and two rebounds.

The Clippers head back home to face the Boston Celtics on Monday night, while the Bulls head to Detroit to take on the Pistons in a Monday evening showdown.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Denver Nuggets, 112-102, at Pepsi Center on Saturday evening. 

The Hornets (27-35) were in particular need of a win coming in to Saturday, as they'd dropped seven of their previous nine games. To make matters worse, Frank Kaminsky III, who'd done an outstanding job in Cody Zeller's stead while the latter had been out recently for an extended period with a quad injury, had succumbed to an AC joint sprain suffered in a 120-103 loss to the Suns on Thursday. However, Kemba Walker, who's carried the Charlotte offense many a time, and Nicolas Batum, who'd shot just 17.9 percent (5-for-28) over the prior two games, combined for 48 of Charlotte's 112 points on the night. They also managed a 9-for-15 tally from three-point range, leading to a superb 59.3 percent success rate from behind the arc for the Hornets overall. The Nuggets (28-34) had a much rougher go of it, shooting 45 percent from the field and 30 percent from long range.

Walker's 27 points led the Hornets, a total he supplemented with four rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block. Batum went for 21 points, dished out eight assists and posted two rebounds. Johnny O'Bryant III paced the bench with 15 points, six boards and one assist. Marvin Williams posted a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included three assists and two blocks. Cody Zeller produced a near double-double of 11 points, eight rebounds, two assists and one steal. Jeremy Lamb was productive in a reserve role as well with 12 points, four rebounds and one steal.

Nikola Jokic paced the Nuggets with 31 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and one steal. Danilo Gallinari tallied 22 points, five rebounds and one steal. Jamal Murray led the bench with 14 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. No other Denver player hit double digits in the scoring column, however, with Will Barton coming the closest with nine points, four rebounds, four assists and one block. Gary Harris notably went scoreless over 22 minutes, putting up just one shot attempt  and only adding one assist and one steal.

The Hornets head back home after their five-game Western Conference swing to tangle with the Indiana Pacers on Monday night, while the Nuggets remain home to take on the Sacramento Kings on Monday evening as well.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 123-108, at Toyota Center on Saturday.

In this potential playoff preview, the Rockets gave it to the Grizzlies in this blowout win. The third quarter is where Houston made their mark, as they outscored Memphis, 38-27, as the Grizzlies couldn't get within 12 from there. Three-point shooting was the difference in the game, with the Rockets going 18-of-42 from long distance, while the Grizzlies hit just 8-of-28. Fastbreak points was key as well, with Houston winning that differential, 17-4. 

The Grizzlies (36-27) have struggled on offense all season and they simply couldn't keep pace with the Rockets in this matchup. Mike Conley carried the load, as he tallied 23 points, six rebounds, seven assists and two steals. JaMychal Green totaled 20 points and 10 rebounds. Marc Gasol contributed 17 points, four rebounds, seven assists, two steals and four blocks. Toney Douglas came off the bench and scored 12 points to go along with five rebound and five assists. Memphis will have a much easier task on Monday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets for their next game.

The Rockets (44-19) have set fire to the league with their offense and abusing a Grizzlies defense like this shows just how dangerous they can be. James Harden continued his MVP form, collecting 33 points, seven rebounds, 11 assists and two steals. Clint Capela finished second on the team with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Eric Gordon was a huge spark off the bench, providing 18 points, two rebounds and two steals on 6-of-9 from three-point range. Patrick Beverley accumulated 12 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals. Houston will look to keep rolling on Monday in a road matchup against the San Antonio Spurs.

Despite Minnesota leading for the first 44 minutes, this ended up being an overtime thriller. San Antonio really turned it on in the second half, as they overcame a 12-point halftime deficit and held the T'Wolves to just 28 points in the second half. Defense was key all night, as Minnesota shot just 39 percent form the field and 25 percent from three-point range. San Antonio also combined for 18 blocks and steals, while the Timberwolves could only muster up nine of their own. The Spurs bench was huge as well, outscoring Minnesota's bench, 30-18.

The Timberwolves (25-37) had won three of four headed into this game, so an overtime loss against the Spurs is nothing to be ashamed of. Karl-Anthony Towns led the way for Minnesota, tallying 24 points and 14 rebounds. Ricky Rubio was their most valuable player, as he collected 11 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists en route to a triple-double. Andrew Wiggins finished second in scoring, totaling 17 points and four rebounds, despite going just 6-of-24 from the field. Gorgui Dieng recorded a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double. On deck for Minnesota is a home matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday. 

The Spurs (48-13) have now won seven-straight games, as this was their second-straight overtime victory. Kawhi Leonard once again carried the load, as he accumulated 34 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and six steals. LaMarcus Aldridge finished second on the team, totaling 18 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Pau Gasol was the only other Spur in double figures, providing 17 points, eight rebounds and three assists off the bench. San Antonio will look to keep rolling on Monday against the Houston Rockets.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 130-116, at Moda Center on Saturday.

Portland were expected to win this game easily and they left no doubt with this near wire-to-wire win. In fact, the Nets only lead came in the first two minutes, as the Blazers held the lead for the rest of the game. Portland's offense was unstoppable, as they hit 57 percent of their shots from the field and 64 percent from three-point range. Brooklyn weren't far behind, as they shot 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from long distance on their end. The Trail Blazers barely edged out many of the statistics, winning the shooting, rebounding, assisting, steals and turnover differentials. 

The Nets (10-51) have now lost 19 of their last 20 games, as they continue to slide down the standings. Brook Lopez led the way for Brooklyn, as he tallied 26 points, five rebounds and two blocks. Jeremy Lin finished second among starters, accruing 18 points, three rebounds and two assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was the only other starter in double figures, accumulating 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Sean Kilpatrick provided 20 points and five assists to lead the bench on 6-of-7 from three-point range. On deck for Brooklyn is a road matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday.

The Blazers (26-35) are battling for the eight-seed in the west and this win was much needed against some poor competition. C.J. McCollum led Portland with 31 points, five rebounds and five assists. Damian Lillard finished second among starters, collecting 19 points, five rebounds and 11 assists. Maurice Harkless amassed 18 points, three assists and three blocks. Jusuf Nurkic started at center and produced 17 points, six rebounds and five assists Al-Farouq Aminu led all bench players with 23 points and six rebounds. Portland's next game is crucial, as they play the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road Monday night.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the New York Knicks, 105-102, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday evening.

The two teams engaged in a rollercoaster affair, one that saw each of them dominate a quarter apiece and the Sixers make a modest comeback in the final minute to seal the win. The Sixers (23-38) decisively erased a 35-29 first-quarter deficit by exploding for 34 points of their own in the second period and limiting the Knicks (25-37) to 18 overall. New York turned the tables coming out of intermission, winning the third period by a 28-16 margin. That set up a nip-and-tuck fourth quarter that was decided in the final minute. The Knicks had a 102-100 lead at the one-minute mark after two Derrick Rose free throws but wouldn't score again, with Dario Saric sinking three of four free throws and Justin Anderson draining a six-foot jumper over the final 48 seconds to seal the win.

Lance Thomas led the way for New York with 21 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds and two steals. Rose was right behind him with 20 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis supplied matching 18-point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block, and the latter providing seven rebounds, one assist and one steal. Courtney Lee tallied 16 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals. 

Saric bounced back from a subpar effort against the Miami Heat on Wednesday to pace Philadelphia with a 21-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists. Anderson turned in his best game since joining the Sixers, leading the second unit with 19 points, five rebounds, two assists and one block. Robert Covington registered 16 points, four rebounds, three assists, five blocks and one steal. Jahlil Okafor compiled 12 points, eight boards, one assist and one block. T.J. McConnell submitted 11 points, four rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block. Richaun Holmes and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot were productive as reserves as well with matching 10-point tallies.

The Knicks head back home to tangle with the Golden State Warriors on Sunday afternoon, while the Sixers remain home to face the Detroit Pistons on Saturday evening.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Washington Wizards, 114-106, at Verizon Center on Friday evening. 

The Raptors (37-25) had come up short on Wednesday evening against this same Wizards (36-24) squad at home, as Washington had turned in a solid defensive effort by holding Toronto under 40 percent shooting. The Raptors had revenge on their mind Friday and successfully turned the tables, limiting their hosts to 37 percent shooting overall, including 33.3 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, they overcame their own struggles from the floor from two nights prior, tallying a 50.6 percent success rate overall that allowed them to overcome the 17 turnovers they were guilty of on the night.

DeMar DeRozan once again led the way for the Raptors with 32 points, which he supplemented with 13 rebounds and five assists. Norman Powell was next with a bench-leading 21 points, along with six rebounds, one assist and one steal. Cory Joseph provided 15 points, five rebounds and three assists. Serge Ibaka supplied 14 points, eight rebounds, one assist and two steals. 

John Wall paced the Wizards with 30 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, three blocks and one steal. Backcourt mate Bradley Beal followed closely behind with 27 points, which he complemented with seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. Otto Porter, Jr. bounced back from a scoreless outing over 19 minutes Wednesday to generate a full stat line of 18 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three steals and one block. Markieff Morris managed 11 points, eight boards, five assists, one steal and one block. Marcin Gortat had a rather atypical unproductive game with a modest six points, six rebounds and one assist.

The Raptors remain on the road and head to Milwaukee to face the Bucks on Saturday night, while the Wizards remain home to tangle with the Orlando Magic on Sunday afternoon.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the visiting Miami Heat 110-99, at Amway Center on Friday evening. 

The Magic got out to a great start, with a 33-25 first quarter, and managed to hold the lead going into half time. They then out-scored the Heat by five in the third quarter, behind 12 points in the quarter from Nikola Vucevic, and were able to hang on to close it out at home. With this win the Magic take the season series 3-1.  

The Magic (23-39) are now 2-2 in their four games since trading Serge Ibaka and running with Terrence Ross as their starting small forward. Ross finished with 10 points on 5-of-9 shooting in the contest, while Nikola Vuvecic led the way with 25 points on 11-of-18 shooting. Orlando's three other starters also scored in double digits, including Aaron Gordon with 21 points and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes, while Jeff Green chipped in 11 points off the bench. The Magic will go on to visit Washington on Sunday, as they look for a second straight win. 

Meanwhile, the Heat (28-34) trailed by as many as 19 in the second half and were never able to fully recover. James Johnson led the way for Miami, with 19 points, six assists, four rebounds, two assists and two steals, in 34 minutes off the bench. Hassan Whiteside hauled in a monstrous 18 rebounds to go along with 15 points, while Goran Dragic also chipped in 15 points. This marks the second loss in the three games for the Heat, as they teeter on the edge of the top eight in the East.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Atlanta Hawks 135-130, at Philips Arena on Friday evening. 

The Cavs knocked down an NBA record 25 three-pointers on their way to victory, but came very close to letting it slip away, as the Hawks battled back from a 25 -point deficit, to bring it to a one-point game with 1:31 left. The Cavs were able to hang on largely thanks to a clutch three from none other than Kyle Korver, who made his first return to Atlanta since being traded. 

The Cavs (42-18) shot a blistering 54.3 percent from deep, as they hit 25-of-46 of their three-point attempts. Kyrie Irving and LeBron James both came up with stellar performances, combining for 81 points. Irving finished with a game-high 43 points, while James filled the stat sheet with 38 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. Channing Frye and Richard Jefferson were the only other players to score in double digits for Cleveland, finishing with 11 points each. The Cavs will look to build on the momentum from this win as they visit Miami on Saturday to face the second night of a back-to-back. 

Meanwhile, the Hawks (34-27) mounted an amazing rally to trim a 25-point deficit with seven minutes left in the third quarter, to a one-point margin with 1:31 left in the game. Paul Millsap hit a couple clutch shots late in the fourth to bring the Hawks as close as they would come, and finished the game with 27 points and nine rebounds, in 37 minutes. Tim Hardaway Jr. was the high-point man for Atlanta, finishing with 36 points in 35 minutes off the bench. The Hawks remain fifth in the East but will need to get back to their winning ways, as they are only 4-6 in their last 10. They go on to play host to the Pacers on Sunday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 112-101, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening.

The Clippers (36-25) have a well-earned reputation for playing solid defense and taking good care of the ball, but both of those trends failed to materialize Friday. The Bucks (27-33) saw Giannis Antetokounmpo break out of a recent slump, as he tallied 24 points, eight assists, five rebounds, two steals and two blocks. After shooting 9-for-26 over the previous two contests, the Greek Freak drained 10 of 13 shots from the field and Milwaukee shot 55 percent from the field overall. Meanwhile, the Clippers turned the ball over a whopping 23 times, with Blake Griffin and Jamal Crawford having the dubious distinction of leading the way with five apiece.

Griffin did co-lead Los Angeles in scoring with 21 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds and eight assists. Chris Paul matched Griffin's scoring total and added five assists, three rebounds and one steal. DeAndre Jordan posted a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one block. J.J. Redick contributed 10 points, four rebounds and four assists. Crawford paced the second unit with nine points and one rebound.

Greg Monroe matched Antetokounmpo's scoring total and added five rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block. Khris Middleton started and produced 19 points, nine assists, four rebounds and four steals. Matthew Delladedova was productive in a reserve role, supplying 15 points, eight assists and one rebound. Malcolm Brogdon totaled 12 points and three rebounds. 

The Clippers are on their way to the Windy City for a Saturday night showdown with the Chicago Bulls while the Bucks remain home to tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Saturday evening as well.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 104-100, at American Airlines Center on Friday evening. 

The Grizzlies led 22-20 after a tight first quarter, but the Mavs pushed back in the middle two quarters, where they out-scored Memphis 59-50. The Mavs led 90-78 with 7:43 left in the fourth but then went cold, scoring only four points over the next seven minutes, allowing the Grizzlies to bring the deficit down to four points with 46 seconds left. The Mavs were then able to seal the deal with clutch free throw shooting down the stretch, including a freebee thanks to a technical foul called on Memphis' coach, David Fizdale.

The Mavericks (25-36) shot 47.6 percent from the field, but struggled from long range, where they hit only 18.5 percent. All five starters scored in double digits for Dallas, while Seth Curry led the way with 24 points on 8-of-15 shooting, in 37 minutes. Harrison Barnes followed up with 18 points, while Nerlens Noel chipped in 15 points and a career-high-tying 17 rebounds, in his first start as a member of the Mavericks. The Mavs are now three games behind the eighth-place Nuggets, and will look to inch closer by going for another upset win, as they play host to the Thunder on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, the Grizzlies (36-26) nearly completed the comeback but fell just short, ending a two-game winning streak. Mike Conley was the high-point man for Memphis, with 30 points, to go along with four assists and two rebounds, in 36 minutes. Three other players scored in double digits for the Grizz, including Zach Randolph, who added 24 points and 10 rebounds, in 29 minutes off the bench. Chandler Parsons failed to make an impact against his former team, as he finished with only seven points on 3-of-11 shooting, in 24 minutes. The Grizzlies will look to shake this one off, as they are right back in action on Saturday for the second night of a back-to-back, when they visit Houston to take on the Rockets.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-97, at Vivnt Smart Home Arena on Friday.

Utah was expected to win this game easily and a wire-to-wire victory shows just how much they took care of business. In fact, Utah led by double-digits for the final 20 minutes. The Jazz were efficient on offense, recording 25 assists on 38 made shots, while hitting over 51 percent of their attempts. Three-point shooting was also decisive, as Brooklyn went just 7-of-29 from long distance, while Utah went 12-of-26. 

The Nets (10-50) ended their 16-game losing streak in their most recent game, but this was a tough task against a feisty Utah bunch. Quincy Acy led the way for the Nets, as he dropped 18 points on 5-of-7 shooting off the bench. Brook Lopez was the only starter in double figures, as he totaled 17 points, five rebounds and two blocks. Trevor Booker came off the bench to provide eight points and 11 rebounds. On deck for Brooklyn is a road matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday.

The Jazz (38-24) came into this fixture in the midst of a two-game losing streak, so a matchup against the Nets is just what the doctor ordered. George Hill was the player of the game, as he amassed 34 points and seven assists on 10-of-12 shooting. Derrick Favors finished second on the team with 19 points and 12 rebounds on 8-of-9 shooting. Rudy Gobert went a perfect 4-of-4 from the field to collect 11 points, seven rebounds and two blocks. Gordon Hayward contributed 12 points, three rebounds, six assists and two steals. The Jazz' next game is on Sunday against the Sacramento Kings.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 118-111, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Friday.

These are two teams going in opposite directions, but Phoenix put that to the side by upsetting Oklahoma City in this big win. After trailing for the entirety of the first quarter, Phoenix responded by leading for the final 30-pus minutes. The assist-to-turnover ratio was key, as the Suns doubled up the Thunder, 28-14 in assists, while committing two less turnovers. Oklahoma City couldn't crack 42 percent shooting, while Phoenix shot nearly 50 percent from the field. The Suns bench was huge too, outscoring the Thunder's bench, 55-22.

The Thunder (35-27) had to play this game in the second half of a back-to back set and it was clear they didn't have the legs against this weak Suns team. Russell Westbrook had legs though, tallying 48 points, 17 rebounds, nine assists and three steals. Alex Abrines finished second on the team with 13 points. Steven Adams fell just shy of a double-double, totaling nine points and 10 rebounds. Enes Kanter led the bench with 11 points and five rebounds. 

The Suns (20-42) came into this game tied for the worst record in the west, so this win is a mixed result. Eric Bledsoe led Phoenix with 18 points, three rebounds, five assists and four steals. Devin Booker finished second on the team, accumulating 17 points, seven rebounds and three assists. The bench was huge, as Alan Williams, Tyler Ulis and Leandro Barbosa each scored 14 points a piece. Williams also added 13 rebounds and three blocks, while Ulis provided four rebounds, seven assists and three steals. T.J Warren also collected 15 points and seven rebounds.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 101-98, at Smoothie King Center on Friday. 

This was one of the tightest games of the season, as there were 11 ties and 11 lead changes in this overtime thriller. In addition, neither team led by more than eight points, as it was full of swings. Defense was key for the Spurs, as they held the Pelicans to under 39 percent shooting, while forcing them to commit 16 turnovers. In addition, San Antonio shot 42 percent, while committing just 11 turnovers. Bench production was a huge factor too, with San Antonio winning that battle, 35-16.

The Spurs (47-12) have now won six-straight games, as they continue to vie for the top-seed in the west. Kawhi Leonard once again carried the load, as he tallied 31 points, seven rebounds, six assists and three steals. LaMarcus Aldridge was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 21 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks. Patty Mills led the bench with 15 points, two rebounds, two assists and two steals, while Pau Gasol contributed 12 points, eight rebounds and two assists off the pine as well. The Spurs will host the Minnesota Timberwolves for their next game on Saturday.

The Pelicans (24-38) have yet to find their rhythm with DeMarcus Cousins, as this marks their fourth-straight loss with him in the lineup. Anthony Davis led New Orleans with 29 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Jrue Holiday finished second on the team with 26 points, seven rebounds and five assists. DeMarcus Cousins was the only other Pelican in double figures, collecting 19 points, 23 rebounds and four assists. New Orleans will return to action on Saturday in a road matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 115-95, at Staples Center on Friday.

This was a lopsided matchup on paper headed in and the Celtics left no doubt with this 20-point win. It was over early, as Boston took a 23-point lead into the half and led by 31 at times in the third quarter. Rebounding was a huge difference, as the Celtics won that differential, 46-34. Boston ended up shooting 51 percent from the field, whole holding Los Angeles to under 43 percent shooting. 

The Celtics (40-22) have now won three of four, as they continue to battle Cleveland for the top-spot in the east. Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston, as he tallied 18 points and eight assists. Al Horford finished second on the team with 17 points, four rebounds and three assists. Jaylen Brown led the bench with 16 points and eight rebounds. Amir Johnson provided 13 points, six rebounds and four assists, while Avery Bradley totaled 15 points, four rebounds and four assists. Boston's next game will be on Sunday against the Phoenix Suns. 

The Lakers (19-43) now find themselves last in the west with this ugly blowout loss. Jordan Clarkson led the way for Los Angeles, as he contributed 20 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals off the bench. D'Angelo Russell led the starters with 17 points, three rebounds and four assists. Julius Randle was the only other Laker in double figures, collecting 13 points, seven rebounds and three assists.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Golden State Warriors, 94-87, at United Center on Thursday evening.

The Warriors (50-11) knew that they'd have a massive challenge on their hands in trying to make up for the extended absence of Kevin Durant (knee), but also had to have a certain measure of confidence knowing that the Splash Bros. tandem that had been vastly successful before Durant's arrival were ready to chuck away. That strategy fell woefully short Thursday, not necessarily in the margin of defeat, but rather, in overall offensive efficiency. Golden State shot an atypical 38.6 percent from the floor, including an unsightly 20 percent (6-for-30) from behind the arc.  Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson were particularly aggressive as expected, yet managed to drain only 15 of their combined 49 shot attempts. The Bulls (31-30) also won the battle down low, outrebounding the visitors by a 49-41 margin. 

Curry did lead the Warriors with 23 points, six rebounds, five assists and five steals. Thompson was a distant second, netting only 13 points (5-22 FG, 1-11 3Pt) along with one rebound and one assist. Draymond Green, another player expected to help pick up the slack in Durant's stead, posted 12 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, two blocks and one steal. Rookie Patrick McCaw, starting at small forward, tallied 11 points, four boards, two assists, two steals and one block. Andre Iguodala led the second unit with 10 points, seven rebounds and two assists.

Jimmy Butler paced the Bulls with 22 points, six assists, five rebounds, four steals and one block. Bobby Portis managed a 17-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included one block. Dwyane Wade supplied 12 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals. Robin Lopez registered 10 points, three rebounds and one block. The returning Paul Zipser led the bench with nine points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal.

The Warriors head to the Big Apple to take on the New York Knicks on Sunday afternoon, while the Bulls remain home for a Saturday night showdown with the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Charlotte Hornets 120-103 Thursday at Talking Stick Resort Arena. 

The win for the Suns (19-42) ended a three-game losing streak and elevated them into a tie for the worst record in the Western Conference with the Lakers. The game managed to stay rather close through the first 36 minutes, but then the home team turned it on in the final period and outscored Charlotte by 14 points. It was a complete team effort from Phoenix, as six different players managed to score in double figures. Rookie Marquese Chriss led the way with an efficient 17 points in just 22 minutes, while T.J. Warren, Alan Williams and Leandro Barbosa each added 16 points. Devin Booker had a solid all-around game, posting 15 points, nine assists and six rebounds, while Eric Bledsoe wasn't too far behind with 14 points and seven assists. Overall, it was a great shooting performance from the Suns, as they managed to hit a scorching 59.7 percent from the field. 

As for the Hornets (26-35), Thursday's defeat marked their worst loss since early February against the Rockets, and they now sit three games behind the Pistons for the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference. To make matters worse for Charlotte, Frank Kaminksy left the game in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury and did not return after scoring 16 points in 32 minutes. Kemba Walker led the way scoring for the Hornets with 26 points, eight assists and four rebounds in 32 minutes, while Marvin Williams added 19 points of his own. The problem for Charlotte lied in their bench, as the eight reserves who saw the floor Thursday managed to score just 23 of the team's 103 points. 

Up next, the Suns will remain home Friday to take on the Thunder, while the Hornets will head to Denver on Saturday to take on the Nuggets.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers took down the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, 114-109. 

Portland (25-35) has had a disappointing season but made up some ground in the Western Conference playoff race with a big win over OKC.  The Blazers were carried to victory by strong play from their tandem of backcourt stars.  Damian Lillard led the team with 33 points on 11-of-23 shooting, while C.J. McCollum added another 18 points.  On top of that, it was perhaps the best game of new Blazer Jusuf Nurkic's young career.  Nurkic scored 18 points and dished out six assists while blocking five shots.  Nurkic also led the team with 12 rebounds, including two clutch offensive boards near the end of the game.  Despite tough opposition from Thunder superstar Russell Westbrook, Portland was able to fight for the narrow victory at the end of the game.   

Oklahoma City (35-26) saw superstar Russell Westbrook put the weight of the team on his shoulders throughout the game.  Westbrook took a whopping 36 shots on the night, making only 12.  However, he went a perfect 15-of-15 at the free-throw line and had six three-pointers, finishing the night with a massive 45 points.  As a team, it was not the Thunder's strongest showing, as they shot under 40 percent and had just 11 assists on the night.  Despite the Blazers generally being a weaker team on the glass, the Thunder were also out-rebounded 44-40.  This was despite the efforts of bench big man Enes Kanter, who had an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double.

Portland will host the Nets on Saturday, while the Thunder will visit Phoenix on Friday.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Orlando Magic, 101-90, at Amway Center on Wednesday evening.

Kristaps Porzingis made a somewhat surprising return to the starting lineup after missing the previous two games with an ankle injury, and did so at center, where Joakim Noah remains out following a procedure to clear out loose bodies in his left knee. The move paid dividends, as the seven-footer scored a team-high 20 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists and one steal. The Knicks (25-36) were solid on the defensive side of the ball as well, limiting the Magic (22-39) to 41 percent shooting overall and 20 percent (5-for-25) from behind the arc. They were particularly stingy coming out of halftime, as they stymied their hosts to the tune of only 16 points in the third period. 

Derrick Rose was right behind Porzingis with 19 points, seven boards, four assists and one steal. Carmelo Anthony tallied a near double-double with 17 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two steals. Lance Thomas remained in the starting five at power forward despite Porzingis' return and produced 11 points, five rebounds, one assist and two steals. Justin Holiday led the second unit with 14 points, one rebound, one steal and one block.

Evan Fournier paced Orlando with 22 points, which he supplemented with two boards and two assists. D.J. Augustin followed with a bench-leading 15 points, along with four rebounds and one assist. Nikola Vucevic supplied a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included one steal. Aaron Gordon shook off a quad contusion to register 10 points and five boards. Jeff Green was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, two rebounds, two blocks and one steal. 

The Knicks travel back north for a Friday night showdown with the Philadelphia 76ers, while the Magic remain home to tangle with the Miami Heat on Friday evening as well.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Toronto Raptors, 105-96, at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday evening.

The Raptors (36-25) have put up valiant efforts thus far in the absence of All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry, with DeMar DeRozan particularly taking on an elevated role. However, when quality opponents come calling, the void felt by the absence of a player of Lowry's caliber eventually rears its ugly head. Such was the case Wednesday, as the Wizards (36-23) leveraged superb efforts from trade-deadline acquisition Bojan Bogdanovic and trusted shooting guard Bradley Beal to pull out the tough road win. The pair combined for nearly half of Washington's point total, and the visitors made a game-changing statement in the second quarter by outscoring their hosts by a whopping 26-1 in the first 5:54 of the period. On the defensive end, the Wizards stymied Toronto to the tune of sub-40 percent success rates from both the field and three-point range overall.

Bogdanovic paced the Wizards overall with 27 points, his best scoring haul since donning his new team's uniform. His effort included a sensational 6-for-7 tally from behind the arc. Beal followed with 23 points, three assists, one rebound, two steals and one block. Markieff Morris was next with a productive stat line of 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists. John Wall generated a 12-point, 13-assist double-double that also included four rebounds and one block. Marcin Gortat matched Wall's scoring total and added eight boards and one assist. Otto Porter, Jr. surprisingly went scoreless over 19 minutes, contributing only three rebounds and one steal. Bogdanovic's aforementioned hot hand combined with Porter's struggles allowed the former ample playing time.

As customary, DeMar DeRozan led Toronto, totaling 24 points, four rebounds and two assists. Serge Ibaka, whose offensive presence has been especially valued in the wake of Lowry's injury, provided 22 points, 12 rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Norman Powell was next with a bench-leading 17 points, which he supplemented two boards and two assists. Cory Joseph provided 11 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal. Jonas Valanciunas mustered a modest seven points but did haul in 11 boards and dish out one assist.

The two teams now head back to the Nation's Capital for the second game of the home-and-home series, which unfolds on Friday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 100-95, at Phillips Arena on Wednesday evening. 

The two teams came in to Wednesday's contest with well-earned reputations as solid defensive squads, and the Mavericks (24-36) particularly had built an impressive track record of taking care of the basketball this season. While scoring was relatively hard to come by, neither unit seemed to be able to stop handing the ball to the other, with the end result being a combined 42 turnovers. The Hawks (34-26) were guilty of 22 of those, but overcame their mistakes with 56.3 percent shooting overall, including 47.6 percent from three-point range. All five members of Atlanta's first unit shot 50 percent or better, and four of them posted double digits in the scoring column. The Hawks built up a solid 63-52 halftime lead and were able to hang on despite being outscored 43-37 in the second half.

Harrison Barnes continued to serve as the offensive linchpin for the Mavericks, posting a team-high 25 points that he supplemented with four rebounds, four assists and two steals. Seth Curry was once again his trusty wingman, providing 21 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. Dirk Nowitzki and Yogi Ferrell followed with matching 11-point efforts, with the former also supplying 10 rebounds and one assist and the latter registering nine dimes and a pair of boards. Dorian Finney-Smith, who drew the start for Wesley Matthews (hip), could only muster a modest five points, two rebounds, two steals and one block. 

Paul Millsap led the way for the Hawks with a near triple-double of 18 points, 10 assists, eight rebounds and one block. Dennis Schroder was next with 17 points, six assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Kent Bazemore tallied 15 points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. Dwight Howard chipped in with a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included four assists, three steals and two blocks. Ersan Ilyasova led the bench with 18 points, one rebound and a trio of steals. 

The Mavericks head back home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night, while the Hawks remain home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday evening as well.

It was a wire-to-wire win for the Heat, as they led by 10 after the first quarter and by 20 headed into halftime. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive, as Miami recorded eight more assists than Philly, while committing six less turnovers. The Heat also dominated the shooting, hitting 54 percent of their shots to the Sixers 44 percent. 

The Sixers (22-38) just learned that they lost Joel Embiid (knee) for the season and games like this could be a sign of things to come. Robert Covington led Philly in scoring, as he tallied 19 points and five rebounds. T.J. McConnell finished second among starters with 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. Richaun Holmes came off the bench to provide 15 points and six rebounds. The Sixers will host the New York Knicks on Friday for their next game. 

The Heat (28-33) have been one of the best teams in the league across the last two months, as this win marks their 10th home win in 11 tries. Tyler Johnson led Miami in scoring, as he collected 24 points, two rebounds, four assists and two steals off the bench. Wayne Ellington was second on the team, dropping 18 points of his own off the pine. Hassan Whiteside totaled 15 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and four blocks. Dion Waiters and Goran Dragic also scored 15 points a piece. Miami will play the Orlando Magic on the road for their next game on Friday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 110-98, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Wednesday.

Double-digit road wins in the NBA are rare, but wire-to-wire ones are even more impressive. That's just what the Nuggets did here, as they led by 17 at the end of the first quarter and carried a 26-point lead into halftime. Rebounding was the difference in the game, with Denver winning that battle, 45-34. The Nuggets also won the shooting differential, hitting 49 percent of their shots to the Bucks 46 percent. 

The Nuggets (28-33) now find themselves up 2.5 games in the eight-seed in the west and road wins like this only add to their resume'. Nikola Jokic recorded his second-straight triple-double, as he accumulated 13 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. Danilo Gallinari led Denver in scoring, collecting 22 points and five rebounds. Jamal Murray got the start for Jameer Nelson and contributed 10 points, five assists and two steals. Gary Harris totaled 14 points, three rebounds and two assists. Denver will host the Charlotte Hornets for their next game on Saturday.

The Bucks (26-33) have been one of the worst teams in the league across their last 20 games and home blowouts like this are simply embarrassing. Khris Middleton led the way for Milwaukee, as he provided 21 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals off the bench. Greg Monroe also played well off the bench, contributing 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the best starter, tallying 15 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Malcolm Brogdon led the starters with 17 points, two rebounds, three assists and three steals. Milwaukee will host the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday for their next fixture.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Detroit Pistons, 109-86, at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday.

New Orleans was desperate for a win and this dominating victory inches them a little closer to the eight-seed in the west. They did all their damage in the first and fourth quarter, as they outscored Detroit, 62-34. The Pistons had one of the worst shooting games of the season, as they went 40-of-103 from the field, 3-of-17 from the free-throw line and 3-of-23 from three-point range. The Pelicans shot well on their end, hitting 50 percent of their shots, while going 22-of-23 from the free-throw line. Defensive rebounding was decisive as well, with New Orleans winning that battle, 45-27.

The Pistons (29-32) had won three of four headed into this matchup, so this 23-point loss is obviously disappointing. Jon Leuer led Detroit, as he collected 22 points, seven rebounds and three steals. Andre Drummond did get ejected, but still totaled 13 points and 17 rebounds, despite going 1-of-10 from the free-throw line. Tobias Harris led the bench with 15 points and six rebounds. 

The Pelicans (24-37) were 0-3 with DeMarcus Cousins and this marks their first win since the trade, despite the fact that Cousins was suspended for this matchup (technicals). Anthony Davis carried the load, as he tallied 33 points, 14 rebounds and three assists on 11-of-17 shooting. Jrue Holiday finished second on the team with 22 points, four rebounds and five assists. Dante Cunningham was a surprise, providing 16 points and five rebounds.

												The host Boston Celtics beat the reigning champion Cleveland Cavaliers, 103-99, in a dramatic Wednesday-night thriller.  

Boston (39-22) moved to just three games back from the first seed with the win.  It was a much-needed boost for the Celtics, as the team was coming off a blowout loss to the Atlanta Hawks and had been just 1-2 coming out of the All-Star Break.  Boston looked like it was back in the swing of things on Wednesday, however, as the team earned a hard-fought win over the Eastern Conference's top team.  All-Star Isaiah Thomas bounced back from his worst outing of the season against Atlanta to score 31 points over Cleveland, including a three-pointer to put the Celtics ahead with 45 seconds remaining.  In his third game back from injury, guard Avery Bradley looked brilliant, scoring 11 points and locking down Cleveland's Kyrie Irving on the game's final possession.  Big man Al Horford, meanwhile, broke out of a bit of a slump with a near triple-double, recording nine points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.  Overall, it was a much-needed and energizing win for the Celtics as they look to fight for the top spot in the East going down the stretch.  

Cleveland (41-18) saw new addition Deron Williams debut in Wednesday's game.  The veteran made an immediate impact, playing 31 minutes and scoring 13 on 5-of-10 shooting.  Superstar LeBron James, meanwhile, led the team with his seventh triple-double of the season.  James had 28 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists on the night.  All-Star Kyrie Irving also scored 28, but failed to convert when given the opportunity to take the team's last shot after being smothered by tight defense from Avery Bradley.  One issue for Cleveland was rebounding, where the Celtics held a 47-40 edge despite struggles for most of the season.  

The Celtics will visit the Lakers on Friday, while Cleveland will see Atlanta.

												The host San Antonio Spurs took down the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, 100-99.

The Spurs (46-13) have won five straight and look poised to make a push for the first seed in the Western Conference after an injury to Golden State's Kevin Durant.  On Wednesday, San Antonio saw stellar play from superstar forward Kawhi Leonard.  Leonard had a double-double thanks to a team-leading 31 points and 10 rebounds.  More importantly, though, Leonard sank the game-winning jumper with 2.4 seconds remaining in the game to earn the win for his team.  He truly put the team on his back, as he was the only Spur to attempt more than nine field goals on the night.  He led the team in not only points and rebounds, but steals as well, as he recorded three takeaways on the defensive end.  It was a night to remember for the MVP contender and reigning two-time Defensive Player of the Year.  

Indiana (31-30) kept it impressively close with the powerhouse Spurs.  Star forward Paul George led the team on offense despite shooting just 5-of-18.  George had 22 points and went a perfect 10-of-10 at the free-throw line.  One area that sank the Pacers was three-point shooting, as the team hit only 29 percent of its shots from beyond the arc.  It was tough to find an offensive rhythm despite shooting 45 percent overall, as the team hit only 72 percent of its free-throws and struggled from deep.

												The visiting Minnesota Timberwolves demolished the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, 107-80.

Minnesota (25-36) saw one of its most convincing wins of the season, as sophomore phenom Karl-Anthony Towns continued his stretch of dominance.  Towns took his game to another level in February, averaging over 28 points and 13 rebounds per game while shooting over 60 percent.  On Wednesday, he looked as solid as ever, scoring 21 points on 9-of-16 shooting to go along with 15 rebounds.  Five Timberwolves finished with at least 11 points in what was a well-rounded team effort on offense.  Third-year wing Andrew Wiggins scored 20 points for the 18th straight game, while Shabazz Muhammad had 18 in just 23 minutes of play.  The Wolves hit 50 percent of their shots from the field, 50 percent from beyond the arc, and over 80 percent from the free-throw line.  

Utah (37-24) has now dropped two straight games in what has been a minor slide in an otherwise great season.  Wednesday's game certainly marked a low-point for the Jazz, who shot under 39 percent and made only four three-pointers en route to only 80 points on the night.  The team's high scorer was third-year Australian point guard Dante Exum, who had 15 points in 28 minutes off the bench.  The game quickly got out of hand for Utah, leading no member of the starting five to play more than 26 minutes on the night.  It will likely be a performance the Jazz hope to forget.  

The Wolves will visit San Antonio on Saturday, while Utah will host the Nets on Friday.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 122-103 Wednesday at Staples Center. 

After a high-scoring, competitive first quarter, the Rockets (43-19) wasted no time opening up the game in the second period and building their lead up to 12 points before entering the locker room. From there, Houston continued to pour it on from there and reached a lead as large as 30 points as the two teams entered the fourth quarter. James Harden led the way scoring four the Rockets with a game-high 26 points to go along with nine assists in 36 minutes, while Ryan Andersen was hitting on all cylinders Wednesday night, hitting 6-of-11 shots from behind the arc en route to scoring 23 points in 30 minutes. His shooting was contagious, as the entire Houston team hit 20 threes, proving to have too much firepower for their opponent. 

Their opponent, the Clippers (36-24), proved to be overmatched once again by a Western Conference foe and have now lost three of their last four games after entering the All-Star break on a four-game winning streak. As a result of the loss, the Clippers are now just a half-game ahead of the sixth-place Grizzlies and one game ahead of the Thunder at the No. 7 spot. Blake Griffin led the way scoring for Los Angeles, but had just 17 points, four rebounds and five assists in 35 minutes. Chris Paul had a double-double of 16 points and 11 assists, but he shot a disappointing 5-of-13 from the field. As a team, the Clippers managed to shoot just 44.2 percent from the field in the embarrassing defeat. 

Up next, the Rockets will head home Saturday to take on the Grizzlies, while the Clippers will look to get back on the right track in Milwaukee on Friday.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Sacramento Kings 109-100 Wednesday at Golden 1 Center.

After 16 straight losses and losing 27 of their last 28 games, the Nets (10-49) finally were on the winning side Wednesday night, and they did so in fairly convincing fashion. Brooklyn opened up the game with a 14-4 lead and never looked back, as they managed to hold onto the lead for all 48 minutes against Sacramento. Brook Lopez led the way offensively for the Nets, scoring a game-high 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting from the field and grabbing eight rebounds in 30 minutes. Jeremy Lin added an efficient 17 points in 20 minutes, while his backup, Isaiah Whitehead, came off the bench to shoot 7-of-7 shooting from the free throw line en route to scoring 14 points in just 18 minutes. As a team, Brooklyn managed to get to the line at their own will and convert, hitting 30-of-36 foul shots Wednesday.

As for the Kings (25-35), Wednesday's loss marked their third straight and brought their record to 1-3 in the post-DeMarcus Cousins era of the franchise. It was the performance from their bench players that kept Sacramento in the game, with the team's three top scorers all being reserves. The newest King, Buddy Hield, scored a game-high 16 points on 6-of-11 shooting from the field and 4-of-6 shoot from behind the arc, while Ty Lawson and Tyreke Evans each scored 15 points, with Lawson adding a game-high nine assists. Sacramento as a team overall was actually had a solid shooting performance from the outside, hitting 11 of their 22 three-pointers, but in the end, it wasn't enough.

Up next, the Nets will head to Utah on Friday to take on the Jazz, while the Kings will be waiting at home Sunday to take on the same opponent.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Golden State Warriors, 112-108, at Verizon Center on Tuesday evening. 

The Warriors (50-10) were already facing a tough challenge coming in to Tuesday, as they were up against a quality opponent on the road and playing in their third game in four nights. However, matters got exponentially worse for them early in the first quarter, when Kevin Durant was forced from the contest with a hyperextended left knee. A frazzled Golden State squad fell behind 40-26 by the end of the period, before regrouping and outscoring the Wizards (35-23) by a 59-45 margin over the second and third quarters. The Warriors' resurgence led to an 85-85 stalemate entering the final 12 minutes, and with 17 seconds remaining, the game was once again tied at 108. Washington then saw Otto Porter, Jr. and Markieff Morris drain two free throws apiece, and Klay Thompson miss a 26-foot three-point jumper as time expired to seal the win.

Stephen Curry stepped up in Durant's absence to tally a team-high 25 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, four assists and three steals. Thompson was next with 16 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Draymond Green posted a 14-point, 14-assist double-double that also included eight boards, two steals and one block. Shaun Livingston matched Green's scoring total while leading the bench, adding three rebounds, two assists, two blocks and one steal. Zaza Pachulia managed 12 points and eight rebounds. 

Bradley Beal paced the Wizards with 25 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals. Morris was close behind with 22 points, six rebounds, one assist, four blocks and two steals. Bojan Bogdanovic led the second unit with 16 points, his highest scoring total since joining the Wizards. Porter filled out the stat sheet with 14 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two steals. Marcin Gortat and John Wall turned in matching 12-point efforts, with the former adding 12 boards, one assist and one block, and the latter dishing out a game-high 19 assists while also bringing down six rebounds and recording a pair of steals. 

The Warriors now head to the Windy City to tangle with the Bulls on Thursday evening, while the Wizards head north of the border for a showdown with the conference rival Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in overtime, 120-113, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday.

There wasn't a whole lot to separate these two in this matchup, as it took free basketball to decide a winner. Portland actually led for the majority of the game, as Detroit outscored them by 11 in the fourth quarter and overtime. Turnovers were the glaring difference in the game, as the Pistons committed just seven turnovers, while forcing 24 from the Trail Blazers. Portland dominated the shooting strangely enough, as they shot 52 percent to Detroit's 43 percent. 

The Blazers (23-35) are battling for the eight-seed in the west and overtime losses like this are devastating for that pursuit. Damian Lillard did all he could for Portland, as he led the team with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. C.J. McCollum tallied 25 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jusuf Nurkic continued his good form with Portland, as he accrued 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Those three did combine for 14 turnovers though, which was double the total of the Pistons. Portland will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday for their next game. 

The Pistons (29-31) are slowly climbing back to .500, as they've now won three of their last four games. Marcus Morris was the player of the game, as he accumulated 37 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Andre Drummond finished second on the team, totaling 19 points and 15 rebounds. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope collected 16 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Ish Smith was a huge spark off the bench, providing 12 points, seven assists and seven steals. Detroit's in action again on Wednesday in a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Chicago Bulls, 125-107, at United Center on Tuesday evening.

The surprising victory may have well have been one of the best road victories for the Nuggets (27-33) this season, considering the environment and quality of opponent. Denver accomplished the rather improbable feat with a stellar offensive effort that saw seven players post double-digit scoring and the team collectively shoot an outstanding 56.3 percent from the floor and 43.3 percent from three-point range. Chicago's cause was significantly undermined by an atypically poor shooting night from Jimmy Butler, who posted only eight points on a 3-of-13 tally from the floor. 

Danilo Gallinari led the Nuggets with 22 points, three rebounds and one steal. Wilson Chandler followed with 20 points, three rebounds, one assist and one block. Nikola Jokic bounced back after some recent modest games by his lofty standards, exploding for a 19-point, 16-rebound, 10-assist triple-double that also included one block. Gary Harris went for 15 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. Will Barton matched Harris' point total while leading the second unit and added eight boards, three assists, two steals and one block. Jameer Nelson managed 12 points, two rebounds and one assist. Jamal Murray tallied 14 points, three assists and two rebounds over 18 efficient minutes off the bench.

Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo paced the Bulls (30-30) with matching 19-point efforts, with the latter achieving his scoring in 24 minutes off the bench. Wade added six assists and four rebounds, while Rondo dished out five assists, hauled in four boards and recorded three steals. Bobby Portis stepped up with 12 points, six rebounds, one assist and three steals. Robin Lopez supplied 10 points, four assists, three boards and two blocks. Butler supplemented his aforementioned scoring total with four rebounds, three assists and three steals.

The Nuggets continue their trek through the Midwest with a Wednesday night showdown against the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Bulls remain home and await the Golden State Warriors on Thursday evening.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Phoenix Suns, 130-112, at FedEx Forum on Tuesday.

Despite the lopsided scoreline, this was an intense battle for the first 30-plus minutes. In fact, there were five ties and 10 lead changes in the first three quarters, with neither team leading by more than 10 points. Memphis turned it on in the second half though, outscoring Phoenix, 75-56. The Grizzlies had their best offensive game of the season, as they shot 56 percent from the field and 48 percent from three-point range. They also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle, 39-32. 

The Suns (18-42) continue to struggle, as they've now lost 13 of their last 16 games. Eric Bledsoe led the way for Phoenix, as he tallied 20 points, five rebounds, eight assists and two steals. T.J. Warren finished second on the team with 17 points and six rebounds on 8-of-13 shooting. Devin Booker really struggled, as he could only muster up nine points, three rebounds and one assist on 3-of-11 shooting in 35 minutes. Phoenix will host the Charlotte Hornets for their next game on Thursday. 

The Grizzlies (36-25) had lost their last two games at home, so this bounce-back blowout is just what the doctor ordered. Mike Conley led Memphis with 29 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Marc Gasol wasn't far behind, as he collected 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Zach Randolph was huge off the bench, providing 23 points and eight rebounds on 10-of-15 shooting. The Grizzlies will play the Dallas Mavericks for their next game on Friday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Utah Jazz 109-106 Tuesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena. 

For majority of Tuesday's contest, it looked as if the Thunder (35-25) would be having no problems handling the Jazz (37-23), as they entered the final period with a comfortable 11-point lead thanks in large part to their hot shooting start where, as a team, Oklahoma City hit 14 of their first 15 shots from behind the arc. Nevertheless, an 18-2 Utah run not only brought them back into the game, but gave them a three-point lead with just over two minutes remaining. From there, Russell Westbrook completely took over the game, scoring the next 10 points for the Thunder, which was topped off with a game-winning three-point play.

Westbrook finished with yet another triple-double of 43 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 38 minutes. It was his third straight triple-double, but it wasn't all Westbrook Tuesday night, as the Thunder also got a pair of impressive performances off the bench. Doug McDermott had a great shooting night, hitting four of his six shots from outside en route to scoring 16 points with Enes Kanter adding 15 points of his own off the bench.

For the Jazz, it was a solid team effort with six different players managing to score in double figures. All-Star Gordon Hayward led the way scoring for them, scoring 19 points but on just 7-of-17 shooting from the field. Rodney Hood added 18 points, while Rudy Gobert notched a double-double of 13 points and 10 rebounds. 

Up next, the Thunder will look to extend their win streak to five at Portland on Thursday, while the Jazz will return home Wednesday to take on the Timberwolves.

												The visiting Charlotte Hornets took down the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 109-104.

Both teams entered the game struggling, but Charlotte (26-34) was able to pull out the win in the game's final minute.  The Hornets are just 3-8 in their last 11 games, but saw some life on Tuesday.  All-Star point guard Kemba Walker led the team with a stellar 30 points while dishing out seven assists.  One of those assists came on a three-pointer from Marvin Williams to seal the win.  Sophomore big man Frank Kaminsky, meanwhile, scored an impressive 24 points and pulled down a team-high 12 rebounds.  One of the major factors for Charlotte in the win was three-point shooting, as the team shot 41 percent from beyond the arc for 16 triples.  

Los Angeles (19-42), meanwhile, is in the midst of a five-game losing streak.  The loss was actually fairly promising for the Lakers, as five players scored in double figures including 23 apiece for sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell and third-year big man Julius Randle.  However, trading Sixth Man of the Year front-runner Lou Williams has left a vacancy in the Lakers' bench production.  While guard Jordan Clarkson saw 16 points, it was a fairly unproductive night for the remainder of LA's second unit.  As a team, LA shot 49 percent from the field but could not match Charlotte's three-point shooting and reached the free-throw line just 13 times.  

The Hornets will visit the Suns on Thursday, while LA will visit their historic rival, the Boston Celtics on Friday.

Whenever other major components of their respective teams are sidelined, the spotlight shines particularly bright on DeMar DeRozan and Carmelo Anthony. With Kyle Lowry set to miss the remainder of the regular season due to wrist surgery and Kristaps Porzingis missing multiple games with an ankle injury, such a scenario is presently playing itself out for the pair of superstars. Unsurprisingly, they both are responding in impressive fashion, and fittingly, the outcome of Monday's contest ended up in the hands of both players. In what was a back-and-forth fourth period, DeRozan gave the Raptors (36-24) a 92-91 lead with one second remaining with an 18-foot basket. That left the Knicks (24-36) with one possession and they naturally opted to get the ball into the hands of Anthony. The perennial All-Star went for broke, putting up a 25-foot three-point jumper at the buzzer that failed to find the net, clinching the hard-fought road win for Toronto.

DeRozan compiled a game-high 37 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, two assists and one steal. With DeRozan putting up 25 shots, Serge Ibaka was a distant second  with 15 points, four rebounds and one block. Jonas Valanciunas totaled 10 points, five boards, two steals and one block. DeMarre Carroll supplied nine points, five boards and a pair of dimes. Cory Joseph, now presumably the starting point guard for the remainder of the campaign, contributed a modest six points, four assists, three rebounds and two steals over 34 minutes.

Anthony paced the Knicks with 24 points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal. Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee were next with matching 16-points efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, four assists and two steals, and the latter supplying three rebounds, three assists, five steals and two blocks. Lance Thomas drew another start for Porzingis and registered 12 points and six boards. Willy Hernangomez, now also a potential long-term starter with Joakim Noah out several weeks after a knee procedure, posted eight points, nine boards, two assists and one steal.

The Raptors head back home to tangle with the Wizards on Wednesday evening, while the Knicks hit the road for a Wednesday night matchup against the Orlando Magic.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Philadelphia 76ers, 119-108, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday.

Golden State was expected to win this game easily against a shorthanded Sixers team and they took care of business in relatively routine fashion. Philadelphia couldn't get out of their own way, as they were destroyed by turnovers and fouls. In fact, the Sixers committed 25 fouls and allowed the Warriors to take 39 free-throw attempts, while converting on 33 of them. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with Golden State recording seven more assists than the Sixers, while committing nine less turnovers. The third quarter is when Golden State put distance between them and Philly, as they outscored the Sixers, 34-24. 

The Warriors (50-9) were the first team to clinch a playoff berth last week and this win guaranteed another 50-win season. Kevin Durant led the way for Golden State, as he tallied 27 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Klay Thompson finished second on the team with 21 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Steph Curry went just 7-of-23 from the field, but still accumulated 19 points, four rebounds, six assists and two steals. Draymond Green provided 14 points, six rebounds, 11 assists and five steals in an all-around gem. Zaza Pachulia was extremely efficient, as he totaled 16 points and five rebounds on 5-of-5 shooting in just 14 minutes of action. The Warriors will continue their road trip on Tuesday when they play the Washington Wizards for their next game.

The Sixers (22-37) had a tough task here without Joel Embiid and they simply didn't have enough bullets in the arsenal to defeat this potent Warriors bunch. Dario Saric was Philly's best player, as he collected 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the defeat. Robert Covington finished with 15 points, eight rebounds, two assists and four steals. Jahlil Okafor had a game to forget, as he amassed just four points and three rebounds in 17 minutes, while committing a season-high seven turnovers. Richaun Holmes, Sergio Rodriguez and Nik Stauskas combined for 35 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists of the bench. The Sixers will return to action on Wednesday in a road matchup with the Miami Heat.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 102-95 Monday at Quicken Loans Arena.

The Bucks (26-32) managed to hang around for majority of Monday's contest, entering the fourth quarter down just four points. That's when the Cavaliers (40-17) decided to turn it on, however, as they opened up the lead to as large as 11 points late in the final period and managed to hold on. Kyrie Irving led the way scoring, finishing with a game-high 25 points and nine assists, while LeBron James wasn't too far behind with 24 points, 10 rebounds and six assists of his own. The most crucial performance for Cleveland, however, came from Derrick Williams, who continues to be a productive late-season signing for this team. Williams finished with 14 points on 5-of-7 shooting and seven rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench. 

For Milwaukee, it was a brutal game for their starting five, as Michael Beasley was the only starter to score in double figures with 11 points, but he left the game after nine minutes with a knee injury and didn't return. The other four Bucks starters combined to score just 27, with the glaring performance coming from Giannis Antetokounmpo, who scored just nine points in 42 minutes. Thankfully for Milwaukee, the bench unit picked up the starters' slack and were led by a solid performance from rookie Malcolm Brogdon, who scored a game-high 20 points and dished out five assists in 31 minutes. Now, the Bucks, after entering the All-Star break on a three-game winning streak, have dropped two of their last three outings.

Up next, the Cavaliers will head to Boston on Wednesday for a matchup between Eastern Conference powers, while the Bucks will head home Wednesday to play the Nuggets.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Boston Celtics 114-98 Monday at TD Garden. 

It was pretty much all Hawks (33-26) from start to finish, as Atlanta managed to end an ugly three-game skid with a big road victory. It was a complete team effort for the Hawks, as all five starters managed to score in double figures and combine for 82 of the team's 114 points. Dennis Schroder, who made his first start since the All-Star break, led the way for Atlanta with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting from the field to go along with five assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes. The starting frontline of Dwight Howard and Paul Millsap each added a double-double, with Howard notching 17 points and 12 rebounds and Millsap adding 17 and 10. The victory comes after the Hawks dropped three games in a row by a total of 52 points. 

As for the Celtics (38-22), they've now officially hit a slump in what has been a successful season, losing three of their last four games. It was a poor shooting night from the whole team, as they combined to hit just 39 percent of their shots from the field and 29.4 percent of their three-pointers. Isaiah Thomas did lead the way for the Celtics with 19 points, although it came on a brutal 4-of-21 shooting from the field. Other than Thomas, Marcus Smart (16) and Jaylen Brown (15) were the only other players to reach double-digit scoring Monday.

Up next, the Hawks will head home Wednesday to take on the Mavericks, while the Celtics will look to turn things around at home against the Cavaliers on Wednesday.

												The host Dallas Mavericks took down the Miami Heat on Monday, 96-89.

The Mavericks (24-35) have now won two straight after taking down the Pelicans on Saturday.  On Monday, guard Seth Curry almost bested a recently-set career high of 31 points.  Curry led the team with 29 and looked a lot like his brother, splashing home five three-pointers on seven attempts.  Veteran Dirk Nowitzki, meanwhile, scored only eight but had an impressive 12 rebounds to lead the team.  Only two players scored in double figures, with Harrison Barnes scoring 24 on 9-of-18 shooting.  The Mavs shot just 43 percent from the field, but hit 50 percent of their three-pointers on the night.  

Miami (27-33) had a rough night offensively.  The team scored under 90 points and shot just 45 percent and 36 percent from beyond the arc.  Point guard Goran Dragic shot 10-of-21 to lead the team with 24 points while also dishing out six assists.  Star center Hassan Whiteside, meanwhile, dominated with 19 points and an astounding 19 rebounds.  Despite Whiteside's dominance, the Heat still had a mediocre night on the boards.

												The visiting Indiana Pacers took down the Houston Rockets on Monday, 117-108.

Indiana (31-29) squeaked out the win over a tough Houston team.  The Pacers currently sit amidst a wide-open Eastern Conference playoff race, and Monday's win will certainly help them as they jockey for positioning.  It was a surprisingly lackluster night for star forward Paul George, who had just 15 points on 5-of-16 shooting.  However, point guard Jeff Teague dominated the game, scoring 25 points to go with eight rebounds and six assists. The Pacers held a massive edge on the glass, out-rebounding Houston 55-39.  Indiana also shot a stellar 45 percent while holding the Rockets to just 36 percent.

Houston (42-19) had a lackluster night on the offensive end, shooting just 36 percent from the field on the night.  Superstar James Harden went just 5-of-17 from the field, contributing to the Rockets' sub-par shooting night.  It was still a fair night for Harden, who scored 25 points and dished out 12 assists.  Harden also scored his 13,000th career point during the game.  Lou Williams, a new addition to the Rockets' roster, scored a team-high 28 points off the bench.

On Wednesday, the Pacers will visit San Antonio, while the Rockets will visit the LA Clippers.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Sacramento Kings 102-88 at Golden 1 Center on Monday. 

The Timberwolves (24-36) picked up just their ninth road win of the season with a relatively easy task in handling the depleted Kings (22-35) roster. Minnesota took advantage of an explosive second quarter where they scored 40 points and held the Kings to just 19 points, and the halftime lead was not able to be punctured by Sacramento throughout the rest of the contest. 

Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns overmatched whatever Sacramento tried to send their way, as the duo combined for 56 points. Wiggins finished with 27 points, four rebounds and one assist on 10-of-22 shooting, while Towns added 29 points, 17 rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Rebounding was what kept the Kings out of reach as Gorgui Dieng added 10 boards, and the Wolves totaled 52 as a unit, to just the Kings 42 rebounds. 

All five Kings starters did finish in double figures scoring, with three tying for the team lead of 14 points. Kosta Koufos, Ben McLemore and Willie Cauley-Stein shared 14 points a piece, while Darren Collison and Ty Lawson pitched in 10 points and 11 points respectively. Koufos rounded out his 14 points with 11 rebounds to finish the double-double. 

Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Kings visit the Brooklyn Nets, while the Timberwolves host the Utah Jazz.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 119-98, at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Lakers (19-41) generated a renewed sense of optimism with the hiring of the legendary Magic Johnson to the President of Basketball Operations post at the All-Star break, but the harsh reality of an upstart squad has manifested itself since then. Los Angeles has now lost all three games of the Magic era following Sunday's defeat, which saw them get dominated in all phases. The Spurs (45-13) shot 52.1 percent from the field and 47.6 percent from three-point range, while also eliciting 18 turnovers from their over-matched hosts. 

Kawhi Leonard led the way for San Antonio with 25 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds and one assist. LaMarcus Aldridge followed with 16 points, nine boards and one assist. Pau Gasol came off the bench to tally 15 points, seven rebounds, one steal and one block. Dewayne Dedmon continued to run with the first unit, supplying 11 points, nine boards, three assists and one steal. Tony Parker generated a near double-double with eight points, nine assists and three rebounds. Patty Mills and Kyle Anderson led the second unit with matching nine-point efforts. 

Brandon Ingram paced the Lakers with a career-high 22 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds and one block. Jordan Clarkson stepped up with a bench-leading 19 points, along with two rebounds and two assists. D'Angelo Russell was right behind him with 18 points, five boards, three assists and one steal. Julius Randle totaled a modest six points but he also hauled in 12 rebounds and dished out four dimes. Thomas Robinson turned in strong work off the bench with nine points, eight rebounds and four steals.

The Spurs head back home to face the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night, while the Lakers remain home and await the Charlotte Hornets for a Tuesday night showdown.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Phoenix Suns, 100-96, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Sunday

Despite there being just four ties and nine lead changes in this game, it was close throughout. In fact, neither team led by more than nine points, as the longest run was just 11 points. Free-throw shooting was one of the biggest factors in Milwaukee's win, as they went 16-of-18 from the charity stripe, while the Suns went 11-of-16. Both teams shot well, as the Bucks shot 51 percent from the field and the Suns hit 48 percent of their shots. Bench production was decisive as well, with Milwaukee winning that battle, 49-33.

The Suns (18-41) have struggled on the road all season, as this marks their 23rd road loss of the year. T.J. Warren led the way for Phoenix, as he dropped 23 points on 11-of-14 shooting. Eric Bledsoe finished with 11 points, four rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocks. Devin Booker finished second among starters, totaling 15 points, four rebounds and three assists. Alan Williams was a huge spark off the bench, as he provided 17 points, 15 rebounds, three assists and three steals. On deck for Phoenix is a road matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday.

The Bucks (26-31) have now won four of their last five games, as their January swoon seems to be far in the rear view mirror. Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load for Milwaukee, as he accumulated 28 points, eight rebounds, six assists and two blocks on 11-of-13 shooting. Tony Snell was the only other starter in double figures, as he amassed 13 points, three rebounds and two assists. Greg Monroe came off the bench to collect 13 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocks. Michael Beasley led the bench in scoring, as he dropped 17 points on 8-of-10 from the field. Milwaukee will look to keep rolling on Tuesday, in a road matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Denver Nuggets, 105-98, at Pepsi Center on Sunday evening.

The Grizzlies (35-25) utilized their tried-and-true formula -- solid defense and stellar play from their three most reliable veterans -- to hang on for a hard-fought road win. The improving Nuggets (26-33) hung tough through three quarters, and the two teams entered the final period knotted at 68. However, Mike Conley, who led the way with a game-high 31 points, scored 13 in the final 12 minutes to seal the win. Memphis also outrebounded Denver by a 49-39 margin and outscored their hosts 21-13 in second-chance points.

Conley supplemented his aforementioned scoring total with five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Marc Gasol was excellent in a supporting role, totaling 23 points, six assists and five boards, with his scoring total partly consisting of a trio of three-pointers. Zach Randolph led the bench with 20 points, 11 rebounds and two assists. JaMychal Green had a near double-double with nine points, 10 rebounds and one steal. The Grizzlies notably stuck with a tight rotation of just nine players, with Gasol and Conley playing 38 and 35 minutes, respectively.

The Nuggets saw all five members of their starting five hit double digits in the scoring column. Danilo Gallinari paced Denver with 24 points, four rebounds, one assist and two steals. Gary Harris continued his recent stretch of strong play with 19 points, three rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Wilson Chandler filled out the stat sheet with 14 points, nine boards, six assists and one steal. Jameer Nelson tallied 12 points, four assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Nikola Jokic posted a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included six assists, one steal and one block. Jamal Murray led the second unit with 11 points, four rebounds and one assist. 

The Grizzlies head back home to tangle with the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday evening, while the Nuggets head to the Windy City for a Tuesday night date with the Chicago Bulls.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Washington Wizards, 102-92, at Verizon Center on Sunday.

Washington have been one of the best home teams in the NBA this season, but this was a tough task against a feisty Utah team. The Jazz dominated from start to finish, as they led for over 42 minutes of this game and led by at least six points for the entirety of the second half. The second quarter is where they spread it out, outscoring the Wizards, 25-15. Rebounding was the glaring difference in the game, with Utah wining that battle, 52-27. They also dominated the points off turnover differential, winning that, 31-16.

The Jazz (37-22) have quietly been climbing up the standings and road wins like this should surely be opening other teams eyes. Gordon Hayward led the way for Utah, as he tallied 30 points, nine rebounds and two assists. George Hill wasn't far behind, finishing with 21 points, three rebounds and six assists. Rudy Gobert finished with another double-double, totaling 15 points, 20 rebounds, three assists and four blocks. On deck for the Jazz is a road matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.

The Wizards (34-23) had just seven losses at home coming into this matchup and this was easily their worst home performance of the season. John Wall did collect 30 points, 11 assists and four steals, but committed nine turnovers against this tough Utah defense. Bradley Beal was the only other starter in double figures, as he amassed 22 points, three rebounds and four assists. Bojan Bogdanovic led the bench, as he provided 15 points. Things don't get any easier, as Washington hosts the Golden State Warriors for their next game on Tuesday.

												The host Toronto Raptors edged out the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, 112-106.

Toronto (35-24) has now won three straight after a complete collapse during the month of January.  The Raps are tied with Washington for third in the East and trail Boston by three games for the second seed.  Despite missing star point guard Kyle Lowry, Toronto was able to hold on for the win on Sunday.  This was largely due to the play of All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who led the team with 33 points on 9-of-16 shooting and a stellar 15-of-16 from the free-throw line.  The Raptors offense as a whole functioned at a very high level throughout the game.  The team shot almost 54 percent from the field and saw an additional 18 points come from newly-added big man Serge Ibaka.  Ibaka also had 10 rebounds, two steals, and two blocks.

Portland (24-34) is quickly losing ground in the tight Western Conference playoff race.  Sunday did the team no favors, as they were defeated quite narrowly by the Lowry-less Raptors.  Damian Lillard led the team with 28 points and shot an efficient 10-of-20.  He added eight assists. The team was relatively quiet on the inside, due in part to center Jusuf Nurkic being limited to just 21 minutes of play.  Nurkic, a relatively new Trail Blazer who was acquired in a trade with deadline, had two teeth knocked out during a collision in the game.  It did not keep him out of commission for too long, however, as the young big man simply handed the teeth to a trainer and readied himself to play again.

The Blazers will visit Detroit on Tuesday while Toronto will see New York.

												The visiting Boston Celtics took down the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, 104-98.

Boston (38-21) was up by double digits for much of the game's middle portion but saw their lead dwindle towards the game's end.  The Celtics were actually down by a point with 45 seconds remaining, when a deep three-point miss with time on the shot clock from Detroit's Reggie Jackson allowed Boston to take possession and the lead.  On the other end, rookie Jaylen Brown hit a game-clinching three-pointer while being fouled.  Brown finished the night with 13 points on 5-of-9 shooting.  All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas was, per usual, the team's leading scorer.  Thomas scored 33 points and hit five three-pointers, helping to extend his streak of games with at least 20 points to 43.  As a team, the Celtics now are on the second-longest streak of games with at least 10 made three-pointers of all time, as the Cs have met the mark in 17 straight contests.

It was a disappointing night for Detroit (28-31), as the Pistons entered the game having won five of their last seven contests.  It was also the jersey retirement celebration for legendary Pistons guard Richard ""Rip"" Hamilton.  The Pistons were unable to treat Hamilton to a win, however, despite a valiant comeback effort.  Perhaps the biggest hang-up for Detroit was free-throw shooting, as the team went a miserable 16-of-35 from the free-throw line.  A big piece of that was center Andre Drummond, who went just 1-of-11 at the stripe.  Drummond is the worst career free-throw shooter in the league's history at just over 38 percent during his time in the association.  

Boston will host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, while Detroit will host the Trail Blazers on Tuesday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans 118-110, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday evening. 

The Pelicans started off well, leading 35-32 after the first quarter but went on to fall short in each of the remaining three quarters. Meanwhile, history was made in a couple of ways, as Russell Westbrook tied Wilt Chamberlain for second-most 40-point triple-doubles, while notching his 29th triple-double of the season. On another note, Anthony Davis set a Pelicans franchise record with 24 points in the first quarter. 

This marks the third straight win for the Thunder (34-25), as they have won both their games after the break. The Thunder shot 47.7 percent from the field and out-rebounded the Pelicans by 18. Russell Westbrook led the way for Oklahoma City with 41 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds, in 37 minutes. Enes Kanter followed up with 20 points in 24 minutes off the bench, while Alex Abrines and Steven Adams chipped in 13 points each. The Thunder go on to host the Jazz on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, this marks the Pelicans (23-37)  third straight loss in the DeMarcus Cousins era. Cousins and Anthony Davis continue to put up huge numbers but the lack of contribution from anywhere else is turning into a glaring problem. Davis led the way with 38 points, while Cousins followed up with 31. The only other player to score in double digits for New Orleans was E'Twaun Moore, who chipped in 10 points. The Pelicans will have a couple days to try to work things out before they go on to play host to the Pistons on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Charlotte Hornets in OT 124-121 at Staples Center on Sunday. 

The Clippers (36-23) are still tied with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 5-seed in the Western Conference, but pulled out a needed win with opening day starters on the court. Kemba Walker single handedly took the Hornets (25-34) to overtime after draining a 25-foot three-pointer to bring the game within two points with :36 remaining in the fourth quarter, and then finished the job at the free throw line on the next possession to tie the game at 113 points a piece. 

In OT, both teams went back-and-forth during the first two minutes, but the Hornets Marvin Williams fouled Blake Griffin and put him on the line to give the Clippers a one point lead. Walker's heroics at the end of the fourth quarter will be overshadowed by a bad pass that was stolen by DeAndre Jordan, who also finished with a dunk on the other end with a few ticks left on the clock. 

Blake Griffin had a monsterous game evidenced by his 43 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and two steals on 15-of-26 shooting across 42 minutes. Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan also stacked the box score. The Clippers star point guard finished with 15 points, 17 assists and nine rebounds, while Jordan scored 20 points and hauled in 19 rebounds. J.J. Reddick scored 19 points in the first half, but had trouble continuing the hot hand in the second half. Reddick finished with 22 points on 3-of-7 shooting from behind the arc. 

Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum led the Hornets in scoring with 34 points and 31 points, respectively, while Jeremy Lamb was effective off the bench in his 37 minutes of action. Batum was more well rounded in his performance and added eight rebounds and four assists. 

Next up, the Hornets host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Clippers visit the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 99-85, at Golden 1 Center on Saturday afternoon.

The Hornets (25-33) have been playing without the services of starting center Cody Zeller since late January due to his calf injury, but his absence has come with a silver lining. Second-year big man Frank Kaminsky III had taken the opportunity afforded him and parlayed it into a string of impressive performances, with the most recent having come in Saturday's contest against the new-look Kings (25-34). Kaminsky posted a 23-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included three assists and two steals to lead the way for Charlotte, his fifth straight double-digit scoring effort and third double-double in the last seven contests. His efforts on the glass spearheaded a 50-41 rebounding advantage for the visitors as they dominated a Sacramento team that clearly misses the departed DeMarcus Cousins on the glass.

Marvin Williams followed Kaminsky with 16 points, six rebounds, two steals and one block. Nicolas Batum was next with 15 points, six boards, three assists, one steal and one block. Marco Belinelli paced the bench with 13 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Kemba Walker provided 12 points, six assists, three rebounds and one steal in a supporting role that was somewhat uncharacteristic. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist couldn't muster much on the scoreboard with only six points but made up for it by hauling in 12 boards.

With Cousins now in New Orleans, it could well be a different player taking the offensive lead every night in Sacramento. Saturday was Ben McLemore's turn, as the two-guard led the way with 18 points, two rebounds and one steal. Newly-acquired Buddy Hield had his second strong effort in as many games in a Kings uniform, posting a bench-leading 15 points, as well as  two assists and one rebound. Anthony Tolliver and Tyreke Evans produced matching 11-point efforts, with the latter making his debut in the starting five. Tolliver added four boards and one assist, while Evans supplemented his scoring with five rebounds, five assists and a pair of blocks. Darren Collison was quiet by his standards, offering a modest 10 points, along with five assists, two rebounds and one steal. Promising rookie Skal Labissiere, now part of the rotation in the wake of Cousins' departure, supplied eight points, 13 rebounds, one assist and one steal in 23 minutes off the bench. 

The Hornets continue their trip through California with a visit to Los Angeles for a Sunday night date with the Clippers, while the Kings tangle with the Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Monday evening.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 105-86, at Amway Center on Saturday night.

The Magic (22-38) made one major move at the trade deadline, sending Serge Ibaka to the Raptors for swingman Terrence Ross. The latter found himself behind DeMar DeRozan and DeMarre Carroll at shooting guard and small forward, respectively, in Toronto. However, he's stepped right into the starting role at the three in his new digs, and the results have been impressive so far. Ross particularly shined Saturday, tallying 24 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block to lead the offense. The Magic also stymied the Hawks (32-26) on the other end of the floor, limiting them to respective 38.1 and 32.0 percent success rates from the floor and three-point range and also goading them into 17 turnovers. 

Tim Hardaway, Jr. spearheaded the Hawks' attack with a modest 15 points that he complemented with three rebounds and one steal. A quartet of 11-point efforts from Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap, Taurean Prince and Dennis Schroder followed. Howard added 14 rebounds, one assist and one block against one of his former squads; Millsap supplemented his scoring with seven rebounds, two assists and one block; Prince also hauled in four boards and recorded a steal and a block; Schroder, coming off the bench after serving a one-game team suspension Friday, supplied eight assists, five rebounds and one block. Newly-acquired Ersan Ilyasova mustered only five points but posted 10 rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench.

Ross was seconded by Aaron Gordon, who went for 18 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Nikola Vucevic, who'd been questionable coming in with a sore Achilles, nevertheless tallied a 16-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included an assist, two steals and two blocks. Elfrid Payton had a near triple-double with 15 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocks. D.J. Augustin led the bench with eight points and two assists.

The Hawks head to Boston to take on the Celtics on Monday night, while Orlando is off until Wednesday night, when they'll take on the New York Knicks at home.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 110-109, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night. 

The Sixers (22-36) have shown drastic improvement this season, often giving teams all they can handle even on nights when they come up short. Their fighting spirit was on full display Saturday, as they came back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to take a 109-108 lead with nine seconds remaining on a Jahlil Okafor jumper. However, Carmelo Anthony wouldn't allow the struggling Knicks (24-35) to go down for the seventh time in the last eight games, nailing a baseline jumper over Robert Covington with 0.3 seconds left to seal the home win. New York prevailed despite being outrebounded 50-44, a deficit they made up for by shooting a solid 47.2 percent success rate from the floor.

Okafor spearheaded the Sixers with 28 points, which he complemented with 10 rebounds and one assist. Covington continued his torrid start to the second half of the season, tallying a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists, three steals and two blocks. Dario Saric turned in 19 points, 15 rebounds and five assists. Nik Stauskas led the bench with 14 points, three boards and one block. 

Anthony posted a team-high 37 points, along with six rebounds, two assists and one block. Derrick Rose managed 18 points, five boards and three assists. Lance Thomas and Willy Hernangomez drew starts for Kristaps Porzingis (ankle) and Joakim Noah (hamstring), respectively, and generated matching 11-point efforts. Thomas also registered six boards and two assists, while Hernangomez hauled in nine boards, dished out one assist and recorded a pair of blocks. Justin Holiday paced the second unit with 14 points, seven rebounds and two blocks, and Kyle O'Quinn, getting some extra run due to the aforementioned frontcourt absences, supplied nine points, five rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocks.

The Sixers head back home to tangle with the Golden State Warriors on Monday night, while the Knicks remain home and await the Toronto Raptors for a Monday night showdown.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers, 113-95, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday night. 

After a mostly dismal first two months of the season, the light appeared to come on for the Heat (27-32) in mid-January and it's yet to be extinguished. Miami rattled off victories in 14 of 16 games leading into the All-Star break, and have now begun the second half with two straight wins. The Pacers (30-29), who've largely been heading the opposite direction lately, stumbled yet again, posting a sub-par 40 percent success rate and committing 15 turnovers. The Heat had three players eclipse the 20-point mark while shooting a superb 48.9 percent overall. 

The Pacers were led by Myles Turner, who tallied 18 points, seven boards, one assist, two steals and one block. Jeff Teague supplied 16 points, six assists, three rebounds and one steal. Slam Dunk Contest champ Glenn Robinson III paced the second unit with 13 points, five rebounds and one steal. Rodney Stuckey was productive in a reserve role as well, managing 12 points, three assists, one rebound and two steals. Paul George struggled for the second straight game, producing 10 points, one rebound and one assist. C.J. Miles provided eight points and five rebounds in his start at shooting guard. 

Hassan Whiteside and Dion Waiters co-led the Heat with matching 22-point efforts. Whiteside also brought in 17 rebounds and recorded a steal and block apiece, while Waiters had three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Goran Dragic followed closely behind with 21 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals. Luke Babbitt registered nine points, three rebounds, one assist and one steal.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 96-83, at American Airlines Center on Saturday. 

These are two teams on the outside looking in for the playoffs and the Mavericks were able to escape with a huge win to get them closer to that eight-seed. Despite New Orleans leading by six points after the first quarter, Dallas took care of business from there by winning the other three quarters by at least four points. In fact, the Mavericks outscored the Pelicans, 49-34, in the second half. Defense was key, as they held New Orleans to 40 percent from the field and 21 percent from three-point range, while forcing 19 turnovers. 

The Pelicans (23-36) now have two double-digit losses since acquiring DeMarcus Cousins and the growing pains are slower than most anticipated. Anthony Davis stepped up though, as he led the team with 39 points and 14 rebounds. Cousins finished with just 12 points, but provided 15 rebounds, six assists and three steals. Jrue Holiday was the only other Pelican in double figures, as he collected 18 points, seven rebounds and six assists. The other six players combined for just 14 points, nine rebounds, nine assists and no blocks. 

The Mavericks (23-35) have been surging since a terrible start and a win over a growing team like the Pelicans is just what they need to get some momentum going. Harrison Barnes led the way, as he tallied 19 points, three rebounds and three steals. Dirk Nowitzki finished second on the team, totaling 18 points and nine rebounds. Seth Curry and Yogi Ferrell combined for 20 points, 12 rebounds and 15 assists as the starting backcourt. Nerlens Noel made his debut and amassed nine points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Salah Mejri had a historically bad game, as he fouled out in five minutes, while failing to record a single stat aside from a turnover.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 117-99, at Quicken Loans Arena on Saturday.

Chicago had been struggling prior to the break, but a road win over a 40-win team is an impressive feat. The third quarter was the decisive stretch, as Chicago outscored Cleveland, 34-20. The assist-to-turnover ratio was a huge factor as well, as the Bulls recorded 34 assists to seven turnovers, while the Cavaliers committed 12 turnovers to 24 assists. Chicago had one of their best three-point shooting games of the year too, going 15-of-30 from long distance, which marks a season-high in makes. There were 11 ties and 13 lead changes in total, as this game was tight throughout the first three quarters. 

The Bulls (30-29) are now 2-0 out of the All-Star break and it appears that break is all they needed to get going. Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade carried the load, as they combined for 38 points, 19 rebounds and 20 assists, while they each flirted with a triple-double. Butler finished with a triple-double, totaling 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while Wade accumulated 20 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists of his own. Nikola Mirotic was a huge spark off the bench, as he provided 14 points and 10 rebounds. Rajon Rondo also played well off the bench, collecting 15 points and five assists. 

The Cavaliers (40-17) had to play this game without LeBron James (sickness) and it's clear just how much he means to this team with a loss like this. With Kevin Love also out, Kyrie Irving had to carry the load, as he led the team with 34 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. The other four starters combined for just 29 points. Kyle Korver and James Jones were sharpshooting off the bench, as they scored 14 points a piece, while combining to go 8-of-12 from three-point range. .

The Bulls are now 3-0 against the Cavaliers this season.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 142-130, at Toyota Center on Saturday. 

Three-point shooting has become customary in this new style of NBA, but the Rockets continue to fire at an unbelievable pace. In this game, Houston went 22-of-58 from three-point range, while the Timberwolves went just 9-of-26. Minnesota dominated the rebounding though, winning that battle, 58-31. Houston abused the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording four more assists and 10 less turnovers than Minnesota. This was a wire-to-wire win for the Rockets, as they led by at least seven points for the final 20 minutes. 

The Timberwolves (23-36) had beat two playoff contenders in their last two games, but this was a tough task against a potent Houston offense. Karl-Anthony Towns was a beast in the loss, as he led the team with 37 points and 22 rebounds on 16-of-24 from the field. Andrew Wiggins wasn't far behind, as he tallied 30 points and three steals. Gorgui Dieng finished third on the team, totaling 16 points, 13 rebounds and three steals on 7-of-10 shooting. Ricky Rubio accrued 14 points and 11 assists, but did commit six turnovers. 

The Rockets (42-18) have now won six of their last seven games, as they continue to fire up three's at will. James Harden led the way for Houston, as he accumulated 24 points, five rebounds and 10 assists. Ryan Anderson was second among starters, finishing with 18 points, two rebounds and three assists. Clint Capela started and amassed 16 points and nine rebounds on 7-of-9 shooting. All five starters scored at least 15 points. Eric Gordon and Lou Williams came off the bench to combine for 31 points, six assists and five steals. 

Both teams return to action on Monday, as the Rockets host the Indiana Pacers and the Minnesota Timberwolves play the Sacramento Kings on the road.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-95, at Oracle Arena on Saturday.

Golden State was expected to win this game easily with a 22-point spread and they took care of business. A 10-0 run to end the second quarter was a huge stretch, as it gave the Warriors an 11-point lead, which they never relinquished from there. It was a near wire-to-wire win, as Brooklyn's only lead was a one-point advantage for less than a minute in the second quarter. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive, as the Warriors recorded five more assists than the Nets, while committing five less turnovers. Golden State also dominated the rim protection, as they recorded 11 blocks to Brooklyn's three. 

The Nets (8-49) had a nearly impossible task here, but they did a nice job of hanging around and giving the Warriors a battle. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was a bright spot, as he accrued 16 points and 10 rebounds in the defeat. Brook Lopez really struggled, as he could only muster up nine points, four rebounds and five assists, while committing four turnovers on 3-of-13 shooting. Sean Kilpatrick was a nice spark off the bench, providing 15 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Trevor Booker recorded a double-double off the bench as well, amassing 12 points and 10 rebounds. On deck for Brooklyn is a road matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday. 

The Warriors (49-9) have made minced meat of much of the league this season and a home matchup against an eight-win Nets team is simply unfair. Stephen Curry led the team with 27 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals in the absence of Kevin Durant. Klay Thompson accumulated 24 points, four rebounds and four assists. Zaza Pachulia totaled eight points and nine rebounds, while nearly shutting out Brook Lopez. Golden State will face the Philadelphia 76ers on the road for their next game on Monday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Washington Wizards, 120-112, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday evening. 

The Sixers' first game after the All-Star break featured Dario Saric's debut as the permanent starting power forward, and the 2014 first-round pick did not disappoint. Saric contributed a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included four assists and one steal. All five members of the Sixers (22-35) starting five posted double-digit scoring, and Philadelphia managed a 49.4 percent success rate from the floor in an explosive offensive showing overall. The impressive effort helped the home team overcome a spectacular 40-point effort from the Wizards' Bradley Beal.

Beal added four rebounds, two assists and two steals to his game-high scoring total. John Wall was right behind with a 29-point, 14-assist double-double that also included eight boards and a pair of blocks. Markieff Morris was a distant third for the Wizards (34-22), generating 14 points, seven rebounds and one steal. Marcin Gortat compiled an 11-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one assist and one block. 

Robert Covington paced the Sixers with 25 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and four steals. Gerald Henderson tallied 20 points and five boards. Richaun Holmes, seeing an expanded role off the bench with the departures of Nerlens Noel and Ersan Ilyasova at the trade deadline, supplied 12 points, 10 rebounds, one assist, five blocks and two steals. Jahlik Okafor and Nik Stauskas produced matching 11-point efforts, with the former adding two rebounds and two assists, and the latter registering three boards, one assist and one block. T.J. McConnell amassed 10 points, eight assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block.

The Wizards head back home to tangle with the Utah Jazz on Sunday afternoon, while the Sixers head to New York to take on the Knicks on Saturday evening.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 102-92, at FedEx Forum on Friday. 

Despite this game being close throughout the first quarter, the Pacers dominated the rest of the way. The second and third quarters were especially decisive, outscoring the Grizzlies 64-42 in that 24-minute stretch. Free-throw shooting really killed Memphis, as they went just 13-of-23, while the Pacers went a perfect 11-of-11. Indiana also dominated the shooting, hitting 51 percent of their shots, while holding Memphis to 41 percent. The Pacers also won the rebounding differential, 50-39. 

The Grizzlies (34-25) have now lost three of their last four games, as this was not how they wanted to start their stretch run. Despite playing just 14 minutes off the bench, Troy Daniels led the team with 13 points. Marc Gasol led the starters, as he accumulated 12 points, four rebounds and four assists. Mike Conley finished with 10 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Tony Allen accrued 11 points, seven rebounds and five steals. On deck for the Grizzlies is a road matchup with the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.

The Pacers (30-28) had lost six-straight headed into this matchup, so a blowout win is just what the doctor ordered. C.J. Miles led Indiana in scoring, as he dropped 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting. Jeff Teague went just 2-of-8 from the field, but totaled 10 points and 10 assists en route to a double-double. Monta Ellis was a nice spark off the bench, providing 16 points and three assists. The Pacers will be in action again on Saturday against the Miami Heat.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Boston Celtics, 107-97, at Air Canada Centre on Friday evening.

The Raptors (34-24) found out earlier in the day that star point guard Kyle Lowry would miss the game with a right wrist injury. That thrust Cory Joseph into the starting five, and, as is often the case when Lowry misses, shone a brighter spotlight on his backcourt mate DeMar DeRozan. However, his absence was also partly made up for Friday by the debuting Serge Ibaka, who was playing his first game in a Toronto uniform following his trade from the Orlando Magic. The tightly-contested affair saw the Celtics (37-21) enter the fourth period holding a slim 77-74 lead, but the home team mounted a comeback, outscoring their visitors by a 33-20 margin over the final 12 minutes.

Isaiah Thomas once again led Boston, posting 20 points, five assists and three rebounds. However, he struggled with his shot, going 6-of-17 overall from the field, including 3-of-10 from behind the arc. Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart followed with matching 19-point efforts, with the former adding four rebounds and one assist, and the latter supplying five rebounds and four assists over 32 minutes off the bench. Jaylen Brown drew another start at shooting guard for Avery Bradley (Achilles) and produced 13 points, two assists, one steal and one block. Al Horford turned in a modest stat line of eight points, five rebounds, one assist and one steal.

DeRozan paced the Raptors with a spectacular career-high 43-point tally that he supplemented with five rebounds and five assists, With Lowry out of the lineup, DeRozan took 28 shot attempts overall, draining 15, and also visited the charity stripe a game-high 12 times. Ibaka was impressive in his debut, supplying 15 points, seven rebounds, one steal and one block. Joseph did a solid job filling in at point guard, amassing 11 points, six assists, one rebound and three steals. Patrick Patterson led the bench with 11 points, two rebounds and one assist, while P.J. Tucker, also making his Raptors debut, generated nine points, 10 boards, one assist and a trio of steals.

The Celtics head to the Motor City for a Sunday afternoon showdown with the Detroit Pistons, while the Raptors remain home to tangle with the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday as well.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Phoenix Suns in overtime, 128-121, on Friday evening at United Center. 

The Bulls (29-29) found themselves down 102-91 with 4:31 remaining following a Devin Booker three-pointer, but mounted an impressive comeback that eventually saw them forge a 106-106 tie with 48 seconds left after a Jimmy Butler trey. Butler then added a 13-foot two-pointer at the nine-second mark that gave Chicago a momentary 108-106 lead. However, Booker had a chance to seal the win with one second on the scoreboard after he was fouled by Dwyane Wade in three-point range, yet he missed the last of three subsequent free throws to send the contest into overtime knotted at 108. Wade made up for his late gaffe in the extra period, tallying half of the Bulls' 20 points to seal the victory.

The Suns (18-40) were led by Booker, who posted 27 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Eric Bledsoe, T.J. Warren and Marquese Chriss followed with a trio of 17-point efforts. Bledsoe added 10 assists, seven rebounds, one steal and one block; Warren, now in primary possession of the small forward job with P.J. Tucker traded to Toronto, complemented his scoring total with eight boards, two assists and two steals; Chriss also registered seven boards, one assist, two steals and two blocks. Alex Len produced a modest four points and seven rebounds as the starting center, but Alan Williams led the bench with 16 points, three boards and one assist. 

Wade's 23 points paced Chicago, and he added four rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Butler compiled 22 points, nine assists, three rebounds and four steals. Robin Lopez totaled 19 points, six boards and one block. Nikola Mirotic led the second unit with 20 points, eight rebounds and two assists over 37 minutes. With Taj Gibson now in Oklahoma City, Mirotic, who drained four of his five baskets from long range, could be in for similar playing time going forward. Denzel Valentine was productive in a reserve role as well, posting 15 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals over 34 minutes.

The Suns remain in the Midwest and next head to Milwaukee to tangle with the Bucks on Sunday afternoon, while the Bulls head to Cleveland for a Saturday night, national TV showdown against the Cavaliers.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 109-95, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday. 

The Jazz stifled the Bucks just a few weeks ago and they put it to them yet again here. Utah took care of business down low, as they dominated the rebounding and points in the paint differentials. In fact, Utah won the rebounding battle, 42-35 and the points in the paint differential, 52-34. The Jazz ended up shooting 50 percent from the field, while holding the Bucks to 43 percent. The Jazz were up by at least eight points for the final 32 minutes. 

The Jazz (36-22) have been one of the best teams in the league over recent weeks and they came out of the All-Star break with some fury. Gordon Hayward continued his barrage, as he led the team with 29 points, three rebounds and four assists. Derrick Favors finished second on the team with 19 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Rudy Gobert added another double-double to his tally, amassing 15 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks. George Hill finished with 19 points and four steals, going 8-of-8 from the free-throw line. 

The Bucks (25-31) went into the All-Star break with three-straight wins, but this loss was more indicative of their prior form.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 110-93, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday.

Oklahoma City was expected to win this game easily and they took care of business against a struggling Lakers team. The Thunder actually won all four quarters, as they led for the final 44 minutes. Defense was key for the Thunder, as they held the Lakers to under 40 percent from the field and just 20 percent from three-point range. Los Angeles also hurt themselves with free-throw shooting, as they went just 6-of-14 from the charity stripe. 

The Lakers (19-40) have just seven wins on the road for the entirety of the season and this defeat added to their road struggles. D'Angelo Russell was a lone bright spot, as he led the team with 29 points, four rebounds and six assists. Julius Randle totaled 13 points, 11 rebounds and three assists. Jordan Clarkson led the bench with 14 points, five rebounds, five assists and four steals. Things don't get any easier for Los Angeles, as they play the San Antonio Spurs for their next game on Saturday. 

The Thunder (33-25) have a new-look squad after the All-Star break, but Russell Westbrook continues to stack up the triple-doubles. Westbrook collected 17 points, 18 rebounds and 17 assists, despite going going just 4-of-18 from the field. Steven Adams recorded a double-double, accumulating 15 points, 10 rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocks. Alex Abrines and Andre Roberson scored 19 points a piece, combing to go 15-of-22 from the field. Oklahoma City will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday for their next game.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 97-84, at Target Center on Friday. 

In a battle between two teams looking to vie for the eight-seed in the west, Minnesota prevailed with a big win. They took care of busines from start to finish, as the T'Wolves led for over 45 minutes of this game. Defense carried Minnesota, as they held Dallas to 42 percent from the field and 24 percent from three-point range. The Timberwolves also dominated down low, winning the rebounding battle, 44-35 and the points in the paint differential, 48-30.

The Mavericks (22-35) have struggled on offense all season and duds like this against a bad Minnesota defense only adds to those troubles. Seth Curry had the game of his life though, dropping a career-high 31 points on 13-of-17 shooting. Harrison Barnes was the only other Maverick in double figures, as he totaled 20 points, six rebounds and two steals. Dirk Nowitzki accumulated eight points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. 

The Timberwolves (23-35) continue to battle for a playoff berth and wins like this over teams who are ahead of them are imperative for that pursuit. Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota in scoring, as he amassed 27 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Karl-Anthony Towns was the most valuable player, as he collected 26 points and 18 rebounds on 12-of-18 shooting. Ricky Rubio finished third on the team, totaling 13 points, five rebounds, 14 assists and three steals.

												The visiting Miami Heat handily defeated the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, 108-90.

The Heat (25-32) entered the All-Star break as one of the league's hottest teams, having won 14 of their last 16 games.  Miami added to the wins column again on Friday in what was a well-rounded team effort.  Six members of the team scored in double-digits, including 23 for bench guard Tyler Johnson.  Another big point of emphasis in the win was rebounding, where the Heat held a big edge.  Miami finished the game with a 54-45 advantage on the glass.  Although the team shot just 40 percent from the field, Miami moved the ball exceptionally well.  The Heat notched 30 assists on the night.  

Atlanta (32-25) is in the thick of a tight Eastern Conference playoff race.  On Friday, though, the team saw a fairly dismal outcome, as the 18-point loss came in their first game back from the All-Star break.  Though Miami was held to just 40 percent shooting, the Hawks dipped below that total, hitting just 38 percent of their shots from the field.  All-Star Paul Millsap had a relatively strong game on the offensive end, scoring 21 points and shooting 6-of-9.  However, he came away with just four rebounds, contributing heavily to Atlanta's problems on the boards.

The Hawks will visit Orlando on Saturday, while Miami will host the Pacers.

												The host Denver Nuggets cruised past the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, 129-109.

It was smooth sailing for Denver (26-32), who earned a bounce-back win after falling to the Kings on Thursday night.  Like Thursday night, however, star Denver center Nikola Jokic was a complete non-factor.  The 21-year-old played only 14 minutes and picked up four fouls while scoring only two points.  A big night from Jokic wasn't necessary for Denver's success, though, as three Nuggets scored at least 20 points on the night.  The team's high-scorer was shooting guard Gary Harris, who posted 25 points.  Overall, Denver shot a stellar 50 percent from the field including 14 three-pointers and held a nine-rebound advantage on the glass.  

Brooklyn (9-48), meanwhile, appears far from getting back on track.  While injuries to key players such as Jeremy Lin have played a role, the Nets have simply performed at a low level throughout the season.  Brooklyn has now lost 15 consecutive games and remains significantly behind in the Eastern Conference standings.  On Friday, the team saw a fairly respectable offensive night but a miserable defensive one.  The Nets shot over 49 percent but were outscored by 20.  A big issue for Brooklyn was turnovers, as the team coughed the ball up 19 times on the night.  

The Nets will visit Golden State on Saturday, while Denver will host the Grizzlies on Sunday.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs took down the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, 105-97.

San Antonio (44-13) has now won three straight games and continues to sit comfortably as the second seed in the Western Conference.  Veteran big man Pau Gasol has spent much of the season on the sidelines after suffering a broken finer, but returned in stellar fashion on Friday.  Gasol earned a double-double, recording 17 points and 11 rebounds along with a blocked shot.  As per usual in San Antonio, the leading scorer was superstar forward Kawhi Leonard, who had 21 points on the night.  It was a below-average offensive night for the Spurs, but the team made up for it with solid defense.   San Antonio held LA to under 100 points while grabbing nine steals and blocking seven shots.  

The Clippers (35-23), meanwhile, followed a blown lead against Golden State on Thursday with a disappointing loss to the Spurs on Friday.  The two adversaries made for a difficult back-to-back, though All-Star forward Blake Griffin appeared full of energy against San Antonio.  Griffin was the game's high scorer with 29 points on 9-of-17 shooting.  He added nine rebounds and five assists.  The Clippers had a tough time shooting the ball overall, hitting just 44 percent of their shots and only making seven three-pointers on the night.  

On Sunday, the Spurs will visit the Los Angeles Lakers, while the Clippers will host the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Orlando Magic, 112-103, at Amway Center on Thursday night. 

The arrival of Jusuf Nurkic is certainly an important development, but the Blazers' (24-33) offense undeniably runs through the prolific backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. The dynamic pair combined for 55 of Portland's 112 points to spearhead the road win, and the visitors used stellar shooting  (50.6 percent overall, 47.4 percent from long range) to overcome 19 turnovers. It was a come-from-behind victory for the Blazers, as they'd trailed the Magic (21-38) by a 55-46 margin at halftime. They were particularly spectacular in the final quarter, as they outscored Orlando, 35-18, over the final 12 minutes.

Lillard's 33 points paced Portland, a total that he supplemented with five boards and two assists. McCollum followed with 22 points, six assists, one rebound, two steals and one block. Nurkic and Maurice Harkless contributed matching 12-point efforts, with the former also hauling in 12 boards, dishing out five assists, recording three steals and posting a pair of blocks, and the latter supplying six rebounds, one assist, three blocks and one steal. Shabazz Napier led the second unit with 10 points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals.

Nikola Vucevic led the way for the Magic with 25 points, nine rebounds, two assists and one block. Evan Fournier contributed 20 points, five rebounds, two assists and one steal. Terrence Ross, drawing his first start in an Orlando uniform, tallied 13 points, five rebounds, one assist and three steals. Aaron Gordon went for a near double-double, providing nine points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Mario Hezonja spearheaded the bench with 10 points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. 

The Blazers next head north to take on the Toronto Raptors on Sunday afternoon, while Orlando remains home to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday evening.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Charlotte Hornets 114-108 Thursday in overtime at the Palace in Auburn Hills. 

The Hornets (24-33) actually held the lead for majority of Thursday's contest, as they entered halftime with a 12-point lead and the fourth quarter with a 15-point lead. But a big run from the Pistons (28-30) in the final period, which included some great back-and-forth between Kemba Walker and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in the closing moments, ultimately forced the game into overtime. From there, it was all Detroit as Caldwell-Pope carried them through the final five minutes. Caldwell-Pope hit seven three-pointers en route to scoring a game-high 33 points and grabbing nine rebounds in 43 minutes. Detroit also got yet another great performance off the bench from Tobias Harris, who scored 25 points on 9-of-17 shooting from the field in 37 minutes as a reserve. 

Walker did everything he could for the Hornets in the closing moments, matching every punch Caldwell-Pope threw at him and his team. He finished with a game-high 34 points, seven rebounds and six assists in 42 minutes, but unfortunately for Charlotte, it wasn't enough. The loss results in the fifth straight loss for the Hornets and their 12th loss in their last 13 games. Every starter for Charlotte managed to score in double figures Thursday, but the team's bench unit continues to be a problem for this team, as the four players who saw minutes off the bench scored just 14 points on 6-of-21 shooting from the field. 

Up next, the Pistons will remain home Sunday to take on the Celtics, while the Hornets will look to end their losing streak Saturday against the Kings.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 129-99 Thursday at Smoothie King Center.

The Rockets (41-18) wasted no time spoiling the homecoming of the new-look Pelicans (23-35), as New Orleans only managed to stick around for one quarter, as Houston managed to open up 16-point lead heading into halftime and never looked back. Leading the way for the Rockets was a player who has only been on the team for a couple of days. In his first game as a Rocket, Lou Williams posted a team-high 27 points in just 25 minutes off the bench. Williams' only competition for Sixth Man of the Year this season, Eric Gordon, wasn't too far behind, scoring 19 points in 30 minutes as a reserve Thursday. Those two led the way for a now-revamped bench unit that carried Houston all game long, as seven bench players combined to score 79 points and made up for an underwhelming performance from James Harden, who had just 13 points in 30 minutes. 

As for the Pelicans, the daunting frontcourt of Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins did their job, but the rest of the team struggled. Davis led the way with a team-high 29 points and nine rebounds, while Cousins posted his first double-double as a Pelican, recording 27 points, 14 rebounds, fives assists, five steals and four blocks in 35 minutes. The only other New Orleans player who managed to score in double figures was Omri Casspi, who was playing his first career game in a Pelicans uniform and finished with 12 points. In the end, it was New Orleans' horrid outing from behind the arc that prevented the Pelicans from making this game close, as they shot just 6-of-31 from long range Thursday night.

Up next, the Rockets will head home Saturday to take on the Timberwolves, while the Pelicans will look to turn things around Saturday in Dallas.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the New York Knicks, 119-104, at Quicken Loans Arena on Thursday.

Cleveland has now beat New York in 10-straight games, as they continue to own the Knicks. It was the second and fourth quarters that were decisive, as Cleveland outscored New York, 67-43 in that 24-minute span. The Cavaliers ended up shooting 53 percent from the field, while holding the Knicks to just 42 percent from the field. A 42-28 differential in the paint was huge as well, as Cleveland dominated down low.

The Knicks (23-35) were surprisingly quiet at the trade deadline and this result is no surprise with the recent form of these two teams. Courtney Lee was New York's best player, as he led the team with 25 points, six rebounds and five assists on 10-of-15 shooting. Carmelo Anthony finished second on the team with 20 points, five rebounds and five assists. Wily Hernangomez got the start at center and totaled 11 points, 10 rebounds and four assists en route to a double-double. The Knicks will host the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday for their next game. 

The Cavaliers (40-16) have now won nine of their last 11 games, as they continue to surge. LeBron James added another triple-double to his tally, as he accumulated 18 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists. Kyrie Irving led the team in scoring, as he provided 23 points, three rebounds and six assists. Tristan Thompson was a beast down low, amassing 10 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks on 5-of-7 shooting. Kyle Korver came off the bench to collect 20 points, two rebounds and three assists, while going 6-of-10 from three-point range. Cleveland will return to action on Saturday against the Chicago Bulls.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, 123-113.  

Golden State (48-9) scored 50 points in the third quarter after entering the second half down by double-digits.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry was the spark behind the scoring surge, as he finished the game with a team-high 35 points and six three-pointers.  His fellow ""Splash Brother,"" Klay Thompson, scored another 18 points and made two threes.  Former MVP Kevin Durant led the team with 15 rebounds and had another 25 points and seven assists.  While three of the Warriors' four All-Stars saw solid output, forward Draymond Green had a weak night.  Green was called for a technical foul and committed six turnovers while scoring only seven points.  Nevertheless, it was another great night for the powerhouse Warriors, who have now won 10 of their last 12 games.  

Los Angeles (35-22) stayed in the game for about two and a half quarters before allowing the game to get out of hand.  The Clippers saw a rare bit of offensive dominance in the first half from center DeAndre Jordan, who had 13 points in the first half.  Jordan slowed down considerably, however, finishing the night with 17 points and 11 rebounds.  All-Star Blake Griffin also went cold, finishing the night with just 12 points on 3-of-13 shooting.  

LA will host the Spurs on Friday, while the Warriors will face the Nets on Saturday.

												The host Sacramento Kings took down the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets on Thursday, 116-100.

The game was the first for Sacramento (25-33) since the team dealt superstar center DeMarcus Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night.  Rookie shooting guard Buddy Hield, the reigning sixth overall pick and centerpiece of the trade, made a strong debut on Thursday, scoring 16 points and shooting an efficient 6-of-10 from the field.  It was sophomore center Willie Cauley-Stein, however, who made the strongest impression in the new-look Kings lineup.  After spending the first part of his career playing alongside or behind Cousins in the rotation, Cauley-Stein had a breakout game on Thursday, scoring 29 points on 14-of-22 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds.  Despite dealing Cousins and veteran forward Rudy Gay (achilles) being out for the remainder of the season. the Kings saw a high-functioning offense against Denver.  The team shot over 52 percent from the field and made half its three-point attempts.  

Denver (25-32) was left disappointed by the outcome, as the Nuggets were blown out by a gutted Kings team.   One of the biggest obstacles for Denver was overcoming the defense of Sacramento's Willie Cauley-Stein.  The Kings successfully hounded the Nuggets all night and held Denver's star center, Nikola Jokic, to just four points on the night.  Denver shot only 44 percent and was out-rebounded by seven in the game.  The team's high scorer was shooting guard Gary Harris with 23 points.  

Denver will host the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while Sacramento will host the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Indiana Pacers, 111-98, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Thursday evening. 

The Pacers (29-28) came in to Thursday's contest hoping to snap a five-game losing streak, but were also running on fumes after two games in the previous three nights. Fatigue may have played a role in the first half, as the Wizards (34-21) built a 62-52 lead by halftime. The second half was much tighter, but Washington eventually pulled away on the strength of a highly productive night for their starting five. All first unit members hit double digits in the scoring column, and the Wizards managed to shoot 51.8 percent from the field overall, as well as a superb 51.7 percent on their 29 shots from behind the arc. 

Otto Porter, Jr. led the way with 25 points, eight rebounds, two assists and one block. Markieff Morris managed 21 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. John Wall followed with a trademark double-double, posting 20 points, 12 assists, two rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Bradley Beal was right behind with 19 points, four assists, three rebounds and one steal. Marcin Gorat contributed 12 points seven rebounds and one steal. 

Matching 17-point efforts from Myles Turner and Paul George led the Pacers, with the former adding nine rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block, and the latter providing seven boards, three assists and two steals. Al Jefferson and Rodney Stuckey were next with a pair of 12-point tallies off the bench. Jefferson added three rebounds and Stuckey dished out a pair of assists and recorded a steal. Glenn Robinson III went for 10 points, while Kevin Seraphin drew the start at power forward and supplied nine points, five rebounds and one assist.

The Wizards resume post-All-Star-break play in Philadelphia against the Sixers on Friday, February 24th, while the Pacers kick off the second half of their season on the same night at home against the Memphis Grizzlies.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Boston Celtics, 104-103, at United Center on Thursday. 

In the final game before the All-Star break, these two teams left it all on the floor. In fact, there were eight ties and 14 lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 10 points. Jimmy Butler was the hero, as he hit two clutch free-throws with less than a second left to seal the win. Free-throw shooting was a key for Chicago all night, as they went a perfect 22-of-22 from the free-throw line. Rebounding was the decisive statistic though, with the Bulls winning that differential, 51-31. 

The Celtics (37-20) have been one of the hottest teams over recent weeks, but they'll head into the All-Star break with a devastating loss. Isaiah Thomas led the team once again, as he tallied 29 points, three rebounds and seven assists. No other starter had more than 10 points, with Marcus Smart, Al Horford and Jae Crowder combining to go 7-of-22 from the field. Kelly Olynyk came off the bench to provide 17 points, seven rebounds and four assists. 

The Bulls (28-29) are slowly climbing back to .500 and this win may be what they need to go on a run over the final couple months. Jimmy Butler led the way, as he accumulated 29 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Bobby Portis finished second on the team, collecting 19 points and eight rebounds off the bench. Robin Lopez fell just shy of a double-double, totaling 15 points and eight rebounds. Rajon Rondo had a strange line, as he went scoreless, but grabbed seven rebounds and dished out eight assists off the bench.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Orlando Magic, 107-79, at Amway Center on Wednesday evening.

The Spurs (43-13) set the tone early, jumping out to a 30-16 lead after one quarter that they wouldn't come close to relinquishing. LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard spearheaded the offensive effort, but defense was the story of the night for San Antonio. They clamped down on a Magic (21-37) team that lost significant offensive firepower with the trade of Serge Ibaka to Toronto by holding them to 37 first-half points, and paltry success rates of 39.5 percent from the field and 22.2 percent from three-point range. Orlando also committed 17 turnovers on the night and saw only three players hit double digits in the scoring column.

Aldridge paced the Spurs with a game-high 23 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block. Leonard was right behind him with 22 points, five rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Dewayne Dedmon continued a successful stretch of starts with a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one assist and one block. Patty Mills led the bench with 13 points, six assists, two rebounds and two steals.

Nikola Vucevic's 16-point, 10-rebound double-double led the Magic. He also recorded a block. Jeff Green and Aaron Gordon turned in matching 11-point efforts, with the former adding three rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block and the latter supplying six rebounds, two assists and one block. Evan Fournier provided nine points, five rebounds, five assists and one steal. Mario Hezonja led the Orlando second unit with eight points, one rebound, one assist, one steal and one block.

The Spurs are off until Friday night, February 24th, when they'll kick off the second half of the season in Los Angeles versus the Clippers. The Magic next take the court at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday, February 23rd.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 113-104, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday. 

The final scoreline indicates a somewhat lopsided game, but this was much closer than it looks. It was actually a tied ball game early in the fourth quarter, before Cleveland went on a 23-6 run to open things up. What the Cavaliers did especially well was limit mistakes, as they committed just eight turnovers and allowed the Pacers to record just three combined blocks and steals. Despite Indiana shooting a better percentage from three, the Cavaliers lived there, going 18-of-39 from long distance in their win. 

The Pacers (29-27) have now lost five-straight, as the All-Star break couldn't come at a better time. Glenn Robinson III led the team in scoring, as he dropped 19 points to go along with six rebounds. Paul George really struggled, as he went just 4-of-19 from the field to accrue 13 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Jeff Teague was their best player, collecting 15 points, four rebounds and 11 assists. Myles Turner finished with 15 points and seven rebounds on 7-of-12 shooting. Monta Ellis was a nice spark off the bench, providing 14 points and seven assists. 

The Cavaliers (39-16) have now won nine of their last 11 games, as they continue to surge headed into the All-Star break. LeBron James was the catalyst once again, as he accumulated 31 points, five rebounds and four assists on 12-of-17 shooting. Kyrie Irving was equally as good, tallying 26 points, two rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Kyle Korver came off the bench to provide 22 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals on 6-of-8 from three-point range. Tristan Thompson recorded a 12-point, 12-rebound double-double.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 116-108, at TD Garden on Wednesday evening.

In keeping with the considerable improvement they've demonstrated this season, the Sixers (21-35) gave the Celtics (37-19) all they could handle on their home court. They matched their hosts point for point in the first half, forging a 61-61 tie at intermission. Boston was finally able to gain a measure of separation in the third quarter, which was key to the victory. The Celtics enjoyed a very productive shooting night, tallying a 47.5 percent success rate from the field and 46.4 percent from three-point range. That helped them overcome a very poor performance in the turnover department, as they gave the ball away a whopping 22 times, a total that was matched by the Sixers. 

Dario Saric continued to provide excellent returns off the bench for Philadelphia, scoring a team-high 20 points in 33 minutes. He added 11 rebounds, one steal and one block. Robert Covington nearly accomplished a double-double of his own with 18 points, nine rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block. Nerlens Noel totaled 16 points, seven boards, three assists and three steals. T.J. McConnell provided 12 points, eight assists, three rebounds and five steals. Gerald Henderson supplied 11 points and a pair of steals. Nik Stauskas was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, five rebounds and one assist.

Isaiah Thomas unsurprisingly led the way again for Boston with a game-high 33 points that  he supplemented with four rebounds and three assists. Marcus Smart enjoyed a superb offensive night while drawing the start at shooting guard, totaling 21 points, five rebounds, five assists, a jaw-dropping eight steals and one block. Jae Crowder stepped up with 18 points, five rebounds, two assists and one steal. Al Horford registered 12 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Kelly Olynyk led the second unit with 16 points, seven boards, three assists and one steal. James Young managed 10 points, three rebounds, one steal and one block in 22 minutes off the bench.

The Sixers kick off the second half of the season at home against the Washington Wizards on Friday, February 24th, while the Celtics head to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Thursday evening to close out the first half of their season.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 90-85, at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday evening.

The game came down to starkly contrasting third and fourth quarters, with the Raptors (33-24) catching fire at the right time and making a memorable comeback for the victory. Toronto got things off on the right foot, building a 31-20 lead after one quarter. However, the Hornets (24-32) put together a stellar defensive effort over the middle periods, limiting their hosts to just 27 points in the second and third quarters combined, while scoring 34 themselves in the third quarter alone. That surge gave them a seemingly dominant 75-58 edge heading into the final period, but the light went on for the Raptors at that point. They turned the tables on their visitors by limiting Charlotte to just 10 points in the fourth quarter and putting up 32 themselves, allowing them to escape with an improbable home victory and snap a three-game skid. 

The Hornets were led by a spectacular 27-point tally from Frank Kaminsky, which he supplemented with five rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Kemba Walker was next with a near double-double of 24 points, nine assists, four boards and two steals. Nicolas Batum turned in 10 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist posted six points but also hauled in 14 rebounds, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and registered a pair of blocks. Jeremy Lamb led the second unit with a modest six points.

Kyle Lowry's 21 points paced the Raptors, and he added six rebounds, six assists and one steal. Norman Powell drew the start and managed 17 points, two rebounds and three steals. DeMarre Carroll produced a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double while drawing the start at power forward with the newly acquired Serge Ibaka not suiting up. He added four assists and one steal. DeMar DeRozan endured a nightmarish evening from the field, shooting just 5-of-19 on the way to a 10-point tally, which he complemented with three rebounds and two assists. Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan's scoring total and hauled in 11 boards, dished out one assist and recorded one steal. Delon Wright led the bench with 11 points, two assists, one rebound, two steals and one block.

The Hornets resume post-All-Star-break play when they visit the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, February 23rd, while the Raptors kick off the second half by doing battle with the Boston Celtics at home on Friday evening, February 24th.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 129-125, at Barclay's Center on Wednesday.

Despite there being just four ties and six lead changes in this game, it came down to the final seconds. It took a late run for Brooklyn to get back into the game though, as Milwaukee outscored Brooklyn by 11 in the third quarter, but they outscored the Bucks by nine in the fourth to cut the lead to four. The Bucks led for the entirety of the second half though, as Brooklyn couldn't muster up enough stops to take a lead. Milwaukee's offense was cruising, as they recorded 27 assists on 57 percent shooting from the field and 47 percent from three-point range. The Bucks 16 steals was a huge factor as well, as they won the turnover differential, 17-10. 

The Bucks (25-30) are now carrying a three-game winning streak into the All-Star break, as they continue to fight for a playoff berth. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the player of the game, as he tallied 33 points, nine rebounds, three assists and four steals. Greg Monroe was second on the team, providing 25 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two steals on 12-of-16 shooting off the bench. Khris Middleton recorded season-highs across the board, as he accumulated 20 points, three rebounds, seven assists and three steals in 25 minutes of action. 

The Nets (9-47) have now lost 14-straight, as they simply can't get any stops on the defensive end. Brook Lopez did all he could for Brooklyn, as he led the team with 36 points, four rebounds and eight blocks. Spencer Dinwiddie was second on the team, amassing 19 points, five rebounds and eight assists, Trevor Booker was huge off the bench, providing 18 points, five rebounds and three assists on 7-of-8 shooting,											",Brooklyn,Nets,Milwaukee,Bucks,Barclays Center,25,30,9,47,10.0,30.0,41.0,79.0,19.0,23.0,41.0,28.0,17.0,7.0,15.0,50.0,88.0,22.0,32.0,39.0,27.0,10.0,Bojan Bogdanovic,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,6.0,12.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,30,Giannis Antetokounmpo,9.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,33.0,13.0,25.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,39,Rondae Hollis-Jefferson,10.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,19,Michael Beasley,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Brook Lopez,4.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,36.0,12.0,20.0,6.0,10.0,0.0,35,Thon Maker,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13,Randy Foye,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,16,Tony Snell,6.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,33,Spencer Dinwiddie,5.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,19.0,7.0,12.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,26,Matthew Dellavedova,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,32,Sean Kilpatrick,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,18,Greg Monroe,8.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,25.0,12.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,33,Trevor Booker,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,18.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,27,Khris Middleton,3.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,20.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,25,Isaiah Whitehead,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,17,Malcolm Brogdon,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,15,Justin Hamilton,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,13,Rashad Vaughn,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,17,Caris LeVert,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,13,Mirza Teletovic,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 98-91, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday. 

This game looked like a laugher early on, but Dallas made a late run in the second half for a respectable scoreline. Detroit actually took a game-high 27-point lead headed into the half, but Dallas got it all the way down to a seven-point deficit, which happened to be the final margin. It was a wire-to-wire win for the Pistons, as they led by at least seven points for the final 44 minutes. Defense was key, as they held Dallas to 39 percent from the field and 28 percent from three-point range. Rebounding was the biggest factor for Detroit though, winning that battle, 57-38.

The Mavericks (22-34) simply dug themselves too big of a hole in this game and it's not how they wanted to head into the All-star break. Dirk Nowitzki had a renaissance game though, as he led the team with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Harrison Barnes finished second on the team with 16 points and five rebounds. Seth Curry totaled 13 points, two rebounds, three assists and two steals, while Deron Williams collected 12 points, and six assists.

The Pistons (27-30) early lead carried them to this win, but it wasn't the prettiest of victories. Reggie Jackson put an end to his slump, as he led the team with 22 points, four assists and two steals. Jon Leuer was second on the team, accruing 20 points and eight rebounds.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies, 95-91, at FedEx Forum on Wednesday.

These teams have gone to overtime the last three times they faced one another and this matchup nearly hit extra time once again. The Pelicans actually led for the final 38 minutes, as it took a 30-18 fourth quarter for the Grizzlies to make it a game. New Orleans got it done with defense, as they held Memphis to 37 percent from the field (33-of-89) and 18 percent from three-point range (6-of-33). The Pelicans shot 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range on their end, despite being dominated in rebounding and second-chance points. 

The Pelicans (23-34) are battling to remain in the playoff hunt and road wins like this are necessary to achieve that goal. Solomon Hill was the surprising hero, as he led the team with 23 points, five rebounds and two steals on 8-of-11 from the field. Jrue Holiday was second on the team, finishing with 19 points, seven rebounds and seven assists on 8-of-13 shooting. Anthony Davis scored just four points in the first half, but still accrued 18 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks for the game. Alexis Ajinca was the only other Pelican in double figures, as he amassed 12 points, 10 rebounds, three steals and two blocks. 

The Grizzlies (34-24) have been disappointing on offense all season and they were let down by it once again here. Mike Conley led Memphis in scoring, as he collected 17 points, two rebounds and four assists. Zach Randolph was second on the team, providing 16 points and nine rebounds off the bench. Marc Gasol was the only other Memphis player in double figures, as he accumulated 15 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists in a near triple-double.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Houston Rockets, 117-109, at Toyota Center on Wednesday evening. 

The Heat (25-32) had finally cooled off just slightly after a torrid 13-game winning streak with two consecutive losses coming in to Wednesday, and the probability of a third straight defeat loomed large considering the quality of their opponent and the hostile venue. However, Miami assured themselves of heading into the All-Star break on a positive note with a spectacular shooting night and consistent effort across all four quarters. The Heat posted a 52.4 percent success rate from the field, with four members of the first unit managing double digits in the scoring column. Meanwhile, while James Harden did generate 38-point, 12-rebound, 12-assist triple-double that also included a block, the Rockets (40-18) saw the other four members of their starting five combine for just 41 points, and Houston shot just 41.4 percent from the field overall. 

Hassan Whiteside and Dion Waiters led the way for the Heat with matching 23-point efforts. Whiteside also hauled in 14 rebounds, dished out one assist, and recorded five blocks, while Waiters added nine rebounds and seven assists. Goran Dragic was right behind his teammates with 21 points, five assists and one rebound. Rodney McGruder supplied 11 points, two assists, one rebound and two steals. Tyler Johnson paced the second unit with 16 points, seven boards and four assists.

Ryan Anderson was a distant second behind Harden with 17 points, six rebounds and one assist. Clint Capela was the only other member of the starting five to hit double digits, posting 12 points and two rebounds. Eric Gordon matched Capela's point total and added two rebounds, two assists and one steal in 32 minutes off the bench. Patrick Beverley and Trevor Ariza notably combined for just 12 points, with the former exiting after just 12 minutes with a strained left groin muscle. 

The Heat resume play after the All-Star break in Atlanta on February 24th when they'll do battle with the Hawks. The Rockets will next take the floor in New Orleans against the Pelicans on Thursday, February 23rd.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Denver Nuggets 112-99 Wednesday at Pepsi Center.

The Timberwolves (22-35) got a morale-boosting victory Wednesday night in their final game before the All-Star break, as they have now gone 3-2 in their last five games. For that, they have Andrew Wiggins to thank, as he once again carried Minnesota offensively for the entire night. He finished with 40 points -- his second 40-plus performance in a row -- on 15-of-26 shooting from the field. Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points of his own to go along with 19 rebounds as the duo once again accounted for over half of their team's points. Shabazz Muhammed ended up being the only other Timberwolves player to score in double figures, as he scored 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench.

For the Nuggets (25-31), they suffered a bit of a letdown following their dominating victory over the league-best Warriors on Tuesday. They ended up shooting just over 40 percent from the field and not one player in particular was able to get into any sort of rhythm offensively. Gary Harris led the way scoring for Denver with 22 points, while Jameer Nelson and Nikola Jokic each managed to record double-doubles in the outing. Nelson finished with 16 points and a game-high 11 assists, while Jokic notched 15 points and 14 rebounds. The Nuggets have now won every other game over their last seven contests heading into the All-Star break, but they remain the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference standings.

												The host Utah Jazz demolished the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, 111-88.

Utah (33-22) entered the All-Star Break on a high note, blowing out the Blazers and reaching 11 games above .500.  The Jazz were firing on all cylinders as they took Portland down, as the team shot 52 percent with six players scoring in double figures.  All-Star Gordon Hayward scored a team-high 22 points while also grabbing six rebounds and dishing seven assists.  Per usual, center Rudy Gobert backed up Hayward's scoring with dynamic defense and a solid effort on the glass.  Gobert had 12 rebounds and blocked three shots.  

Portland (23-33) was as cold as Utah was hot.  The Blazers shot an unimpressive 40 percent from the field, a large part of which was due to severe struggled from star point guard Damian Lillard.  Lillard shot a hideous 3-of-19 from the field, ending with just 13 points.  It was a stellar Blazers debut, however, for recently-acquired big man Jusuf Nurkic.  Nurkic impressed off the bench, scoring 13 points and coming down with seven rebounds and three steals.  The Nuggets, who dealt Nurkic to the Blazers earlier in the week, saw stellar play from former Blazer Mason Plumlee in his Denver debut.  Thus far, both teams should be happy with their new big men's performance.  

Both teams will enter the All-Star Break.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 137-101 Wednesday at Talking Stick Resort Arena. 

It didn't take long for the Suns to grab ahold of this game, as they managed to open the game on a 27-8 run and never looked back. After winning the opening quarter by 17 points, Phoenix continued to pile it on and effectively ended the game by halftime. The Suns' backcourt was efficient and dominant offensively in the victory, with Eric Bledsoe leading the way with a triple-double of 25 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds. Devin Booker added 23 points of his own on 9-of-14 shooting from the field and 4-of-7 shooting from behind the arc. In the end, all 13 Phoenix players managed to score against a struggling Lakers (19-39) defense. 

Those Lakers have now dropped two games in a row and three of their last four following Wednesday's embarrassing defeat that ended with the team shooting just 37.6 percent from the field. Lou Williams was one of the lone bright spots for Los Angeles, as he increased his trade value yet again with 21 points off the bench on 7-of-13 shooting from the field. D'Angelo Russell added 21 points of his own, but he shot a subpar 7-of-20 from the field Wednesday. With the loss, the Lakers sit just a half-game behind the Suns for the worst record in the West but remain nine games behind the Nets for the worst record in the NBA.

												The host Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 17-point deficit to beat the New York Knicks on Wednesday, 116-105.

Oklahoma City (32-25) once again saw All-Star Russell Westbrook put the team on his back on Wednesday, as he scored 38 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 12 assists.  Westbrook, often criticized for his efficiency, shot 13-of-22 from the field and 3-of-5 from three-point range.  It was also a big night from young guard Victor Oladipo, who scored 21 points on 9-of-17 shooting.  The team shot a stellar 47 percent from the field and took an edge at the free-throw line and on the glass.  The Thunder made 22 free-throws and held a 10-rebound advantage.  

The Knicks (23-34) have now lost five of their last six games.  After taking an early 17-point lead, the Knicks quickly let their defense fall apart on Wednesday, paving way for Westbrook to produce another signature scoring outburst.  Star forward Carmelo Anthony was named an All-Star reserve earlier in the night, and played like an All-Star in the game.   Anthony dropped 30 points and came away with four rebounds.  However, the Knicks were out-shot, out-rebounded, and got into foul trouble as a team.

Both teams will head into the All-Star Break.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Atlanta Hawks 99-84 Wednesday at Staples Center.

After going through some real struggles following Chris Paul's injury, the Clippers (35-21) now enter the All-Star break with plenty of momentum via a four-game winning streak, and Wednesday's victory was the walk-in-the-park the team likely preferred to have before their week off. It ended up being a complete team effort, with 11 total players getting in the scoring column and five different players managing to score in double figures. Blake Griffin led the way with 17 points, nine assists and five rebounds, while J.J. Redick added 15 points of his own. But it was the bench mob that ended up playing a crucial role in the team's victory, accounting for 42 of the team's 99 points Wednesday. Thanks to the four-game win streak, the Clippers now sit a half-game ahead of the Jazz for fourth place in the Western Conference.

As for the Hawks (32-24), it was the final game of their three-game West-coast road trip, and it resulted in a fairly lackluster effort from the team. While all 13 Atlanta players that saw action got in the scoring column Wednesday, there were no standout performances in the defeat. Dwight Howard recorded a double-double of 11 points and 15 rebounds, while Dennis Schroeder led the way in the scoring column with 15 points to go along with seven assists. But with All-Star Paul Millsap shooting just 3-of-12 from the field en route to scoring just eight points, the team never really had a shot. 

Both teams still enter the break in the top five of their conference standings, with the Clippers resuming Feb. 23 against the Warriors and the Hawks returning to the court Feb 24 against the Heat.

												The host Golden State Warriors destroyed the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday, 109-86.

The game was close until the third quarter, when Golden State (47-9) pulled away with a massive 47-12 run.  Prior to the run, All-Star forward Draymond Green had been ejected from the game after arguing over a call he disagreed with.  Green's absence did not hinder the Warriors, however, as the ""splash brothers"" helped lead a massive run to earn the blowout victory.  Shooting guard Klay Thompson led the team with 35 points and also finished with five rebounds and four assists.  Former MVP Kevin Durant had 21 points to go along with seven rebounds and seven assists.  

Sacramento (24-33), meanwhile, had won four games in a row before Wednesday's rout.  On Wednesday, however, even superstar center DeMarcus Cousins struggled, scoring just 13 points and no points in the game's final 20 mnutes.  The team's top scorer was forward Matt Barnes with 15, but the contest ultimately proved to be far too lopsided for Sacramento to overcome.  The 42-15 third quarter was the worst quarter seen by any single team thus far this season.  

Both teams will enter the All-Star Break.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Toronto Raptors, 105-94, at United Center on Tuesday.

The Bulls (27-29) had looked rather hapless on Sunday against the Timberwolves while playing with a significantly short-handed squad. Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade, Nikola Mirotic and Paul Zipser all missed that contest, and matters didn't look much more optimistic heading into Tuesday's tilt. However, Butler was able to ultimately make a return from his heel injury, and his presence unsurprisingly made a considerable impact. The star forward posted a 19-point, 12-assist double-double that also included two rebounds and four steals over a full allotment of 38 minutes, and Doug McDermott actually led Chicago with a 20-point effort off the bench. The Bulls also overcame 17 turnovers by shooting a solid 47.9 percent from the field and 41.2 percent from three-point range. 

The Raptors (32-24) were led by Kyle Lowry, who produced 22 points, four assists, three rebounds and one steal. DeMar DeRozan followed with 18 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Norman Powell generated 13 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals. Jonas Valanciunas posted a near double-double of 12 points and nine boards. Cory Joseph was productive as a reserve as well with 10 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal. 

McDermott added five rebounds and one assist to his aforementioned team-high scoring total. Taj Gibson managed 14 points and four boards. Rajon Rondo was next with 12 points, four assists and three rebounds. Cristiano Felicio supplied 10 points, six rebounds, one assist and two steals. Michael Carter-Williams and Robin Lopez registered matching eight-point efforts on the starting five.

The Raptors head back home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday evening, while the Bulls remain home to take on the Boston Celtics on Thursday night.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-108 Tuesday at Target Center.

The Timberwolves (21-35) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers (38-16) for a majority of Tuesday's contest, and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game. That was until LeBron James hit a step back three-pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team's lead from three points to six. At that point, Minnesota was finished. James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10-of-14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games. Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own, Channing Frye posted a double-double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love's replacement and the newest Cavalier, Derrick Williams, came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday.

As for those Timberwolves, a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season. After scoring 20 points in the third quarter, Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16-of-29 shooting from the field. Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well, scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds, but besides those two, Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team. Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game-high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds, but he wasn't able to produce enough in the scoring column, ending with just five points on 2-of-8 shooting from the field. 

Up next, the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers, while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets.

												The Sacramento Kings took down the host Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 97-96.

Sacramento (24-32) has now won four games in a row, thanks in large part to All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins.  On Tuesday, Cousins absolutely dominated the Lakers' frontcourt, scoring 40 points to go along with 12 rebounds and eight assists.  Cousins reached the line an astounding 19 times, but made just 12 of his free-throw attempts.  Free-throws provided a major edge for the Kings, as the team hit 18 free-throws to Los Angeles's 8.  The game proved to be very even, as rebounding and turnover totals for the two teams were nearly identical.

Los Angeles (19-38) had trouble containing Cousins but saw excellent play from its guards and bench.  In particular, sixth man Lou Williams exploded for 29 points and five assists.  One of the more disappointing aspects of the night for the Lakers, though, were the struggles of second overall pick Brandon Ingram.  Ingram had just seven points on 2-of-7 shooting and 1-of-4 from the free-throw line.  One of those free-throw misses was an airball late in the tight game.  Not every Lakers was as cold as Ingram, however, as the team hit an impressive 12 three-pointers.

The Lakers will visit Phoenix on Wednesday, while the Kings will see Golden State.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 105-99, at Spectrum Center on Monday evening.

The Sixers (21-34) are clearly an improved team this season, and Monday's game was a tangible example of such. In past seasons, even a Philadelphia squad at full strength would have found a win on the road a near impossibility. Take out two key players and a 30-to-40-point defeat was a very real possibility. However, this season's unit is playing with a very different level of confidence, and that intangible was pivotal to the Sixers notching a hard-fought victory despite the absences of Joel Embiid (knee) and Jahlil Okafor (coach's decision). Six players managed double digits in the scoring column, and Philadelphia shot 47.7 percent from the field overall. They played strong defense as well, limiting the Hornets (24-31) to a 43.6 percent success rate from the field and 35.5 percent from three-point range. 

Dario Saric led the visitors overall with 18 points off the bench, which he supplemented with 11 boards, three assists and one block. Robert Covington tallied 17 points, five rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block. T.J. McConnell supplied 14 points, seven assists, four rebounds and one steal. Gerald Henderson and Nerlens Noel provided matching 12-point efforts, with the former adding four boards and one assist, and the latter registering seven boards, one assist, three steals and two blocks. Nik Stauskas generated 11 points, six rebounds, two assists and one steal.

Kemba Walker paced the Hornets with a game-high 29 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Nicolas Batum compiled 16 points, four assists, one rebound and two steals. Frank Kaminsky III posted a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists, three blocks and one steal. Jeremy Lamb led the second unit with 12 points and one steal. Marco Belinelli and Brian Roberts were productive as well with matching eight-point efforts.

The Sixers travel to Beantown for a Wednesday night date with the Boston Celtics, while the Hornets travel north of the border to tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday evening as well.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the host Indiana Pacers, 110-106, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday.

Indiana and San Antonio went all out in this matchup, as it was tight throughout. In fact, there were 12 ties and 14 lead changes, with neither team ever leading by double-digits. Rebounding was the difference in the game, with the Spurs winning that battle, 49-37. Free-throw shooting was decisive as well, with San Antonio going 23-of-27 and Indiana hitting just 21-of-30.

The Spurs (42-13) suffered a disappointing loss on Sunday to the New York Knicks, but they made a nice bounce back here in a tough road win. Kawhi Leonard carried the load once again, as he tallied 32 points, six rebounds, three assists and four steals. LaMarcus Aldridge went just 7-of-22 from the field, but finished second on the team with 19 points and seven rebounds. Dewayne Dedmon started at center and totaled six points and 12 rebounds. David Lee was a nice spark off the bench, providing 12 points and 11 rebounds. 

The Pacers (29-26) have now lost four-straight games, but this was easily their best effort in that stretch. Paul George led Indiana in scoring, as he collected 27 points, six rebounds and three assists. Myles Turner wasn't far behind, as he accumulated 22 points and six rebounds. Jeff Teague accrued 15 points, five rebounds and five assists. Rodney Stuckey and Monta Ellis combined for 23 points, six rebounds and seven assists off the bench.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-103, at Barclays Center on Monday night.

The Grizzlies (34-23) came in to Monday's contest a bit short-handed, as Tony Allen was given the night off to rest his 35-year-old body. Memphis took advantage of their matchup against the worst team in the league to rest their defensive stalwart, but lately, the Nets (9-46) have played hard regardless of the circumstances. That transpired once again Monday, as Brooklyn shot a very respectable 46.3 percent from the field and committed a relatively modest 12 turnovers, significantly less than their average. However, Mike Conley took the reins of the Grizzlies offense with a 32-point, six-assist, one-rebound, one-steal performance over 37 minutes, while also making a game-high 11 visits to the free-throw line. Five players hit double digits in the scoring column for the visitors, and they shot 50.6 percent from the field overall.

Marc Gasol checked in second with a near double-double of 19 points, nine rebounds, eight assists, one steal and one block. Brandan Wright stepped in with a season-high 17 points that paced the bench, a total he supplemented with three rebounds, one assist and one steal over 21 minutes. Vince Carter supplied 14 points, three rebounds, one assist and two steals as a reserve. JaMychal Green totaled 10 points and six boards. James Ennis drew the start for Allen but generated a modest five points and five rebounds

Brook Lopez and Spencer Dinwiddie led Brooklyn with matching 17-point efforts, with the former dishing out five assists, hauling in three rebounds and recording a steal, and the latter providing three boards and one assist. Sean Kilpatrick led the bench with 15 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson collected 13 points, three boards, two assists and two steals. Trevor Booker matched Hollis-Jefferson's scoring total and added four rebounds and a steal. Bojan Bogdanovic submitted 11 points, five rebounds and two assists. 

The Grizzlies head back home to face off with the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday evening, while the Nets remain home to tangle with the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the host Miami Heat, 116-107, at American Airlines Arena on Monday. 

Despite Orlando leading for nearly the entirety of this game, it was close throughout. In fact, it was a single-digit margin for over 40 minutes, as it came down to the final seconds. Three-point shooting was a huge factor for the Magic, as they went 8-of-14 from long range, while Miami hit just 6-of-22. Rebounding was decisive as well, with Orlando winning that battle, 52-37.

The Magic (21-36) had lost 16 of 20 headed into this game, so a road win against someone as hot as Miami has to be an encouraging sign. Evan Fouriner carried the load for Orlando, as he tallied 24 points and four assists on 10-of-17 from the field. Nikola Vucevic was equally as big, totaling 13 points, 17 rebounds, three assists and three steals. Serge Ibaka was second among starters in scoring, as he amassed 17 points and eight rebounds on 7-of-9 shooting. Elfrid Payton was huge off the bench, providing 20 points, five rebounds and four assists. On deck for the Magic is a home matchup against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.

The Heat (24-32) have now lost their last two games, which strangely came after a season-high 13-straight wins. Dion Waiters made his return from an ankle injury to lead the team with 23 points, two rebounds and six assists. Goran Dragic wasn't far behind, accruing 22 points and three rebounds. Hassan Whiteside recorded another double-double, collecting 12 points, 19 rebounds, two blocks and two steals. James Jonson and Tyler Johnson combined for 28 points, six rebounds and five assists off the bench. Miami will look to snap this small slide in a road game against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 120-98, at Verizon Center on Monday evening.

The Wizards (33-21) knew they'd have to hit on all cylinders to insure that they could keep pace with Russell Westbrook and company, and they managed to do that and then some Monday. Washington posted outstanding 57.5-and-61.9 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, while seeing six players tally double-digit scoring. Meanwhile, they did a superb defensive job on Westbrook, limiting him to a modest 17 points on 5-of-19 shooting, and the Thunder (31-25) to 35.4 percent shooting overall, including one stretch of 24 consecutive missed shots. Westbrook played just 24 minutes, as he sat for good in the third quarter. 

Westbrook added four rebounds, four assists and two steals to his scoring total. Joffrey Lauvergne matched Westbrook's scoring total while leading the bench and added six rebounds and four assists. Cameron Payne provided 12 points, three boards, two assists and two steals as a reserve. Steven Adams posted nine points and hauled in 11 rebounds, while also recording one block and one steal. Domantas Sabonis tallied six points, seven rebounds, one assist and one block. Jerian Grant and Alex Abrines posted matching eight-point efforts off the bench as well.

Markieff Morris paced Washington with 23 points, six rebounds, one assist and two steals. Bradley Beal posted 22 points and three assists. Otto Porter, Jr. managed an 18-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included two blocks.

Marcin Gortat totaled 12 points, five rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Trey Burke led the bench with 11 points, four rebounds and four assists.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Detroit Pistons, 102-89, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Monday.

Despite this game being close throughout the first quarter, the Bucks took care of business in dominating fashion. The second quarter was the decisive stretch, with Milwaukee winning that quarter, 28-15. Shooting was the key, as the Bucks shot 51 percent, while holding the Pistons to just 44 percent. The assist-to-turnover differential was decisive as well, with Milwaukee recording 26 assists to 11 turnovers, while Detroit matched their assists and turnovers at 17 a piece. The Bucks also went a perfect 16-of-16 from the free-throw line in their win.

The Pistons (26-30) were coming off a huge comeback win over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday, but this blowout loss makes that road win look much less valuable. Andre Drummond was Detroit's best player, as he collected 21 points, 12 rebounds and three steals. Marcus Morris led the team in scoring, as he tallied 26 points, five rebounds and three assists on 10-of-17 shooting. Jon Leuer recorded a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double, while going 6-of-9 from the field. On deck for Detroit is a home matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday.

The Bucks (24-30) have now won two-straight, as they hope this is the start of a big run. Greg Monroe abused his former team, as he led Milwaukee with 25 points, 13 rebounds and three steals on 12-of-15 shooting off the bench. Michael Beasley led the starters, as he accrued 23 points, three rebounds, four assists, and three steals on 10-of-13 from the field. Tony Snell finished third on the team with 16 points and two rebounds. Milwaukee will look to keep rolling on Wednesday in a road matchup with the Brooklyn Nets,											",Milwaukee,Bucks,Detroit,Pistons,Fiserv Forum,26,30,24,30,6.0,21.0,40.0,79.0,16.0,16.0,33.0,26.0,11.0,7.0,21.0,34.0,78.0,14.0,19.0,44.0,17.0,17.0,Giannis Antetokounmpo,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,36,Marcus Morris Sr.,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,10.0,17.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,39,Michael Beasley,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,23.0,10.0,13.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31,Jon Leuer,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,36,Thon Maker,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,10.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,16,Andre Drummond,12.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,21.0,8.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,34,Tony Snell,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,11.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,29,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,32,Matthew Dellavedova,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,27,Reggie Jackson,2.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,31,Malcolm Brogdon,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20,Tobias Harris,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,11.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,19,Greg Monroe,13.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,25.0,12.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Ish Smith,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,Mirza Teletovic,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,9,Aron Baynes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Khris Middleton,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,17,Stanley Johnson,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,15,Jason Terry,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,16,Boban Marjanovic,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks 111-98 Monday at American Airlines Center.

The Celtics (36-19) held a comfortable 11-points lead headed into halftime and looked to be well on their way to their third straight victory. However, a run in the third quarter from the Mavericks (22-32) brought them to within one and made it a game. But that competitiveness lasted just 12 minutes, as Boston turned it back on in the final period, especially on defense, as they held Dallas to just 16 points. Isaiah Thomas led the way in the end for the Celtics, scoring a game-high 29 points and dishing out eight assists in 34 minutes. But the most important performance of the night came from starting shooting guard Marcus Smart, as he continues to play some of the best basketball of his young career. He finished with 19 points on on 6-of-11 shooting, three rebounds, three assists and two steals in 35 minutes. Boston has now won nine of their last 10 games. 

As for the Mavericks (22-33), the loss ends a brief two-game winning streak for the team. In the loss, however, they received another hot shooting performance from Yogi Ferrell, who has officially played his way into being a regular in Dallas' rotation, even with the presence of starter Deron Williams. Ferrell finished with 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field and five assists in 32 minutes off the bench. Ferrell's shooting stroke wasn't particularly contagious, however, as the team managed to shoot just 45.5 percent from the field in the end. On top of that, the five reserves other than Ferrell that saw the court Monday combine for just 11 points in the losing effort.

Up next, the Celtics will return home Wednesday to take on the 76ers, while the Mavericks will head to Detroit on Wednesday to take on the Pistons.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Golden State Warriors 132-110 Monday at Pepsi Center.

The Warriors (46-9) entered Wednesday's contest without Klay Thompson (heel), and the Nuggets (25-30) elected to take full advantage. The result was the game essentially being over by halftime, with Denver holding a convincing 25-point advantage after the first 24 minutes of the game. In the second half, the Nuggets refused to let up, as they continued to be carried by their rising star Nikola Jokic. Jokic recorded a triple-double of 17 points, 21 rebounds and 12 assists in 36 minutes. But it didn't stop there for Denver, as three starters managed to score at least 20 points Monday night, with Juan Hernangomez scoring a game-high 27 points to go along with 10 rebounds, Will Barton scoring 24 points and Jameer Nelson adding 23 of his own. As a team, the Nuggets were simply unstoppable from behind the arc, shooting 60 percent from long range. 

As for Golden State, it was simply not their night in the high altitude at the Pepsi Center. Kevin Durant was remarkably efficient, scoring 25 points in 27 minutes, but it wasn't nearly enough to tame the high-powered Denver offense. Steph Curry really struggled, putting together one of his worst performances of the season and finishing with just 11 points on a brutal 4-of-18 shooting from the field. As a team, the Warriors managed to shoot just 8-of-32 from behind the arc, with the starting five hitting just five of their 23 3-point attempts.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers took down the Utah Jazz on Monday, 88-72.

Los Angeles (34-21) passed Utah in the standings with the win, claiming fourth place in the Western Conference.  Superstar Chris Paul remains sidelined with a thumb injury, but LA has managed to win three straight in his absence.  One of the keys to the Clippers' success has been the strong play of star forward Blake Griffin.  Griffin led the team with 26 points on Monday, also notching 10 rebounds and six assists.  Griffin was the key to the Clippers' offense in what was a slow-paced and defense-dominated game.  LA was able to shoot 44 percent from the field, far ahead of the dismal 33 percent managed by Utah.

Utah (34-22) is trending in the opposite direction of LA, as the team has now lost three contests in a row.  Monday was a particularly poor showing for the Jazz, as the team saw its lowest offensive output of the season.  Only three team members scored in double figures and the high scorer was forward Derrick Favors with just 13.  All-Star Gordon Hayward, meanwhile, fell completely flat, scoring only seven points on 2-of-12 shooting.  The Jazz had plenty of second chances on Monday, as center Rudy Gobert came down with eight offensive rebounds.  Nevertheless, the team still struggled to find the basket.  

The Clippers will host the Hawks on Wednesday, while the Jazz will host the Trail Blazers.

												The visiting New Orleans Pelicans narrowly defeated the Phoenix Suns on Monday, 110-108. 

New Orleans (22-34) was led to the win by strong play from superstar Anthony Davis.  Davis led the team with 24 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks and played a whopping 40 minutes.  Per usual, the 23-year-old superstar did everything on the court, including going a perfect 8-of-8 from the line.  Free-throw shooting was a major edge for the Pelicans, as they reached the line 35 times and shot 80 percent.  It took an edge at the line and holding Phoenix to just 43 percent shooting to squeeze out the win, as the Suns managed to come away with an impressive 13 offensive rebounds for second chances.  

Phoenix (17-39) also saw an extremely strong game from point guard Eric Bledsoe.  Bledsoe scored a team-high 37 points and came away with three steals.  Bledsoe, who had his season shortened by a torn meniscus in 2015-16, has been enjoying the best year of his career thus far.  The 37-point explosion nears his career high of 42 set earlier in the season.  Sophomore Devin Booker continued his scoring tear as well.  Booker hit two three-pointers and scored 21 points on the night.  In the end, though, the Suns made too many costly turnovers.  Phoenix turned it over 18 times on the night.  

The Pelicans will visit the Grizzlies on Wednesday while the Suns host the Lakers.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center on Monday. 

Paul MIllsap was the hero for Atlanta, as he drained a floating layup with 0:01 remaining in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime, and then assisted Kent Bazemore on game winning jumper in the extra time. Millsap went on to put the game out of reach the free throw line and secure the road victory for Atlanta (32-23). 

The Blazers (23-32) dropped to 14-13 on their home court, but were hanging tough with the Hawks throughout the contest. Damian Lillard was flexing his range from way beyond 24-feet, while C.J. McCollum was clutch with needed baskets down the stretch. The duo combined for 47 points, but it took 45 shots, and outside of the strong shooting in the fourth quarter, Lillard ended up going 6-of-21 from the field. 

Millsap was far from efficient in his effort as well, but his play when it mattered most shined through on his way to 21 points, nine rebound, five assists, two steals and four blocks on 4-of-12 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. punched in 25 points across 43 minutes, and has really been phenomenal in his starts for Thabo Sefolosha. Hardaway added seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. Dwight Howard was monsterous on the boards, and ended up with 19 points and 16 rebounds. 

Next up, the Hawks will visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, while the Blazers play the same night on the road at the Utah Jazz.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Chicago Bulls, 117-89, at Target Center on Sunday afternoon.

The Bulls (26-29) came in to Sunday's contest at a significant disadvantage, considering that Jimmy Butler (heel), Dwyane Wade (wrists), Nikola Mirotic (back) and Paul Zipser (ankle) were all out of commission. That left Chicago with a tight rotation of 10 players, not to mention a major offensive void. The handicap spelled disaster against a Timberwolves (21-34) squad at full strength that ambushed their visitors out of the gate by a 34-17 first-quarter margin. Although the Bulls battled back in the second period, the cushion afforded by that lead was enough to carry the hosts the rest of the way. Chicago also committed 18 turnovers, further hampering their chances at keeping matters competitive.

The rather unlikely duo of Doug McDermott and Bobby Portis led the way for the Bulls with matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding two assists and one rebound and the latter also supplying six boards. Michael Carter-Williams pitched in with 12 points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. Robin Lopez provided 10 points, four rebounds, two assists and one block, while Rajon Rondo matched Lopez's scoring total and added six assists, three rebounds and one steal in 24 minutes off the bench. Jerian Grant totaled eight points, three assists, a rebound and a block, and Taj Gibson, the only other member besides Carter-Williams and Lopez to take the court, tallied two points, five rebounds and one assist. 

Andrew Wiggins paced the Timberwolves with 27 points, six boards, four assists, two steals and one block. Karl-Anthony Towns followed with 22 points, seven boards, four assists and one steal. Ricky Rubio turned in a 17-point, 11-assist double-double that also included six rebounds and two steals. Nemanja Bjelica led the bench with 16 points, six rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block in 19 highly efficient minutes. Shabazz Muhammad was productive as a reserve as well with 12 points, two rebounds and one steal. Gorgui Dieng posted a 10-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included two steals and one block. 

The Bulls return home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday evening, while the Timberwolves remain home to do battle with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night as well.

												The New York Knicks defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 94-90, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.

The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Spurs win, but the Knicks had other ideas. This game was close throughout, as there were nine ties and six lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 12 points. Shooting was the difference, with New York hitting 50 percent of their shots, while San Antonio couldn't crack 37 percent. Three-point shooting was a big part of that, with the Spurs going just 6-of-29 and the Knicks hitting 9-of-14 from long distance. 

The Spurs (41-13) have been susceptible to duds like this, as they simply didn't have enough help for Kawhi Leonard in this game. Leonard scored a game-high 36 points to add to his nine rebounds, four assists and four steals. LaMarcus Aldridge was the only other starter in double figures, as he totaled 15 points and 10 rebounds. David Lee led the bench with 10 points and seven rebounds. San Antonio will be in action again on Monday in a road matchup against the Indiana Pacers. 

The Knicks (24-33) have been one of the most dysfunctional teams over recent weeks, but wins like this will surely quiet the skeptics for the time being. Carmelo Anthony led the team in scoring, as he tallied 25 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Derrick Rose was second on the team, accruing 18 points, four rebounds and two assists. Kristaps Porzingis shot just 4-of-10 from the field, but still collected 16 points, seven rebounds and four blocks. Willy Hernangomez got the start at center and amassed 12 points, nine rebounds and three steals. New York will be off until Wednesday, when they play the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road for their next fixture.

												The visiting Detroit Pistons earned a somewhat miraculous win over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday, 102-101.

Detroit (26-29) has shown signs of picking up, as the team is now 5-2 in its last seven games.  The Pistons are sitting at eighth in the Eastern Conference and are hoping to earn another playoff berth after a first-round exit in 2016.  On Sunday, the team saw stellar play from top to bottom, as the bench produced three double-digit scorers.  One of those three players was Tobias Harris, who led the team with 24 points on impressive 9-of-13 shooting.  Center Andre Drummond, meanwhile, attacked the glass effectively all night, pulling down a whopping 18 rebounds.  Despite shooting just 42 percent, Detroit was able to earn the win thanks to second chances from a stellar 11 offensive rebounds.  

Toronto (32-23) has been ice cold of late.  After comfortably holding the second seed in the East for the early part of the season, the Raptors are now only half of a game ahead of fifth place.  The team is 4-7 in its last 11 games.  For Toronto, Sunday's loss came in brutal fashion, as the first three quarters looked like a much-needed blowout.  Toronto shot a stellar 50 percent from the field and from beyond the arc, but could not contain Andre Drummond and the Pistons on the offensive glass.  All-Star starter DeMar DeRozan led the team with 26 points but failed to convert in crunch time, as he was unable to draw the foul he was looking for on the Raptors' final possession.  

The Pistons will visit Milwaukee on Tuesday, while the Raptors will see Chicago on Wednesday.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 105-99 at Golden 1 Center on Sunday. 

The Kings (23-32) came away with their 13th home victory of the season after a rather sloppy performance from the Pelicans (21-34). Buddy Heild was ejected early on after a below the belt foul to Kings center DeMarcus Cousins, and Anthony Davis' 32 points were not enough to help get the road win. Langston Galloway buried a three pointer for New Orleans with 4:18 remaining in the fourth quarter to bring the game within four points, but Cousins answered immediately with a driving dunk. From then on, Sacramento was able to stave off any comeback and put away the contest. 

Cousins finished with 28 points, 14 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and one block on 7-of-14 shooting. Darren Collison pitched in on the scoring effort with 20 points, to go with eight assists and six rebounds, while Matt Barnes led the bench with 12 points. Davis was effective across his 40 minutes of work, putting forth 32 points, 10 rebounds and three assists, while New Orleans got little help from other scorers. Jrue Holiday added 14 points on 14 shots, and the Pelicans shot just 41.5 percent from the field. 

Next up, the Pelicans visit the Phoenix Suns on Monday, while the Kings visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Charlotte Hornets, 107-102, at Spectrum Center on Saturday evening. 

The Clippers led by two at half time and boosted that lead, as they took a seven-point advantage into the fourth. The Hornets gave it a push in the fourth but were not able to make up the full difference. 

Jamal Crawford was the high-point man for the Clippers (33-21), as he led the way with 22 points on 6-of-11 shooting, in 27 minutes off the bench. Blake Griffin filled the stat sheet with 20 points, 12 rebounds, eight assists and one block, in 35 minutes, while Austin Rivers chipped in 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting, including 4-of-6 from downtown. The Clippers won the rebounding battle and outscored the Hornets by 14 in the paint. The Clippers will look for their third straight win, as they go on to visit Utah to take on the Jazz on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the Hornets (24-30) struggled from the field, shooting only 43.0 percent. Kemba Walker was the main contributor to Charlotte's poor shooting percentage, as he went 4-of-18 from the field, including 1-of-9 from long range, on his way to only 10 points. Nicolas Batum was the high-point man for the Hornets, with 25, to go along with eight assists, six rebounds and one block, in 37 minutes. Frank Kaminsky came up big, as he got the start in place of the injured Cody Zeller. Kaminsky finished with 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal, in 36 minutes. The Hornets will look to snap a two-game losing streak, as they go on to host the 76ers on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Indiana Pacers, 116-100, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday evening. 

The Bucks hit a season-high 17 three-pointers, on 17-of-31 shooting from long range, as they handed the Pacers their third straight loss. Both teams shot exactly the same, 35-of-73, 47.9 percent from the field, but the Bucks hit seven more threes, to gain the edge.

The Bucks (23-30) dished 28 assists, as everyone got involved in the efforts to make up for the lack of Jabari Parker in the line up. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with 20 points, 10 assists, eight rebounds, two blocks and one steal, in 34 minutes. Mirza Teletovic came up huge with 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting, including 5-of-9 from long range, in only 17 minutes off the bench. Greg Monroe and Malcolm Brogdon each chipped in 17 points off the bench, to contribute to a total of 55 bench points for Milwaukee. The Bucks will look to build on this win, as they look ahead to Monday, when they will play host to the Pistons. 

The Pacers (29-25) saw their top three players really struggle from the field, as Paul George, Jeff Teague and Myles Turner combined to shoot 9-of-25. Jeff Teague only attempted two shots, while George and Turner attempted 11 and 12 respectively, hitting four each. Monta Ellis came up with 18 points off the bench, while C.J. Miles led the way for Indiana, with 23 points on 8-of-16 shooting, including 6-of-11 from long range. The Pacers still have a grip on sixth place in the East but need to get back on track as soon as possible, in order to maintain that spot. They will look to get back on track, as they go on to play host to the Spurs on Monday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the visiting Miami Heat, 117-109, at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday evening.

The Heat saw their historic 13-game win streak come to an end, as the Sixers, another team from the lower half of the Eastern Conference that has impressed this season, took them down with good team basketball. The Sixers tallied 27 assists and only gave up 10 turnovers, while forcing 20 out of the Heat, to help gain the edge. 

The Sixers (20-34) hit 30-of-38 from the free throw line and shot 45.3 percent from the field. Seven players scored in double digits for Philadelphia, including all five starters. Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington and Dario Saric each finished with a team-high 19 points, while Ersan Ilyasova and Gerald Henderson added 14 points each. This marks the 76ers' second straight win, and they will look to keep things rolling, as they go on to visit Charlotte on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the Heat (24-31) were led by Goran Dragic, who poured in 30 points to go along with five rebounds, two assists and two steals, in 37 minutes. James Johnson followed up with 26 points on 8-of-15 shooting, in 36 minutes off the bench, while Tyler Johnson chipped in 17 off the bench. Hassan Whiteside gobbled up 19 rebounds but was relatively quite in the points column, as he finished with 12 on 5-of-11 shooting. The Heat fell apart as they gave up 20 turnovers, including a few of them during crunch time. The Heat will look to bounce back, as they go on to play host to the Magic on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Denver Nuggets, 125-109, at Quicken Loans Arena on Saturday. 

The Cavaliers (37-16) have had their share of struggles in recent weeks, but have maintained their stellar home record. Cleveland checked in to Saturday with 22 victories in 27 tilts at Quicken Loans Arena, and with an injury-hampered Nuggets (24-30) squad on tap, they went into the game as heavy favorites. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving insured that they didn't squander the opportunity, leading the way with matching 27-point efforts. The Cavs were excellent on both ends of the floor, posting success rates of 54.8 percent from the field and 50.0 percent from three-point range, while limiting Denver to respective tallies of 40.2 and 34.2 in those categories.

Gary Harris was next with 16 points, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Jamal Murray matched Harris' scoring total while leading the second unit, and he added an assist and a steal. Wilson Chandler drew another start for Danilo Gallinari (groin) and provided 13 points, six boards and an assist. Jameer Nelson filled out the stat sheet with 12 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Will Barton was productive as a reserve as well with 12 points, four assists, three rebounds and one steal.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 130-114, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday night.

In a game laden with star power, all eyes were on Kevin Durant in his first game in Oklahoma City after having headed west this past summer in free agency. Durant came through in spectacular fashion in the emotional contest, posting 34 points, nine rebounds and three assists. His stellar performance spearheaded the Warriors' 52.9-percent shooting night and paved the way to the blowout victory. Golden State (46-8) gained separation with a 43-point second quarter, and the Thunder (31-24) committed 19 turnovers overall -- 11 on the part of Russell Westbrook -- undermining their chances against the best team in the NBA. 

Durant added nine rebounds and three assists to his team-high scoring total. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson checked in behind Durant with a pair of 26-point efforts, with the former adding nine assists, eight rebounds and two steals, and the latter providing a rebound and a steal. JaVale McGee was highly efficient with 16 points and three rebounds over 20 minutes. Andre Iguodala led the bench with eight points, five rebounds and three assists.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 133-102, at Toyota Center on Saturday evening. 

The Suns (17-38) have been one of the most porous defenses in the NBA throughout the entire season, while the Rockets (40-17), as customary, have been one of the most prolific scoring squads. Both of those patterns held true Saturday, as Houston compiled a whopping 77 points in the first half on their way to a blowout home win. James Harden led all scorers with 40 points, which he supplemented with eight assists and six rebounds. With Eric Bledsoe sitting out for rest, Phoenix couldn't come close to keeping pace, and shot just 39.4 percent overall, which largely negated the 21 turnovers they elicited from the Rockets. 

Devin Booker led the way for the visitors with 18 points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. T.J. Warren followed with 14 points, five boards and three steals. Alex Len drew the start and managed 13 points, eight rebounds, two assists and one block. The second unit featured a trio of double-digit scoring efforts led by Tyler Ulis, who posted 13 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Jared Dudley and Leandro Barbosa followed with matching 12-point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block, and the latter hauling in three boards. Marquese Chriss chipped in with seven points, six rebounds and three assists.

Patrick Beverley was a distant second behind Harden with 19 points, 10 boards, five assists and two steals. Ryan Anderson generated 16 points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Sam Dekker was next with a bench-leading 14 points that he supplemented with four rebounds, one assist and one block. Trevor Ariza and Clint Capela provided a pair of nine-point tallies, with the former also collecting nine rebounds, two assists and three steals, and the latter hauling in five boards, dishing out a pair of dimes and recording a block.

The Suns head back home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday evening, while the Rockets welcome the Miami Heat on Wednesday night.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Orlando Magic, 112-80, at American Airlines Center on Saturday. 

Despite Orlando leading for the majority of the first quarter, this was one of the most dominating wins for Dallas all year. The second quarter was the difference in the game, with the Mavericks outscoring the Magic, 32-12. From there, it never got within 20 points with most starters sitting out the fourth quarter. Defense was key for Dallas, as they held Orlando to 39 percent from the field (32-of-82) and 13 percent from three-point range (3-of-2). The assist differential was huge as well, with the Mavericks doubling up the Magic, 32-16. Dallas also dominated the rebounding, outrebounding Orlando, 51-40.

The Magic (20-36) have now lost 18 of their last 23 games and this blowout loss may be rock-bottom. Evan Fournier was the lone starter with more than 10 pointss, as he collected 14 points, twp rebounds and one assist. Bismack Biyombo was solid off the bench, producing 15 points, seven rebounds, one steal and one block. Nikola Vucevic went just 1-of-5 from the field to score three points, but led the team with 10 rebounds. On deck for Orlando is a road matchup with a scorching-hot Miami Heat team on Monday. 

The Mavericks (22-32) have been a different team over recent weeks and blowout wins like this show just how good they can be. Wesley Matthews led the team in scoring, as he tallied 20 points, four rebounds and six assists, while going 6-of-8 from three-point range. Seth Curry tied for second on the team, finishing with 14 points, three rebounds and four assists. Deron Williams played for the first time in weeks after returning from a toe injury to provide seven points, four assists and three steals. Salah Mejri was a huge spark off the bench, totaling four points, 15 rebounds and two blocks. Yogi Ferrell also played well off the bench, accumulating 10 points, three rebounds and seven assists. Dallas will host the Boston Celtics on Monday for their next game.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Utah Jazz, 112-104, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday.

Utah are typically one of the toughest defenses in the NBA, but Boston went through them like a hot knife through butter in the first half. In fact, the Celtics went 24-of-36 from the field to lead by 14 points at the half, as it never got within six points from there. It was a wire-to-wire win for Boston, as Utah couldn't climb back into the game. The shooting was just as lopsided for the whole game, with the Celtics shooting 59 percent and Utah hitting just 41 percent of their shots. The assist-to-turnover differential was decisive as well, with the Celtics recording four more assists than the Jazz and committing nine less turnovers.

The Celtics (35-19) have been one of the best teams in the NBA over recent weeks and a road win in Utah just adds to their impressive resume'. Isaiah Thomas once again carried the load, as he led the team with 29 points and five assists on 9-of-16 from the field. Al Horford was second among starters, finishing with 16 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Gerald Green and Kelly Olynyk were huge off the bench, as Green scored 16 points on 7-of-8 shooting and Olynyk provided 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks on 8-of-11 from the field. 

The Jazz (34-21) haven't had many dud performances this season, as they simply didn't have it against this hot Celtics team. Gordon Hayward was Utah's best player, as he led the team with 31 points and four assists. George Hill was second on the team, totaling 22 points, four assists and three steals. Rudy Gobert recorded a double-double, amassing 14 points and 14 rebounds.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 108-99, at Barclays Center on Friday.

The two teams came into Friday's contest as polar opposites, with the Heat (24-30) looking to tally their 13th consecutive victory and the Nets (9-45) trying to avoid a 12th straight defeat. Brooklyn's one ray of hope was the fact that they'd notched seven of their nine wins on the season at home, and perhaps the more intangible factor of the odds eventually favoring a Miami loss and Brooklyn victory, given their respective extended streaks. However, as usual, the Nets couldn't hang on to the ball with any degree of consistency, significantly undermining their chances. The home team committed 22 turnovers overall, while also getting outscored 59-46 in the second half.

The Heat bench compiled 56 points overall, with James Johnson scoring a team-high 26, and adding eight rebounds, two assists, three blocks and a steal. Goran Dragic was next with 21 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. Tyler Johnson totaled 18 points, six rebounds, two assists and three steals. Rodney McGruder chipped in with 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and four steals. Okaro White supplied 10 points, five boards and one assist in 31 minutes as a reserve. Wayne Ellington drew the start for Dion Waiters (ankle) and went for nine points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal, and Hassan Whiteside had a quiet game despite the appealing matchup, posting eight points, nine boards, one steal and four blocks. 

Brook Lopez's 30 points led Brooklyn, a total he supplemented with eight rebounds, one assist and two blocks. Randy Foye tallied 15 points, one rebound and two assists. Bojan Bogdanovic was the third and final member of the Nets with double-digit scoring, collecting 10 points and six rebounds. Caris LeVert submitted a bench-leading nine points along with three rebounds and one assist. Trevor Booker was productive as a reserve as well, managing eight points, hauling in 10 boards and dishing out one assist.

The Heat next head to Philadelphia to tangle with the Sixers on Saturday night, while the Nets remain home to face off with the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host New York Knicks, 131-123, at Madison Square Garden on Friday. 

Defense has been optional for these teams all season and the 254 combined points in this game show just where their priorities are. Denver really took control in the third quarter, outscoring New York, 36-22, and never relinquishing the lead from there. Both offenses were scoring at ease, with both teams shooting over 55 percent from the field. The Nuggets feasted down low, as they won the rebounding differential, 44-33, and outscored the Knicks, 68-52, in the paint. 

The Nuggets (24-29) have been one of the best offenses in the league this season and this 131-point outing shows just how efficient they can be. Nikola Jokic was the player of the game, as he dropped a career-high 40 points on 17-of-23 shooting, adding nine rebounds, five assists and two rebounds to his tally. Wilson Chandler finished second on the team, collecting 19 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Jameer Nelson started for Emmanuel Mudiay and accrued 16 points, four rebounds and 12 assists. Will Barton was the only bench player in double figures, as he totaled 15 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. 

The Knicks (22-33) have had a ton of drama surrounding their team and losses like this show just why. Carmelo Anthony did all he could to carry New York, as he accumulated 33 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals on 13-of-20 from the field. Kristaps Porzingis was second on the team, finishing with 17 points, four rebounds and two assists. Brandon Jennings got a rare start and led the team with 13 assists, despite going just 2-of-10 from the field. Kyle O'Quinn led the bench, providing 16 points, six rebounds, three assists and four blocks.

The Pistons came up with a strong second half, outscoring the Spurs 51-43, however it was not enough to make up for their early struggles, as the Spurs walked away with their fifth win in six games. 

Kawhi Leonard led the way for San Antonio (41-12) with a game-high 32 points on 11-of-22 shooting, to go along with six rebounds and five assists, in 33 minutes.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 122-114, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening. 

The Lakers (19-37) checked in to Friday's contest with only six road victories in 30 games away from Staples Center this season, so their chances of victory weren't exactly abundant against a Bucks (22-30) squad that had broken even at home over 26 contests. However, a 47-point first quarter got the visitors off to a roaring start, and they maintained the hot hand from the field throughout. Los Angeles tallied success rates of 52.0 percent from the floor and 50.0 percent from three-point range, while their bench chipped in with a collective 58 points. The Bucks put forth a late surge that saw them post 30 points in the final period, but clutch free throws from Nick Young, D'Angelo Russell and Larry Nance, Jr. helped the Lakers hang on for the upside road win.

Young led the way with 26 points, which he supplemented with four assists, two rebounds and two steals. Lou Williams paced the bench with 21 points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. Julius Randle was next with 15 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal. Russell provided 14 points, five assists, three boards and one steal. Ivica Zubac was productive as a reserve as well with 15 points, six rebounds, two assists and a block. Nance and Jordan Clarkson turned in matching 11-point efforts off the bench, with the former adding five rebounds, three assists and one steal, while the latter dished out four dimes and recorded a steal. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only Bucks starter to manage double-digit scoring, but he amassed enough points for at least two players. The Greek Freak went for 41 points, eight rebounds, six assists, three blocks and two steals. Malcolm Brogdon led the bench with 18 points, three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Michael Beasley turned in 15 points, five boards, two assists and one block. Thon Maker got first crack at the starting power forward job with Jabari Parker (knee) out for the season and turned in seven points, six rebounds and one assist.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies, 122-107, at FedEx Forum on Friday.

Memphis had beat Golden State in their two previous meetings this season, but it was clear the Warriors were having none of that here. It was a wire-to-wire win for Golden State, as they held a double-digit lead for the final 20-plus minutes. Defense was key for the Warriors, with Memphis being held to 39 percent shooting and committing 18 turnovers. That's especially evident through the blocks and steals, with Golden State recording 27 combined blocks and steals to the Grizzlies 10. Golden State were efficient on their end, as they shot 51 percent from the field and recorded 31 assists to just 12 turnovers. 

The Warriors (45-8) were clearly not happy with the first two losses against the Grizzlies, as they took it to them in this effort-filled performance. Draymond Green was the player of the game, despite scoring just four points, as he provided 12 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals and five blocks in an all-around gem. Klay Thompson led the team in scoring, as he dropped 36 points on 8-of-15 from three-point range. Steph Curry finished with 18 points, four rebounds and five assists. Kevin Durant accumulated 24 points, five rebounds and four assists. Andre Iguodala was a nice spark off the bench, amassing 22 points and four assists on 6-of-7 from the field. 

The Grizzlies (33-23) had a tough task here against a hungry Warriors team and they simply didn't have enough to compete in this game. Mike Conley carried the load, as he collected 20 points, five rebounds and nine assists. Marc Gasol shot just 4-of-14 from the field, but still totaled 17 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Zach Randolph was a bright spot off the bench, contributing 17 points and 13 rebounds.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves, 122-106, at Target Center on Friday evening. 

The Timberwolves looked great after the first quarter, leading 40-28 after 12 minutes of action. However, they fell apart in the next three quarters, where they were outscored 94-66. 

The Pelicans (21-33) shot 60.0 percent from the field and 48 percent from long range, while they dished 27 assists. Anthony Davis led the way with a game-high 42 points on 16-of-22 shooting, to go along with 13 rebounds, in 36 minutes. Jrue Holiday also came up big, as he tallied 25 points, to go along with 12 assists, six rebounds and five steals, in 38 minutes. Buddy Hield chipped in 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting, while Dante Cunningham added 12 points. The Pelicans will look to keep rolling, as they visit Sacramento on Sunday to take on the Kings. 

Meanwhile, the Timberwolves shot 46.3 percent from the field, while they struggled going 6-of-27 from long range. Karl-Anthony Towns finished with a team-high 36 points, while Andrew Wiggins followed up with 29 points. Ricky Rubio finished with 15 points, 12 rebounds and nabbed four steals, in 39 minutes. The Timberwolves' bench only chipped in nine points in the contest, despite having the newly acquired and energetic Lance Stephenson as a part of the troop. The Timberwolves will look to bounce back as they play host to the Bulls on Sunday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Indiana Pacers, 112-107, at Verizon Center on Friday.

Despite there being just five ties and six lead changes, this game was close throughout. In fact, neither team grabbed a double-digit lead, as it came down to the final seconds. Three-point shooting was the difference in the game, with the Wizards going 10-of-29 and the Pacers hitting just 4-of-21 from long distance. Washington also dominated the steal differential, winning that battle, 8-3. 

The Pacers (29-24) had a tough task here against one of the best home teams in the league and they fell just shy in this close loss. Paul George carried the load, as he tallied 31 points, four rebounds and two steals. Jeff Teague was second among starters, as he totaled 13 points, four rebounds and nine assists. Kevin Seraphin was second on the team, as he provided 16 points and seven rebounds off the bench. The Pacers will host the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday for their next game. 

The Wizards (32-21) have been dominant at home this season, as this marks their 18th win in 19 games at home. Markieff Morris was the star, as he dropped a season-high 26 points to add to his 10 rebounds and three assists.  John Wall matched those 26 points, as he also contributed three rebounds and 14 assists. Bradley Beal accumulated 20 points, three rebounds and four assists. Marcin Gortat collected 14 points and 16 rebounds en route to a double-double. On deck for Washington is a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.

												The host Sacramento Kings stunned the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, coming back from down 22 to win, 108-107.

Sacramento (22-32) had not led until the game's final minute, when the team finally pulled ahead by a single point.  A back-and-forth battle in the final minutes culminated in a game-winner for Kings point guard Darren Collison.  Collison, who was integral to Sacramento's home win against Boston on Thursday, scored 22 points and also dished out four assists.  Young shooting guard Ben McLemore was another key piece of the win, as his 22 points helped spark Sacramento's comeback.  Ultimately, however, it was the play of recently-suspended superstar DeMarcus Cousins that put the team over the top.  Cousins wowed with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists on the night.  Sacramento's two big wins this week over tough opponents have helped them stay in the mix for the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoff race.

Atlanta (31-23) is one of many Eastern Conference teams grappling for position in the tight playoff standings.  Friday's blown lead, however, did not help the team's case.  While the Hawks saw solid offense coming from multiple starters, a shoddy second-half effort cost the team the game.  The team shot over 50 percent on the night and had three 20-point scorers, but allowed a barrage of three-pointers to fuel a comeback for Sacramento.  The Kings finished with 18 threes made on the night.  

The Hawks will visit Portland on Monday, while the Kings will host the Pelicans on Sunday.

												The host Phoenix Suns destroyed the Chicago Bulls on Friday, 115-97.

The Suns (17-37) snapped a three-game losing streak by torching Chicago on Friday.  Phoenix has enjoyed the continuing growth of sophomore shooting guard Devin Booker, who led the team with 27 points and shouldered a large part of the offensive load.  His backcourt partner Eric Bledsoe, meanwhile, scored 23 points and dished a team-high eight assists. It was an effective offensive night for the entire team, as the Suns shot over 50 percent from the field and hit eight three-pointers. Phoenix also saw promising play off the bench from young big man Alan Williams, who had a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double.

The Bulls (26-28) continued to be the league's most unpredictable team on Friday, following a rocky set of games by being decimated at the hands of the Suns.  Superstar Jimmy Butler did his fair share for the team, scoring 20 points and dishing out six assists.  However, it was a dull night on offense for the rest of the team.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 107-95, at Spectrum Center on Thursday evening. 

James Harden had exploded for a 40-point, 15-rebound, 10-assist triple-double in his previous encounter with the Hornets (24-29), so it was little surprise that his contributions spearheaded Houston's 19th road win of the season Thursday. The perennial All-Star tallied a game-high 30 points that he supplemented with 11 boards, eight assists, one steal and one block. The rest of the starting five also posted double digits in the scoring column, and although they committed 17 turnovers, the Rockets (39-17) countered their mistakes by eliciting 21 from Charlotte. 

Patrick Beverley followed Harden with 17 points, three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Ryan Anderson was next with 14 points, four rebounds and one assist. Trevor Ariza and Clint Capela rounded out the first unit's productive night with matching 11-point efforts, with the former adding seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks, and the latter supplying seven boards, two assists, three steals and a block. Montrezl Harrell paced the second unit with 15 points, four rebounds, one assist and a steal. 

Nicolas Batum's 15-point, 10-assist double-double that also included eight rebounds and one steal paced the Hornets. Kemba Walker managed 14 points, five rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. Marvin Williams tallied 12 points, seven boards and two steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had a modest but full stat line with eight points, nine rebounds, four assists, two blocks and one steal. Cody Zeller returned from a seven-game absence with a quad injury and generated nine points, four rebounds, one assist and two steals over 22 minutes before exiting with soreness. Marco Belinelli led the bench with 10 points, four boards and one assist. Frank Kaminsky (nine points) and Jeremy Lamb (eight points) were productive with the second unit as well.

The Rockets return home to face off with the Phoenix Suns on Saturday evening, while the Hornets remain home to tangle with the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday afternoon.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Orlando Magic, 112-111, Thursday at Amway Center.

With two minutes remaining and the 76ers (19-34) down six points, the game was in serious doubt for Philadelphia. But, over the course of the next minute and a half, the 76ers hit five free throws before a Dario Saric layup put the team up by one point with just 35 seconds remaining. A short shot from Orlando's Nikola Vucevic put them back up two, but then T.J. McConnell ended up being the hero once again, hitting his second game-winning shot of the season as the 76ers ultimately walked away with the victory. Saric stepped up in a big way for Philadelphia on Thursday, scoring a game-high 24 points and grabbing eight rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench, while the hero McConnell did well getting his teammates involved, dishing out eight assists to go along with eight points and five rebounds, as the Sixers managed to end a five-game losing streak with the win. 

As for the Magic (20-35), Vucevic recorded yet another double-double, posting 21 points on 10-of-13 shooting and 11 rebounds in 31 minutes. Evan Fournier came close to a triple-double, scoring a team-high 24 points to go along with nine rebounds and eight assists. Fournier shot 3-of-6 from behind the arc, and his team for the most part followed, shooting 47.6 percent from long range. Where the game was ultimately lost, however, was the Magic's inability to take care of the basketball, as they recorded 21 total turnovers as a team.

Up next, the 76ers will look to keep up their winning ways Saturday against the Heat, while the Magic will look to end their three-game losing streak Saturday against the Mavericks.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 118-109, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Thursday. 

Despite there being just nine ties and seven lead changes in this game, it was close throughout. In fact, neither team led by more than 12 points, as the nine-point final margin was one of the largest leads of the game. Oklahoma City won this game, despite being out shot from the field, from three-point range and from the free-throw line. Rebounding was the decisive statistic, with the Thunder winning that battle, 51-35. They also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording 10 more assists and committing three less turnovers. 

The Cavaliers (36-16) were expected to rest their starters for this game, but they ended up playing in this tough loss. Kyrie Irving led the team, as he tallied 28 points and four assists on 11-of-18 shooting. LeBron James finished second on the team with 18 points, five rebounds, seven assists, two steals and two blocks. Kevin Love recorded a double-double, totaling 15 points, 12 rebounds and three steals. The Cavaliers host the Denver Nuggets on Saturday for their next game. 

The Thunder (31-23) have rode Russell Westbrook's triple-double train all year and they got another one here. Westbrook finished with 29 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals. Victor Oladipo finished second on the team with 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Steven Adams was third on the team with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Cameron Payne was the only bench player in double figures, as he dropped 15 points. Oklahoma City will have to play the Golden State Warriors for their next game on Saturday.

												The host Dallas Mavericks defeated the Utah Jazz on Thursday, 112-105, in overtime at American Airlines Center.

Dallas (21-32) bounced back from two straight losses with a clutch overtime victory against the surging Jazz. Despite Utah leading for much of the game, Dallas was able to pull close at the end of regulation and dominate OT. Forward Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks' offense, scoring 31 points on 12-of-20 shooting. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki, meanwhile, scored 20 points including the shot that forced the Jazz into overtime. Nowitzki's veteran presence and scoring touch has been an integral part of the Mavericks' season beginning to turn around. The team failed to find outside shooting on Thursday, hitting only five three-pointers, but made over 50 percent of its shots from the field on the night.

Utah (34-20), meanwhile, snapped a four-game winning streak with the overtime collapse. The Jazz had led for most of regulation but seemingly ran out of steam at the end of the game, ceding plenty of offense to the Mavericks in OT. Utah saw 36 points from All-Star forward Gordon Hayward, but had a sub-par offensive night outside of his performance. The team hit 13 three-pointers but shot five percent worse from the field than their opponent.  

Dallas will host the Magic on Saturday, while Utah will host the Celtics.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 120-111, at Moda Center on Thursday. 

The Celtics (34-19) improved to 15-11 on the road and pulled closer to the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers with the tough road victory against the Blazers (23-31). Portland got off to a strong start and led the game at the half 55-49, but an explosive offensive outburst by the Celtics in the final period where Boston scored 43 points was enough to tilt the matchup in their favor. Boston was down as many as 15 points at one point earlier on, however, Isaiah Thomas, who has built upon his league-leading fourth quarter points total, put up another big 15 points in the final period. Thomas went on to lead all scorers with 34 points in the contest. 

Portland saw most of its offense from three specific players. Unsurprisingly, the backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combined for 48 points on 38 shots, while Al-Farouq Aminu poured in 26 points on 8-of-12 shooting off the bench. Portland out shot the Celtics from both the field and behind the arc, but Boston had a major advantage on steals (8-4) and turnovers (8-15), which was part of the reason the Blazers were unable to hold on to their lead. Celtics rookie Jaylen Brown had an all-around solid performance with 14 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two three-pointers made. 

Next up, the Celtics visit the Utah Jazz on Saturday, while the Blazers take some time off before hosting the Atlanta Hawks on Monday.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 111-103, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

The Spurs (40-12) have undoubtedly observed that the Sixers (18-34) seem to be a different team from seasons past, when their presence on a schedule almost guaranteed a win. Philadelphia has been most effective at home, where they've managed a 12-15 record. It was therefore no surprise that it took double-digit scoring from all five San Antonio starters and success rates of over 50 percent from the field and three-point range for the visitors to tough out a win. The Spurs were unable to truly separate from their hosts at any point, as the Sixers battled impressively despite the continued absence of Joel Embiid. San Antonio also was buoyed by the return of Kawhi Leonard, who had missed Monday's contest against the Grizzlies with a quad injury.

Leonard led the way for San Antonio with 32 points, six rebounds and five assists. Tony Parker followed with 18 points, five assists and a rebound. LaMarcus Aldridge posted a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included a pair of blocks. Danny Green poured in 11 points and supplemented them with three rebounds and a pair of steals. Dewayne Dedmon supplied a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and a block. Davis Bertans led the bench with nine points, one rebound and one assist.

Dario Saric and Jahlil Okafor turned in matching 20-point efforts to pace the Sixers. The former added three assists and one rebound, while the latter registered eight boards and a pair of blocks. Robert Covington stepped up with 18 points, six rebounds, one assist and two steals. Nik Stauskas was back on the bench but contributed 16 points, seven rebounds and seven assists over 32 minutes. Ersan Ilyasova chipped in 11 points, three assists, two rebounds and one steal. 

The Spurs next head to the Motor City where they'll take on the Detroit Pistons on Friday night, while the Sixers head to Central Florida for a date with the Orlando Magic on Thursday evening.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Indiana Pacers, 132-117, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday. 

Despite the Pacers leading by 11 after the first quarter, the Cavaliers cruised to an easy win. The third quarter was the difference in the game, with Cleveland outscoring Indiana, 40-18. Efficiency was the key for the Cavaliers, as they shot 55 percent from the field and 92 percent from the free-throw line. The Cleveland bench was a huge spark as well, outscoring Indiana's bench, 50-28.

The Cavaliers (36-15) have now won six of their last seven games, as this comeback shows just how scary they can be. Kyrie Irving was the player of the game, as he tallied 29 points, seven assists and two steals. Kyle Korver tied the team-high with 29 points, as he shot 10-of-12 from the field off the bench. LeBron James finished with 25 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Kevin Love shot just 4-of-11 from the field, but totaled 14 points and 11 rebounds. On deck for Cleveland is a road matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday. 

The Pacers (29-23) defeated the Cavaliers earlier this season without LeBron James, but this was a different story. C.J. Miles led the team in scoring, as he dropped 23 points on 6-of-9 from three-point range. Jeff Teague was Indiana's best player, as he accumulated 22 points, five rebounds, 14 assists and two steals. Paul George collected 22 points, eight rebounds, six assists and two steals. Monta Ellis was the only bench player with more than five points, as he provided 13 points, two rebounds and three assists. Indiana will be in Washington on Friday for their next game against the Wizards.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 114-110, in overtime at Barclays Center on Wednesday. 

The Nets (9-44) continue to sport the NBA's worst record, but that hasn't deterred them from playing hard in the majority of recent games. Such was the case again Wednesday, as Brooklyn battled back from a 59-49 halftime deficit to knot matters up at 100 with 41 seconds left on a Bojan Bogdanovic six-foot jumper. Bogdanovic, Trevor Booker and John Wall would go on to miss baskets before the clock hit double zeros, sending the game into overtime. The two teams continued to trade the lead for nearly the first four minutes of overtime before a pair of Otto Porter free throws with 1:21 remaining gave the Wizards (31-21) a lead they wouldn't relinquish. Wall and Bradley Beal would go on to sink a pair of baskets apiece from the charity stripe as well, providing Washington with the breathing room they needed to seal the win.

Washington was led by Beal's 31 points, which he supplemented with six rebounds, two assists and two steals. Wall posted a 23-point, 12-assist double-double that also included six rebounds, two blocks and one steal. Porter provided a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a steal. Marcin Gortat posted 14 points, 14 boards, one assist, one steal and one block. Jason Smith led the second unit with 15 points, eight rebounds and one steal. 

Bogdanovic paced the Nets with 21 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Brook Lopez provided 20 points, six rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson registered a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists and one steal. Booker continued to be highly productive off the bench, tallying a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists and one block. Sean Kilpatrick managed 10 points, four rebounds and two assists. 

The Wizards head back home to do battle with the Indiana Pacers on Friday night, while the Nets remain home to face off with the Miami Heat on Friday evening as well.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Denver Nuggets, 117-106, at Philips Arena on Wednesday. 

Wire-to-wire wins are rare in the NBA, but Atlanta was able to capture one here, despite the game being decided late in the fourth quarter. In fact, the Hawks ended the game on an 8-1 run to cap off the wire-to-wire victory. Atlanta's offense was extremely efficient, as they shot 51 percent from the field and recorded 31 assists. Denver shot just 40 percent from the field and went 13-of-21 from the free-throw line. 

The Nuggets (23-29) are as beat-up as anyone right now and they simply didn't have enough ammunition to win this road game. Wilson Chandler carried the load, as he tallied 24 points, eight rebounds, two assists, and two steals. Nikola Jokic was second on the team in scoring, as he totaled 18 points and 14 rebounds. Will Barton was a huge spark off the bench, as he provided 17 points, seven rebounds, seven assists, three steals and two blocks. Kenneth Faried left after nine minutes, as he suffered an ankle sprain. 

The Hawks (31-22) have been a different team over recent weeks and wire-to-wire wins show just how well they're playing right now. Dennis Schroder was the player of the game, as he accumulated 24 points, five rebounds, 10 assists and three steals. Paul Millsap wasn't far behind, collecting 23 points, six rebounds and five assists. Dwight Howard recorded an 11-point, 13-rebound double-double. Tim Hardaway Jr. and Kent Bazemore each scored 14 points apiece.

The Pistons (25-28) have certainly had their share of ups and downs this season, but have recently been on a modest upswing, checking into Wednesday's contest as winners in three of their previous four games. Even through their struggles, their defense has largely been consistent, and such was the case again Wednesday. Detroit created a whopping 21 turnovers, while also limiting the Lakers (18-37) to 43.0 percent shooting overall. After a competitive first half, they clamped down in the third quarter, winning the period by a 36-20 margin and establishing the cushion they needed to seal a comfortable home win. 

The Lakers were led by matching 17-point efforts from Julius Randle and Lou Williams, with the former also hauling in six rebounds and one assist, and the latter tallying two assists, one rebound and two steals. Brandon Ingram pitched in with 15 points, five assists and four rebounds. Jordan Clarkson totaled 12 points, a rebound and two steals over 22 minutes off the bench. Nick Young supplied nine points, two rebounds and a steal. Tarik Black posted eight points but also brought down 10 boards, dished out three assists and recorded one block.  

The Pistons were led by a 24-point, 17-rebound double-double from Andre Drummond that also included four blocks and a trio of steals. Jon Leuer was next with 20 points, three rebounds, three assists and one steal. Tobias Harris led the second unit with 19 points, five rebounds, one assist and one steal. Marcus Morris managed 14 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Aron Baynes and Ish Smith turned in matching 10-point efforts off the bench, with the former adding six rebounds and one block and the latter supplying seven assists, four rebounds and two steals. 

The Lakers continue their trek through the Midwest with a visit to the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night, while the Pistons remain home to face the San Antonio Spurs on Friday evening as well.

												The Miami Heat defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 106-88, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Wednesday.

These are two teams going in opposite directions and this result shows just which way they're both headed. It was a wire-to-wire win for Miami, as they led by double-digits for the majority of the game, after a 28-15 first quarter. The Heat dominated down low, as they won the rebounding differential, 48-34 and the points in the paint battle, 54-44. Free-throw shooting really killed Milwaukee, as they went just 16-of-28 from the charity stripe. 

The Heat (23-30) have now won 12-straight games, as they continue to be the hottest team in the NBA. Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game, as he totaled 23 points and 16 rebounds on 10-of-12 shooting. James Johnson finished second on the team with 20 points, four rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks off the bench. Goran Dragic accrued 16 points, four rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Wayne Ellington got the start for Dion Waiters (ankle) and scored 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting. 

The Bucks (22-29) have lost 11 of their last 13 games and a date with the Heat is the last thing they wanted to see. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the lone bright spot for Milwaukee, as he accumulated 22 points, eight rebounds and two steals. Jabari Parker was the only other starter in double figures, as he amassed 14 points and two assists. However, Parker went down with a knee injury and had to be carried off the court, so there are some major concerns over his availability moving forward. Michael Beasley led the bench in scoring, dropping 11 points in 12 minutes. Khris Middleton (hamstring) made his season debut and collected five points, two rebounds and two assists in 14 minutes of action.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Phoenix Suns, 110-91, on Wednesday at FedExForum. 

This was a wire-to-wire win for the Grizzlies (33-22), as they have now won three straight games and six of their last seven. Mike Conley led the way for Memphis, shooting an impressive 4-of-5 from behind the arc and 7-of-10 from the field overall. Marc Gasol added 19 points, seven rebounds and three assists, and six total Grizzlies ended up scoring in double-figures. As a team, Memphis managed to do heavy damage from long range, shooting a hot 14-of-24 (58.3 percent) from behind the arc. The victory did come, however, with a bit of recklessness, as the Grizzlies recorded 22 total turnovers on just 24 assists.

For the Suns (16-37), their struggles continued, as Wednesday's loss was their third in a row and eighth in the last nine games. And this one was one of the more forgetful outings, as the team shot just 33.3 percent from the field and 21.7 percent from behind the arc. They also managed to play rather recklessly, recording just 13 assists to their 15 total turnovers. Devin Booker ended up leading the way with a team-high 20 points, while Eric Bledsoe had a disastrous night shooting from the field, going just 3-of-15 en route to scoring 16 points. 

Up next, the Grizzlies will look to keep rolling at home against the Warriors on Friday, while the Suns will look to turn things around Friday at home against the Bulls.

												The visiting Utah Jazz destroyed the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, 127-94.  

Utah (34-19) earned its fourth straight victory in style on Wednesday, eviscerating the Pelicans in one of their most convincing wins of the season. The Jazz outscored the Pels in every quarter and seemingly could do no wrong all night. They finished shooting over 54 percent with 14 three-pointers, 25 assists, and a 48-37 advantage in rebounding. One key difference-maker was the strength of Utah's bench. Veteran Joe Johnson led the team in scoring with 27 points off the bench, while two other members of the second unit scored in double figures. It was a strong night for Utah's starters as well, including center Rudy Gobert. Gobert played stellar defense on New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, and also pulled down a team-high 16 rebounds.

New Orleans (20-33), meanwhile, has now lost five of its last six games. Despite a strong defensive night in which he blocked six shots, star big man Anthony Davis had a lackluster performance on the offensive end, shooting just 4-of-12 for only 12 points. One of the main struggles for New Orleans was hitting shots from long-range, as the team shot only 5-of-20 from beyond the arc. Ball movement was also an issue, as the team posted only 17 assists on the night.  

The Jazz will visit Dallas to play the Mavericks on Thursday, while New Orleans will travel to Minnesota to battle the Timberwolves on Friday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Toronto Raptors, 112-109, on Wednesday at Target Center. 

The Raptors (33-22) held a fairly comfortable lead for the majority of Wednesday's contest until a fourth quarter surge from the Timberwolves (20-33) brought the game close down the stretch. And while Minnesota stars Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns shined bright, the hero ultimately ended up being Tyus Jones. Jones, who made a habit of hitting clutch shots in college at Duke, did it on the NBA stage Wednesday night, hitting what would go on to be the game-winning three-pointer with 21 seconds left and the game tied, effectively ending the the Timberwolves' four-game losing streak. Jones played 27 minutes but finished the game with just five points. Wiggins, on the other hand, scored a game-high 31 points on 11-of-19 shooting from the field, while Towns scored 29 points of his own to go along with a game-high 14 rebounds. 

As for Toronto, DeMar DeRozan had another productive outing in his second game back from injury, scoring a team-high 30 points in 38 minutes. Kyle Lowry added 20 points of his own, while DeMarre Carroll was productive offensively and on the glass, recording 19 points and a team-high nine rebounds in 34 minutes. In the end, the Raptors got great all-around performances from their starting five, but their lack of bench production ultimately prevented them from getting over the hump. Between the six reserves that saw the floor for Toronto on Wednesday, they managed to produce just 20 total points.

Up next, the Timberwolves will take on the Pelicans at home Friday, while the Raptors will have off until Sunday when they take on the Pistons.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers took down the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, 119-115.

During the first half, Knicks legend Charles Oakley was escorted out by security and later arrested by New York City police after a confrontation with franchise owner James Dolan. Oakley had been in attendance of the game. The Knicks quickly issued a PR statement condemning Oakley's behavior and stating that the organization ""hopes he will get help soon.""

The incident did not detract from the competitiveness of the basketball game, however, as the Clippers (32-21) narrowly escaped with the win. Superstar point guard Chris Paul (thumb) remained out, and point guard Austin Rivers struggled in his place. Rivers shot just 3-of-10 with five turnovers. Offense was still fairly easy to come by for the Clippers, though, as center DeAndre Jordan recorded a career-high 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting while All-Star forward Blake Griffin scored another 32. Los Angeles entered the fourth quarter trailing by seven but went on an offensive tear to finish the game, establishing a lead in the final minutes.

The Knicks (22-32), meanwhile, have had the league's second-worst record since the start of the new year. Though four starters scored at least 18 points, bench production was nowhere to be found for the struggling Knicks. No member of New York's second unit scored more than five points, and the bench combined to shoot just 6-of-20 from the field. Despite that, the Knicks shot 50 percent as a team and were able to take a solid Clippers team to the brink of defeat.  

New York will host the Nuggets on Friday, while the Clippers will visit Charlotte on Saturday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Chicago Bulls, 123-92, on Wednesday at Oracle Arena.

This game was essentially over before it started, with the Bulls (26-27) ruling out both Jimmy Butler (heel) and Dwyane Wade (illness) prior to tip-off. As a result, the Warriors (44-8) stomped all over the undermanned Bulls, and while Chicago did their best to hang around, Golden State made sure with a dominant fourth quarter that there would be no upset that night. Klay Thompson led the way for the Warriors, shooting 10-of-18 from the field and 6-of-9 from behind the arc en route to a game-high 28 points. Kevin Durant put together a great all-around performance, recording 20 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in just 31 minutes, while Draymond Green produced a lighter version of that stat line, posting 19 points, eight rebounds and six assists in 32 minutes. As a team, Golden State was hitting on all cylinders, shooting 55.8 percent from the field and 53.6 percent from behind the arc. 

As for the Bulls, Paul Zipser filled in for Wade in the starting lineup while Michael Carter-Williams continued to fill the gap left by Butler. However, the two combined to go just 1-of-10 from the field with Zipser leaving the game due to an ankle injury after playing just 10 minutes and taking one shot. That left Carter-Williams to go just 1-of-9 from the field and finish with three points. Robin Lopez ended up leading the way with a rare double-double for the big man, posting a team-high 17 points and 10 rebounds in 29 minutes. In the end, the absence of Wade and Butler proved to be too much, as the team struggled mightily offensively, shooting just 40.2 percent from the field and 16.7 percent from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Warriors will look to keep things rolling in Memphis against the Grizzlies on Friday, while the Bulls will head to Phoenix on Friday to take on the Suns.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Boston Celtics, 108-92, on Wednesday at Golden 1 Center. 

The Kings (21-32) came into Wednesday's contest with a plethora of injuries, missing the likes of Rudy Gay (Achilles), Omri Casspi (foot) and Garrett Temple (hamstring). However, to make matters worse, DeMarcus Cousins picked up his 15th and 16th technical fouls a game prior, which prompted a one-game suspension, thus ruling out the team's best player. While the Kings weren't expected to even keep the game close, they fought through the adversity and picked up an impressive 16-point win in front of their home crowd. Much of the credit can be given to Darren Collison, who blew up for 26 points, while shooting 12-of-21 from the field and 2-of-4 from the three-point line. To go along with the aforementioned points, Collison also added one rebound, five assists and four steals. Sacramento's bench also came up big, outscoring the the Celtics' reserves, 50-32. That included three double-digit scoring efforts from the likes of Ben McLemore (17), Willie Cauley-Stein (14) and Matt Barnes (14).  As a team, the Kings shot 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from beyond the arc, which easily bested the Celtics' 39.7 percent and 31.3 percent success rates, respectively. 

Isaiah Thomas did everything he could to keep the Celtics (33-19) alive, posting 26 points (6-16 FG, 4-11 3Pt, 10-10 FT), four rebounds and seven assists. He didn't shoot the ball at a high clip, but he got it done at the free throw line, as he connected on all 10 of his attempts. The only other two starters to reach double figures were Amir Johnson and Al Horford, who posted 14 and 10 points, respectively. Perhaps it was the uncertainty of the opposing team, but the Celtics just couldn't keep up with the injury-depleted Sacramento team. The Celtics were once again without Avery Bradley, who's now expected to miss the team's upcoming four-game road trip with a lingering Achilles injury. 

Up next, the Kings will remain at home to play the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday, while the Celtics will remain on the road with a trip to Portland, where they'll be taking on the Trail Blazers.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 111-107, at Spectrum Center on Tuesday.

The Hornets (24-28) had to have come in to Tuesday's tilt with an extra air of confidence, given that the Nets (9-43) had won just two road games in 24 attempts this season. However, Brooklyn came to play, as they did in all four games against Charlotte this season. Their second unit turned in 43 points, and they limited their hosts to 39.2 and 26.9 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively. They also battled back from a 54-37 halftime deficit to score 70 points in the second half. However, two clutch free throws by Marco Belinelli with six seconds remaining provided the final margin of victory for the Hornets.

The Nets were led by Bojan Bogdanovic, who tallied 22 points, five rebounds and one assist, and who drained two his trio of three-pointers in the closing seconds to keep things interesting. Brook Lopez was next with 20 points, five rebounds, one assist and four blocks. Joe Harris led the bench with 12 points, four rebounds and one assist. Isaiah Whitehead was productive as well with 11 points, seven assists, one rebound and one steal in 26 minutes. Trevor Booker posted a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included three assists. Randy Foye filled out the stat sheet with eight points, four rebounds and three assists.

The Hornets saw Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum lead the way with matching 17-point efforts, with the former adding five assists and three boards, and the latter compiling eight boards, four assists, four steals and two blocks. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams managed 14 points apiece. Kidd-Gilchrist also posted seven rebounds, two assists and a block, while Williams hauled in nine boards and a pair of blocks. Frank Kaminsky drew the start at center for the ailing Cody Zeller (quad) and turned in a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included five assists and a steal. Belinelli led the second unit with 17 points, three rebounds and a block, while Jeremy Lamb provided 16 points, seven boards, a steal and a block in 19 highly efficient minutes off the bench.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Orlando Magic, 128-104, on Tuesday at Toyota Center. 

Simply put, this game ended up being a breeze for the Rockets (38-17), who won their second straight game to improve to 20-6 at home this season. James Harden led the way with yet another double-double, recording 25 points and 13 assists, to go along with six rebounds in 36 minutes. Additionally, Trevor Ariza shot his way out of a bad offensive slump, scoring 20 points on 7-of-15 shooting in 36 minutes of his own. This put an end to a five-game stretch where Ariza failed to score more than 10 points. As a team, shots from the outside were falling in bunches for Houston on Tuesday, as the team shot an impressive 16-of-38 from behind the arc (42.1 percent).

As for the Magic (20-34), they didn't have the same kind of success shooting the ball from long range, hitting just 6-of-25 from three-point land in the losing effort. Tuesday's loss marked their second straight since upsetting the Raptors and gives them four losses in their last five games. Serge Ibaka, despite the defeat, did manage to put together one of his best performances of the season so far, scoring 28 points on 13-of-20 shooting -- his second highest total this year -- and grabbed eight rebounds in 41 minutes. His running mate in the frontcourt, Nikola Vucevic, also had a monster game down low, recording a double-double of 14 points and 19 rebounds in 30 minutes.

Up next, the Rockets will look to keep rolling Thursday against the Hornets, while the Magic will head home Thursday to take on the 76ers.

												The visiting Portland Trail Blazers took down the Dallas Mavericks, 114-113, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday.

Portland (23-30) had a startlingly strong performance on the boards after struggling with rebounding all season. The Blazers held a 55-30 advantage on the glass, including 18 boards on the offensive end. Portland was bolstered by strong play from the backcourt tandem of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, as the duo combined for 61 points on the night. Almost everything seemed to be going right for the Blazers, though a few key mistakes kept the game close until the final seconds. The Blazers struggled throughout the night with turnovers and fouls, allowing Dallas to reach the charity stripe 32 times and giving up 15 free possessions on turnovers.

Dallas (20-32) has now hit a two-game speed bump after winning six of its previous seven heading into the week. The team turned out much stronger play on Tuesday than in Monday's blowout loss to Denver, but still came up empty-handed. Three Mavericks scored at least 23 points on Tuesday, with forward Harrison Barnes delivering a team-high 26. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki, meanwhile, had a vintage outing as he scored 25 points on the night. Perhaps the biggest story for Dallas, though, was the continuation of D-League call-up Yogi Ferrell's success. The rookie saw another 35 minutes of play and delivered 12 points on respectable shooting.  

Dallas will host the Jazz on Thursday, while Portland will host the Celtics.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the New York Knicks, 121-107, at Madison Square Garden on Monday night.

The Knicks (22-31) have been mired in controversy on and off the court in recent weeks, with rumors swirling about a possible trade of franchise cornerstone Carmelo Anthony and losses in three of their last four games. The Lakers (18-36) aren't in much better shape, however, and came into Monday's contest with only five road wins in 28 games away from the Staples Center this season. However, a sterling effort from the Los Angeles bench that generated over half of the team's scoring total helped lead the way to a relatively easy victory. The visitors were sharp from the jump, building a 29-19 lead after one and a 61-45 advantage by halftime. That edge was 97-73 after three quarters, and even with New York showing some signs of life in garbage time, the Lakers still coasted to a double-digit road victory.

The Lakers were led by Lou Williams off the bench, who tallied 22 points, four assists, two rebounds and one steal in 26 minutes. Nick Young was next and paced the starters with 17 points, which he complemented with five rebounds and one steal. Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle followed with matching 14-point efforts, with the former also providing seven boards, two assists and one steal, and the latter offering two rebounds, two assists and one block. Tarik Black posted a modest nine points but hauled in 10 boards and recorded one steal. D'Angelo Russell (four points, six assists, two rebounds) was minimally involved, but Jordan Clarkson (12 points) and emerging rookie Ivica Zubac (10 points) were productive as reserves as well.

The Knicks were paced by Anthony's 26 points, which he supplemented with five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Kristaps Porzingis registered a near double-double of 16 points, nine boards and a pair of blocks. Brandon Jennings matched his total off the bench and added five assists, three rebounds and one steal. Justin Holiday was productive on the second unit as well with 14 points, one rebound and one block. Kyle O'Quinn drew the start at center and produced 10 points, two rebounds and one assist, while Derrick Rose, back in the starting lineup after a four-game absence due to an ankle injury, generated just five points, four rebounds and three assists over 32 minutes. Willy Hernangomez continued his strong play by tallying eight points, 13 rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block over 24 minutes off the bench.

The Lakers continue their trek through the Eastern Conference with a visit to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, while the Knicks remain home to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Washington Wizards in overtime, 140-135, at Verizon Center on Monday.

Best game of the season gets thrown around a lot in this racket far too often, but this overtime thriller certainly placed its name in the running. In order to get to the overtime, LeBron James banked in a miracle fadeaway three-pointer to tie the game with 0.3 seconds left. Prior to that, there were five ties and five lead changes in the fourth quarter alone, with both teams making shot after shot. For the game, there were 15 ties and 16 lead changes, with neither team ever leading by double-digits. The key for Cleveland was the three-point shooting, as they went 19-of-38, while Washington went just 12-of-29 from long distance. 

The Cavaliers (35-15) have now won five of their last six games, as this might be their most impressive victory of the season. Despite fouling out in overtime, LeBron James was the player of the game, finishing with 32 points, seven rebounds, 17 assists, two steals and two blocks. Kevin Love led the team in scoring, as he accumulated 39 points, 12 rebounds, three assists and three steals. Kyrie Irving scored 11 of his 23 points in overtime, adding five assists to his tally. Tristan Thompson totaled 22 points and 12 rebounds. Cleveland will play the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday for their next game.

The Wizards (31-21) had won 17-straight home games headed into this matchup and it took a monster effort from the Cavaliers to snap that lengthy streak. Bradley Beal was Washington's best player, as he led the team with 41 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Otto Porter was second on the team, collecting 25 points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals. John Wall accumulated 22 points, four rebounds and 12 assists.  On deck for Washington is a road game against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 93-90, on Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 

It wasn't a great start for the Pacers (29-22), who were essentially run off the floor by the Thunder (30-23) in the first half, getting outscored by Russell Westbrook and company by 11 points in the opening 12 minutes. Then, something clicked, as while Indiana was not impressive on offense by any means -- they shot just 38 percent from the field as a team -- they managed to do just enough to pull away late. Paul George ended up leading the way for the Pacers, scoring 21 points on top of eight rebounds, four assists and three steals in 33 minutes. Jeff Teague added 17 points of his own, while Glenn Robinson III had a solid night off the bench, shooting 5-of-5 from the field en route to 14 points. Indiana has now won seven games in a row. 

As for Oklahoma City, Westbrook tried to do everything he could to keep his team around late, but ultimately it wasn't enough. Westbrook finished just one assist shy of a triple-double, recording a game-high 27 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists in 37 minutes. Beyond Westbrook, center Steven Adams posted 15 points and nine rebounds, while Victor Oladipo finished with 14 points despite a horrible shooting night, as he went 4-of-16 from the field. As a team, the Thunder didn't manage to shoot much more effectively than the Pacers, as they shot 38.6 percent from the field and an underwhelming 25 percent from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Pacers will remain home Wednesday to take on the Cavaliers, while the Thunder will be waiting at home for the Cavaliers on Thursday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 118-109, at Air Canada Centre on Monday night. 

The Raptors (32-21) had been mostly floundering in the absence of DeMar DeRozan, who'd missed six of the previous seven games heading into Monday's contest with an ankle injury. The Clippers (31-20) certainly could relate, as they continue to be without star point guard and defensive wizard Chris Paul, who remains sidelined following thumb surgery. Toronto had the good fortune of getting their star back for Monday's marquee battle and it made all the difference, as DeRozan got right back into the swing of things with a game-high 31 points that he supplemented with five rebounds, two assists and one steal. He was an impressive 11-for-22 from the floor and even drained two of three tries from beyond the arc, a rarity for a player who primarily specializes in mid-range jumpers. Toronto shot a solid 48.8 percent from the floor overall, and 41.7 percent from three-point range.

The Clippers were led once again by Blake Griffin, who produced a 26-point, 11-rebound, 11-assist triple-double that also included one steal. The star forward was effective from all over the court, shooting 11-for-19 from the floor and 2-for-3 from long distance. Austin Rivers followed with 22 points, two rebounds and one block. Marreese Speights led the bench with 15 points, two rebounds, two assists and two steals. Jamal Crawford supplied 14 points, three assists, one rebound, two steals and two blocks. J.J. Redick pitched in with 12 points, four boards, an assist and a steal.

Kyle Lowry played a complementary role with DeRozan back in action, registering 24 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas rounded out a productive night for Toronto's Big Three with a 21-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included two dimes and a block. DeMarre Carroll filled out the stat sheet with nine points, five rebounds and a pair of assists. Cory Joseph led the second unit with 12 points, four rebounds and two assists. 

The Clippers remain on their East Coast swing with a trip to the Big Apple to tangle with the New York Knicks on Wednesday night, while the Raptors hit the road as well to do battle with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday evening.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Atlanta Hawks, 120-95, at Philips Arena on Monday.

In a battle between two of the stingiest defenses in the league, the Jazz had their best shooting game of the season. In fact, Utah shot 61 percent from the field and recorded 31 assists. That's far better than Atlanta's 45 percent shooting and 16 assists. Rebounding was a huge factor as well, with Utah winning that battle, 44-30. The Jazz did most of their damage in the paint, winning the points in the paint differential, 58-44. This was a wire-to-wire win for the Jazz, as they held a double-digit lead for the final 15 minutes. 

The Jazz (33-19) haven't had all their pieces fully healthy much this season, but a win like this shows how scary they can be at full tilt. Gordon Hayward was the player of the game, as he tallied 30 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two steals. Derrick Favors had one of his best games of the season, totaling 20 points, 10 rebounds, three steals and two blocks on 10-of-12 shooting. George Hill finished second on the team in scoring, collecting 22 points, four rebounds and eight assists. Rudy Gobert was the only other Jazz player in double figures, as he provided 14 points, six rebounds, three assists and three blocks. 

The Hawks (30-22) have been inconsistent all season and blowout losses like this at home are head scratchers to say the least. Dennis Schroder carried the load, as he amassed 21 points, two rebounds and two assists. Paul Millsap went just 4-of-14 from the field, but finished with 14 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Tim Hardaway Jr. also scored 14 points, adding three rebounds and three assists to his tally.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 113-96, on Monday at Palace of Auburn Hills. 

The Pistons (24-28) continued to play the good basketball they've been playing as of late, notching their third win in four games. And they did so with great team basketball, as all five of their starters managed to score in double figures in what was a dominant game for the home team. Andre Drummond was a monster down low, recording yet another double-double of 16 points and 17 rebounds, while Marcus Morris led the way scoring for Detroit, posting 19 points on 9-of-16 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds of his own. In the end, eight different Pistons players managed to score in double figures in what was a fairly effortless victory. 

On the other hand, after a hot start to the new year, the 76ers (18-33) are slowing down once again, as they have now lost six of their last seven games following Monday's result, and it appears as though the absence of Joel Embiid (knee) has finally caught up to them. His replacement, Jahlil Okafor, on a night where he was subject to trade rumors, led the way for Philly, scoring 16 points on 7-of-11 shooting in 26 minutes. He did, however, manage to grab just four rebounds. Dario Saric was solid off the bench, recording 13 points, six rebounds and four assists, but overall, it was a forgettable night for a 76ers team that shot a brutal 18 percent from behind the arc on 28 attempts. 

Up next, the Pistons will look to keep up their winning ways Wednesday against the Lakers, while the 76ers will have a matchup Wednesday with the Spurs.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Phoenix Suns, 111-106, at Smoothie King Center on Monday. 

In a battle between Western Conference bottom-dwellers, the Pelicans were able to prevail with a big win in a close-fought battle. There were 16 ties and 13 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 10. New Orleans finished the game strong, as they ended the game on a 15-5 run. Defense was key for the Pelicans, as they forced 16 turnovers and recorded a combined 22 blocks and steals. Three-point shooting was the Suns downfall, as they went just 5-of-27 from long distance. 

The Suns (16-36) have now lost seven of their last eight games, as they continue to struggle. T.J. Warren led the team in scoring, as he tallied 20 points, four rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Devin Booker did finish with 14 points, two rebounds and five assists, but shot just 5-of-20 from the field. Eric Bledsoe tied Booker with 14 points, but added eight rebounds and five assists to his tally. Tyson Chandler recorded a double-double, totaling 11 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks.  

The Pelicans (20-32) are one of many teams fighting for the eight-seed in the West and wins like this are crucial for that pursuit. Anthony Davis once again carried the load, as he accumulated 34 points, nine rebounds, two steals and five blocks in the win. Jrue Holiday was just as good, collecting 30 points, nine rebounds, seven assists and three blocks. E'Twaun Moore was the next highest scorer, as he provided 12 points, four rebounds and four steals off the bench.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 115-113, at Target Center on Monday. 

Late in the contest, with 17.0 seconds left, the Heat (22-30) held an eight-point lead and were seemingly well on their way to their 11th straight victory. But then, a couple of Miami turnovers and a few big plays from Andrew Wiggins later, the Timberwolves (19-33) had one last chance to either tie or take the lead with eight seconds remaining in the game. However, Wiggins' fallaway mid-range jumper would not go down and the time would expire, and the Heat's miraculous win streak remained alive. In the end, it was the Goran Dragic show in Minneapolis, with the point guard hitting nearly everything he threw up and finishing with a team-high 33 points on 13-of-17 shooting from the field and 7-of-9 shooting from behind the arc on top of nine assists. And that hot shooting was contagious, as the rest of the Miami players launched from three-point land with plenty of confidence and the team shot an astounding 53.6 percent from long range, solidifying them as one of the hottest teams in basketball.

As for Minnesota, they got impressive performances out of their two stars in Karl-Anthony Towns and Wiggins, but they were unable to walk away with the victory in their second game without Zach LaVine, who is out for the season with a torn ACL. Towns finished with a game-high 35 points and eight rebounds, while Wiggins' late-game heroics and a 21-point second half led to him finishing with 27 points on 11-of-23 shooting from the field. Ricky Rubio also had yet another double-double, scoring 14 rebounds and dishing out 13 assists. Overall, it was an efficient game for the Timberwolves, who shot 54 percent from the field, but it ended up just being too little too late. 

Up next, the Heat will look to make it 12 straight wins Wednesday against the Bucks, while the Timberwolves will look to avoid their fifth straight loss Wednesday against the Raptors.

												The host Denver Nuggets demolished the Dallas Mavericks, 110-87, at Pepsi Center on Monday.

Denver (23-28) is still narrowly holding on to eighth in the Western Conference standings after Monday's win. In an odd twist, Denver saw a bit of a dip in production from star sophomore big man Nikola Jokic, who has led Denver's playoff push since joining the starting lineup. Though Jokic dished out a team-high of nine assists, he had only 13 points and just four rebounds. Still, the big man made an impact, and needed to do little else as the team cruised to a massive victory. Versatile wing Will Barton earned the start on Monday for Denver and led the team with 31 points, also pulling down eight rebounds and dishing out five assists. As a team, Denver hit a stellar 50 percent of its shots while draining 11 three-pointers.

Dallas (20-31) lost a four-game win streak on Monday, and did so in unfortunate style. A 22-point halftime deficit proved too much for Dallas to overcome, as there were no inklings of a Super Bowl-esque comeback in Denver. Five players scored in double digits, but no one recorded more than 15 points. Meanwhile, the team shot just 43 percent and hit only eight three-pointers on the night. The performance was certainly not what Dallas needed as the team looks to be in the mix for a potential playoff spot down the stretch.

Dallas will host the Trail Blazers on Tuesday, while the Nuggets will visit Atlanta to play the Hawks on Wednesday.

												The host Memphis Grizzlies shut down the powerhouse San Antonio Spurs, 89-74, at FedExForum Arena on Monday.

Defense was the key for the Grizzlies (32-22), who held the Spurs to just 36 percent shooting and a season-low scoring output. The absence of Spurs superstar Kawhi Leonard (quad) certainly helped the Grizzlies' case, but it was a stunning defensive performance nonetheless. The ""Grit and Grind"" Grizz blocked a whopping 11 shots on the night, including three off the bench from big man Brandan Wright. Though the Grizz struggled on offense, hitting just four three-pointers and shooting under 40 percent, the team forced an even tougher night for its opponent. Memphis forced an unusual 16 turnovers from the Spurs.

San Antonio (39-12) remains the league's second-best team, but certainly could have used Leonard's offense on Monday. In his absence, the team's high scorer was bench veteran David Lee, who contributed only 14 points in 17 minutes of play. It was a particularly off night for San Antonio in terms of ball movement, as the team recorded only 11 assists on the night. The Spurs hit just four three-pointers and were unable to match the defensive intensity of their tough opponent.

The Spurs will visit Philadelphia on Wednesday, while Memphis will host the Suns.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Sacramento Kings, 112-107, at Golden 1 Center on Monday. 

The Bulls (26-26) were without starting small forward Jimmy Butler (heel) on Monday, but veteran Dwyane Wade scored 31 points to lead all scorers and also led Chicago to the impressive road victory. DeMarcus Cousins was a monster on the glass, but was unable to pour in the scoring effort needed to keep the Kings (20-32) within a true shot of winning. Sacramento fell behind early, exiting the first quarter with just 11 points as a team, but managed a strong fourth quarter effort despite falling short. 

Wade's 31 points came with six rebounds, three assists and one steal on 12-of-18 shooting. Michael Carter-Williams drew the start in favor of Butler, and went on to score 21 points, grab six rebounds and dished out four assists. Robin Lopez went for 17 points, while all five starters finished in double figures in scoring. 

Ty Lawson was the most effective player offensively for the Kings, and finished with 22 points in 35 minutes off the bench. Cousins' 18 points led the starters, to go with 14 rebounds, five assists and one block on 5-of-16 shooting. 

Both teams play again on Wednesday, as the Kings host the Boston Celtics, while the Bulls visit the Golden State Warriors.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 103-95, at Barclays Center on Sunday. 

The Raptors (31-21) entered Sunday's contest trying to break out of a considerable funk that had seen them drop eight of their last 10 games. Their struggles have largely coincided with the absence of DeMar DeRozan (ankle), who's missed five contests during that span. However, the reeling Nets (9-42) proved to be exactly the cure for what ailed them Sunday, as they turned the ball over a whopping 21 times on the way to their 20th home loss of the season. Jonas Valanciunas (22 points) and Kyle Lowry (15-point, 11-rebound, 11-assist triple-double) stepped up to make up for DeRozan's absence, and Toronto shot 46.0 percent from the field overall.

Valanciunas added five rebounds and a steal to his team-high scoring total. Lowry also added a steal to his stellar effort. DeMarre Carroll equaled Lowry's scoring total and added five rebounds, one assist, three steals and one block. Norman Powell mustered 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and one block. Terrence Ross led the bench with 17 points, three rebounds, two assists and one block. Fred VanVleet was productive as a reserve as well with 10 points, four assists and three rebounds.

The Nets were paced by Brook Lopez's 20 points, which he supplemented with seven boards, three assists, two blocks and one steal. Bojan Bogdanovic contributed 13 points, three boards and two assists. Sean Kilpatrick led the second unit with 18 points, five rebounds and one steal. Trevor Booker posted a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three steals and two assists, and Justin Hamilton and Spencer Dinwiddie supplied eight and seven points, respectively, off the bench as well.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 107-102, at TD Garden on Sunday.

Despite this game coming down to the final seconds, Boston pulled out the wire-to-wire win over Los Angeles. The first and third quarters are where they made their mark, outscoring the Clippers by 15 in that 24-minute stretch. Boston lived from behind the arc, as they went 16-of-52 from three-point range. The defensive statistics were huge, with the Celtics recording 12 combined blocks and steals to the Clippers' four. 

The Clippers (31-20) had some dud performances from their starting unit and it really let them down in this defeat. Blake Griffin was the lone bright spot among starters, as he tallied 23 points, eight rebounds and four assists. The other four starters combined for just 20 points on 6-of-25 shooting. Jamal Crawford was huge off the bench, as he accumulated 23 points, five assists and three steals. Raymond Felton also played well off the bench, providing 16 points, five rebounds and four assists. 

The Celtics (33-18) have now won seven-straight games, as they continue to fight for that number-one seed. Isaiah Thomas once again carried the load, as he led the team with 28 points and eight assists. Al Horford had one of his best all-around games of the season, collecting 13 points, 15 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. Marcus Smart and Kelly Olynyk came off the bench to score 13 points apiece. 

Paul Pierce made his final appearance in Boston, as he hit his lone three-pointer in the final seconds to please the Boston faithful. 

The Celtics now head to Sacramento to play the Kings on Wednesday, while the Clippers will travel to Toronto to matchup with the Raptors on Monday.

												The host Oklahoma City Thunder narrowly edged out the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, 105-99, at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

Oklahoma City (30-22) managed to swing the game in its favor on the back of strong play from All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook. Despite falling below his typical output in assists and rebounds, Westbrook led the team with a whopping 42 points. His eight assists also led the team. The Thunder hit only four three-pointers on the night, but made up for lackluster perimeter shooting with strong big man play. The Thunder held a 56-44 rebounding advantage that included at least 11 boards from three different players.

Portland (22-30) made headlines for the wrong reasons on Friday after allowing a season-high to Mavericks rookie Yogi Ferrell. On Sunday, the Blazers were unable to bounce back from the loss despite strong play from their own star point guard. After a horrendous game in Dallas, Damian Lillard scored a team-high 29, while pulling down seven rebounds. Portland saw a decent night from beyond the arc, knocking down 10 three-pointers as a team. However, Portland ultimately could not limit Oklahoma City's second chances on the boards.

The Thunder will visit Indiana on Monday to play the Pacers, while the Blazers will head to Dallas again on Tuesday to face off with the Mavericks.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 105-91, at Verizon Center on Saturday evening.

Outside of the Miami Heat, the Wizards (30-20) were one of the Eastern Conference's hottest squads coming in to Saturday's game, having won  six consecutive games. They'd also amassed a 21-6 record at home and were facing a Pelicans (19-32) team that had only notched six victories in 23 road tilts this season, all factors that seemed to point towards another dominant outing. Despite a 25-point, 10-rebound double-double from Anthony Davis, Washington fulfilled that prophecy, limiting New Orleans to just eight points over the final quarter to seal the win. The Pelicans posted just a 29.4 percent success rate from three-point range and also committed 15 turnovers.

Davis added two assists, two blocks and a steal to his team-leading performance. Terrence Jones got the start at power forward and provided 15 points, four rebounds and two blocks. Tyreke Evans posted a bench-leading 15 points and supplemented them with six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Jrue Holiday tallied a stat line of 13 points, 10 boards and eight assists. Solomon Hill and Buddy Hield combined for just 13 points on 6-of-16 shooting.

The Wizards were paced by another stellar performance from John Wall, who generated a 24-point, 13-assist double-double that also featured three rebounds, five steals and one block. Markieff Morris collected 18 points, four rebounds and one steal. Marcin Gortat was a force on the boards once again, totaling 12 points, 17 rebounds and one block. Otto Porter and Bradley Beal both equaled Gortat's scoring total, with the former adding nine rebounds and three steals, and the latter posting five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Kelly Oubre, Jr. led the second unit with 10 points, two rebounds and one block.

The Pelicans head back home to face the Phoenix Suns on Monday evening, while the Wizards remain home to tangle with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Orlando Magic, 113-86, at Philips Arena on Saturday. 

The Magic (20-33) came in to Saturday riding high off a surprise home victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday evening, but they were a markedly different team on the second night of the back-to-back set. The Hawks (30-21) stymied Orlando to the tune of a 34.6 percent success rate from the floor, and 25.9 percent from three-point range. They also outrebounded their visitors by a robust 48-33 margin and essentially decided the game in the first half, when they jumped out to a 65-39 lead. 

Orlando was led by a modest 16-point effort from Aaron Gordon, who also added three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Elfrid Payton was the only other double-digit scorer among the starting five, posting 12 points and three boards. Evan Fournier supplied nine points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal. Nikola Vucevic contributed eight points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Jeff Green provided a bench-leading 12 points and supplemented them with five rebounds and one steal. C.J. Watson and D.J. Augustin were also productive as reserves, tallying matching eight-point efforts. 

The Hawks were led by matching 21-point efforts from Tim Hardaway, Jr. and Paul Millsap, with the former adding five rebounds, two assists and two steals, and the latter registering five boards and four assists. Dennis Schroder stepped up with a 17-point, 10-assist double-double that also included four rebounds and two steals. Dwight Howard managed an 11-point, 13-rebound double-double along with three assists and one steal. Malcolm Delaney paced the second unit with 12 points, one rebound and one assist.

The Magic head to Houston to tangle with the Rockets on Tuesday night, while the Hawks remain home to face the Utah Jazz on Monday evening.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons 105-84, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, on Saturday evening. 

The Pacers earned a season-high sixth straight win, as they dominated the second half to take a 3-0 lead in the season series against Detroit. The Pacers outscored the Pistons 49-26 in the second half, after a fairly evenly matched first half.

All five starters scored in double digits for Indiana (28-22), with Paul George leading the way with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting, to go along with four assists and three rebounds, in 32 minutes. Lavoy Allen came up big in a starting role, as he poured in 18 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, in 32 minutes. Al Jefferson chipped in 13 points off the bench, while Myles Turner, C.J. Miles and Jeff Teague also chipped in 13 points each. The Pacers shot 48.4 percent from the field but struggled a bit from distance, hitting only 7-of-24 from deep. The Pacers will look to keep things rolling, as they play host to the Thunder on Monday.
 
The Pistons (23-28) led by two after the first half, but fell apart in the second. They shot 41.3 percent from the field and 35.3 percent from deep, while doing well to hit 16-of-20 from the free throw line. Marcus Morris was the high-point man for Detroit, with 19, while Jon Leuer followed up with 14 points and Andre Drummond added 13. No other player scored in double digits for the Pistons, as they looked to be out of gas on the second night of a back-to-back. The Pistons will look to bounce back as they play host to the 76ers on Monday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 125-102, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday.

The Heat (21-30) was red-hot coming in to Saturday's contest and seemed primed to continue their streak, considering they were facing a Sixers team that had dropped four of their last five games and would be without their most potent offensive weapon in Joel Embiid (knee). Miami made good on that prognosis, ambushing their vistors by a 32-17 margin in the first quarter and never really letting up. Hassan Whiteside led the way with a monstrous 30-point, 20-rebound double-double that also included a trio of blocks, and the Miami bench totaled 50 points overall. They also posted outstanding 58.5 and 54.5 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, allowing them to overcome the 20 turnovers they were guilty of.

The Sixers (18-32) were led by Ersan Ilyasova, who posted 21 points, five rebounds and two assists. Gerald Henderson was next with 12 points, two assists and two steals. Richaun Holmes followed with a near double-double with 12 points, nine rebounds, two assists and one steal. T.J. McConnell generated 11 points, four assists and two rebounds. Sean Rodriguez contributed 10 points, one rebound and one assist as a reserve as well.

Dion Waiters followed Whiteside with 21 points, seven assists, one rebound, two steals and one block. Goran Dragic was next with 16 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Tyler Johnson led the bench with 16 points, six rebounds, six assists, one block and one steal. Wayne Ellington and James Johnson were productive as reserves as well, with the former tallying 11 points, two rebounds and one steal and the latter offering 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. 

The Sixers head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Monday night, while the Heat head to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Monday evening as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host New York Knicks 111-104, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday evening. 

In the process of winning their second straight game, the Cavaliers saw their leader, LeBron James, become the youngest player in NBA history to score 28,000 career points. James finished with a game-high 32 points in the contest, on impressive 12-of-20 shooting. 

The Cavs (35-15) were without Kyrie Irving, who was a late scratch with a quad injury. DeAndre Liggins got the start in Irving's absence but only played 17 minutes. Cleveland played most of the contest without a true point guard on the floor, but that was not a big issue, as LeBron played the role of distributor, dishing 10 assists. Kevin Love had a solid game, with 23 points and 16 rebounds, in 35 minutes of action. Channing Frye chipped in 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting, in 15 minutes off the bench. The Cavaliers will look to keep the winning streak going as they visit Washington to take on the Wizards on Monday. 

The Knicks (22-30) trailed by 27 with 54 seconds left in the third quarter but went on a massive run, sparked by Brandon Jennings, who poured in 17 points in just over three minutes to help the Knicks get within 10 points with 7:26 left in the fourth. Jennings finished with a team-high 23 points on 8-of-13 shooting, to go along with 10 assists and five rebounds, in 42 minutes of action. Carmelo Anthony struggled from the floor, as he went 6-of-20 on his way to 17 points, while Kristaps Porzingis similarly struggled, with nine points on 3-of-10 shooting. The Knicks will look to get back on track as they play host to the Lakers on Monday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the visiting Charlotte Hornets 105-98, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday evening. 

After trailing by nine at the end of the third, the Jazz rallied back by outscoring the Hornets by 16 in the fourth, behind a season-high 33 points from Gordon Hayward. 

The Jazz (32-19) shot 46.9 percent from the field and out-rebounded the Hornets by 13, as they battled to earn the impressive home win. Hayward added eight rebounds, two assists and one steal to round out an impressive line that includes a season-high 33 points. George Hill came up big with 25 points on efficient 8-of-11 shooting, including 5-of-8 from long range, while Rudy Gobert cleaned the glass with 15 rebounds to go along with eight points, three blocks, two assists and two steals, in 38 minutes. The Jazz are now 19-9 at home but will have to take their show on the road, as they go on to visit Atlanta on Monday. 

The Hornets (23-28) struggled from the field, hitting only 42.7 percent of their shots. Kemba Walker was the high-point man for Charlotte, with 18, to go along with six assists, in 35 minutes. Marvin Williams turned in a solid double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds, to go along with three steals, one assist and one block, in 38 minutes. Frank Kaminsky chipped in 15 points but only grabbed two rebounds, as he got the start at center. This was the seventh straight loss for the Hornets, as they have hit a major slide that has put them in danger of losing their position in the top eight in the East. They will look to end the skid as they play host to the Nets on Tuesday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 137-112, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Saturday evening. 

The Bucks turned in their highest point total of the season, as they ran past the struggling Suns. 

The Bucks (22-28) shot a blistering 63.4 percent from the field, as they scorched the Suns' defense. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee with 30 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and four blocks to stuff the stat sheet. Mirza Teletovic followed up with 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting, to burn his former team. Jabari Parker added 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting, and nine rebounds, as he was solid in 31 minutes. The Bucks are still stuck outside the top eight in the East but will look to continue to claw their way back, as they play host to the Heat on Wednesday. 

The Suns (16-35) shot only 41.8 percent from the field, and were dominated in the paint, where they were outscored 74-42. However, Phoenix saw some great performances from some of it's youngsters, as Marquese Chriss tallied a career-high 27 points on 9-of-16 shooting, to go along with six rebounds, in only 24 minutes. Devin Booker went off for 27 points in the second quarter alone, but cooled down, as he finished with 31 points in the contest. Tyson Chandler grabbed 13 rebounds, while Eric Bledsoe and P.J. Tucker chipped in 13 points each. The Suns remain last place in the West but will continue to fight, as they go on to visit New Orleans on Monday.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Denver Nuggets, 121-97, at AT&T Center on Saturday.

San Antonio were expected to win this game easily and they took care of business in this 24-point victory. The Spurs really took it to the Nuggets in the third quarter, as they turned a six-point halftime lead into a 19-point lead headed into the fourth quarter. Shooting was the key difference, with San Antonio shooting 57 percent, while Denver was held to just 45 percent. The Spurs took advantage of the whistle as well, going 21-of-26 from the free-throw line, with the Nuggets hitting just 5-of-10. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with San Antonio forcing 21 turnovers and recording 29 assists. 

The Nuggets (22-28) had a tough task here in the second half of a back-to-back in San Antonio and that was simply too much to overcome. The starters really struggled, as Nikola Jokic led them with 11 points, one rebound and two assists. The five starters combined for 41 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists and no blocks, while committing 11 turnovers. Jamal Murray was a lone bright spot off the bench, as he dropped 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting. 

The Spurs (39-11) have been dominant at home this season and a win like this shows just how scary of a team they can be. Kawhi Leonard was once again the catalyst, as he led the team with 19 points, six rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Tony Parker was a perfect 8-of-8 from the field and finished with 18 points, four assists and three steals. Manu Ginobili came off the bench to drop 18 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Jonathan Simmons was also effective off the bench, providing 18 points, four rebounds and two assists.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves, 107-99, at Target Center on Saturday.

This was a game full of swings, as the Grizzlies made a huge comeback, despite playing with a depleted roster. After trailing by 16 points in the first quarter, Memphis outscored Minnesota by 24 points over the final three quarters to pull out a comeback win. Defense was key for the Grizzlies, as they won the turnover differential and forced Minnesota to shoot 42 percent from the field. Free-throw shooting was decisive as well, with the Grizzlies hitting 33-of-39, while Minnesota went 19-of-24. 

The Grizzlies (31-22) rested Marc Gasol and Chandler Parsons for this game, but they still walked away with a huge road win. JaMychal Green was the star, as he scored a career-high 29 points to add to his six rebounds. Mike Conley was second on the team, finishing with 20 points, three rebounds and eight assists. James Ennis III started for Parsons and accrued 13 points, six rebounds and two steals. Vince Carter and Troy Daniels were important off the bench, as they scored 11 points a piece. On deck for the Grizzlies is a home matchup against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.

The Timberwolves (19-32) continue to disappoint fans, as they blew a 16-point first quarter lead to a depleted Memphis squad. Karl-Anthony Towns did all he could for Minnesota, as he led the team with 27 points and 16 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins was second on the team, tallying 23 points and five assists. Ricky Rubio accumulated 14 points and six assists, while Gorgui Dieng provided two points and 13 rebounds. The Timberwolves will look to get out of this slide on Monday against the scorching-hot Miami Heat.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Golden State Warriors in overtime, 109-106, at Golden One Center on Saturday. 

The Warriors had 13-straight wins over the Kings in this series headed into this matchup, but Sacramento were able to snap that slide with this overtime win. Sacramento got out to a hot start in the extra session, as they scored the first seven points and never relinquished the lead from there. The Kings bench was the difference in the game, as their five bench players combined for 45 points, 24 rebounds, 10 assists and five steals, while Golden State's five bench players totaled just 16 points, 12 rebounds, four assists and two steals. Sacramento dominated in the paint, as they won the rebounding battle, 46-40 and outscored the Warriors in the paint, 56-34. 

Golden State (43-8) haven't had many games as tough as this and they simply couldn't overcome a monster effort from Sacramento. Steph Curry carried the load for Golden State, as he tallied 35 points, four rebounds, nine assists and three steals. Klay Thompson was second on the team, finishing with 26 points and five rebounds. Draymond Green accumulated 16 points, eight rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. Kevin Durant really struggled, as he scored a season-low 10 points on 2-of-10 shooting. 

Sacramento (20-31) have been plagued by Golden State over recent seasons and this overtime victory may show that they are ready to compete for a playoff berth. DeMarcus Cousins was the player of the game, as he collected 32 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists and two steals. Darren Collison was second on the team, totaling 18 points, two rebounds and three assists. Matt Barnes was huge off the bench, amassing 11 points and 14 rebounds, while shutting down Durant.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Toronto Raptors, 102-94, at Amway Center on Friday.

Despite heading into the contest without the services of DeMar DeRozan (ankle), the Raptors (30-21) were still the clear-cut favorites over the Magic (20-32), which had lost five of their last six games. However, defense is often a great equalizer, and such was the case Friday. Orlando managed to hold Toronto to sub-40-percent tallies from both the floor and three-point range, while also holding two members of their first unit, Patrick Patterson and DeMarre Carroll, scoreless. On the other end of the floor, the Magic benefited from a pair of double-doubles from Evan Fournier and Serge Ibaka that paced them on offense. 

The Raptors were led by a trio of 18-point efforts from Jonas Valanciunas, Kyle Lowry and Norman Powell. Valanciunas added 11 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block, Lowry also provided seven assists, five rebounds and one block, and Powell had a pair of boards, an assist and a steal. Fred VanVleet led the bench with 15 points, three rebounds, three assists and one steal, and Terrence Ross chipped in with 12 points, four rebounds, one assist and one block over 28 minutes as a reserve. 

Ibaka supplied a 20-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included one assist and three blocks. Fournier stepped up with 20 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. Nikola Vucevic was right behind his talented teammates with 18 points, five rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Elfrid Payton tallied 10 points, six assists, four rebounds and one steal. C.J. Watson, back on the bench with Fournier's recent return from injury, led the second unit with 18 points, four assists, three rebounds, two steals and one block. 

The Raptors remain on the road and head to the Big Apple to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday afternoon, while the Magic tangle with the Hawks in Atlanta on Saturday night.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 106-97, at Barclays Center on Friday. 

The Pacers (27-22) came in to Friday's game heading in the right direction, as they'd tallied four straight victories. With losses in their previous seven contests, the Nets (9-41) looked like viable candidates to facilitate an extension of that streak. Indiana wasted no time in establishing the tone, jumping out to a 27-16 lead after one quarter. Brooklyn battled back to make matters close over the balance of the contest, but the Pacers defense was too much for the home team to overcome. Indiana held the Nets to sub-40-percent success rates from the field and three-point range, while also eliciting 19 turnovers. 

Paul George and Jeff Teague co-led the Pacers with matching 24-point efforts, with the former adding 11 rebounds, three assists, three blocks and two steals, and Teague providing seven assists, three rebounds and three steals. Myles Turner played a complementary role on the night, registering 11 points, four rebounds, one assist and three blocks. Thaddeus Young turned in a near double-double with 10 points, nine rebounds, three assists, four steals and two blocks. C.J. Miles poured in nine points, while Al Jefferson led the bench with 11 points and five boards.

The Nets saw their starting five considerably underperform, with Brook Lopez's team-high 23 points serving as the only double-digit scoring effort on the first unit. The big man added six rebounds, an assist and a block. The bench made up for some of the shortfall with a combined 63 points. Sean Kilpatrick led the second unit with 18 points, five rebounds and four assists. Joe Harris stepped up with 15 points, two rebounds and three steals. Spencer Dinwiddie chipped in with 13 points, four rebounds, an assist and a block. Quincy Acy and Trevor Booker turned in matching eight-point efforts as reserves as well.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Chicago Bulls, 121-117, in overtime at Toyota Center on Friday evening. 

The Rockets were trailing by eight points with three minutes left in regulation but surged back to tie it up, thanks to a few major defensive stops, including a couple of steals by Trevor Ariza, and some clutch offense from the likes of James Harden, Eric Gordon and Ariza. The Rockets then owned the overtime period, where they outscored the Bulls 13-9. 

James Harden led the Rockets (37-17) with 42 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, in his franchise-high 34th 40-point game with the Rockets. Three other players scored in double digits for Houston, including Eric Gordon, who came up with 21 points on 8-of-17 shooting, in 34 minutes off the bench. Ryan Anderson went scoreless in 33 minutes, as he went 0-of-7 from the field. The Rockets shot 16-of-43 from deep and struggled from the free throw line, where they hit only 17-of-25. Nonetheless the came out with a huge win, moving to 19-6 at home this season. They now have a couple days off, before they play host to the Magic on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, the Bulls (25-26) fell apart late in the fourth, after they were leading by eight with five minutes to go. They gave up 17 turnovers in the contest, which came back to bite them, as a couple of those directly led to the Rockets' comeback. The Bulls were playing without Jimmy Butler who was a last minute scratch due to a heel injury. Michael Carter-Williams was the high-point man for Chicago, as he finished with 23 points, to go along with nine rebounds, six assists and one block, 35 minutes. Dwyane Wade chipped in 19 points, nine rebounds and six assists, while Taj Gibson added 20 points, six rebounds and three assists.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 114-102, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday evening. 

The Grizzlies led by four after three quarters, but then Russell Westbrook went absolutely ballistic in the fourth quarter, scoring 19 points in the quarter, including 15 points straight and unanswered, to take his team from down 102-99 to the final score of 114-102. This snaps the Grizzlies three-game win streak, while Westbrook added to his ridiculous triple-double count, as he notched his 25th of the season.

The Thunder (29-22) only scored 21 points in the first quarter, before outscoring the Grizz by 12 in the second, to take an eight-point lead into half time. They were then outscored by 12 in the third, and entered the fourth down by four. The Thunder outscored the Grizz by 14 in the fourth, behind Russell Westbrook and his takeover. Westbrook finished with 38 points, 13 rebounds, 12 assists and three steals to lead his squad to a big win. Westbrook also matched a career-best as he went 17-of-17 from the foul line. Three other players scored in double digits for the Thunder, including Steven Adams and Joffrey Lauvergne, who pitched in 16 points each. The Thunder go on to visit Portland on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, the Grizzlies (30-22) saw their win streak come to an end as they went scoreless in the last 2:50 as they were stifled by an overwhelming push of energy and intensity from the Thunder and their home crowd. Marc Gasol finished with a team-high 31 points, to go along with eight assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block, in 42 minutes. Zach Randolph came up big in 29 minutes off the bench, with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Mike Conley chipped in 18 points, three steals and two assists. Chandler Parsons added 12 points on 3-of-6 shooting, in 25 minutes. The Grizzlies will have to put this one in the past, as they go right back in action on Saturday, when they visit Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 113-107, at TD Garden on Friday.

These two teams came into this matchup tied for the most wins in NBA history and the Celtics were able to pull ahead of the Lakers with this victory. The second quarter was the difference in the game, as Boston outscored Los Angeles, 33-21. Defense was also key for the Celtics, as they held the Lakers to 39 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range. Boston shot 48 percent on their end and recorded 28 assists on their 39 made baskets. 

The Lakers (17-36) have now lost 10 of their last 12 games, as they can't get out of their own way. Lou Williams led Los Angeles in scoring, as he provided 21 points, four rebounds and four assists off the bench. D'Angelo Russell led the starters, collecting 20 points, six rebounds and six assists. Nick Young was the only other starter with more than four points, as he dropped 17 points to add to his three rebounds and three assists. Larry Nance Jr. recorded an 18-point, 11-rebound double-double off the bench. 

The Celtics (32-18) have rode Isaiah Thomas' absurd fourth quarter numbers all season and he was at it yet again here. Thomas scored 17 of his 38 points in the fourth quarter, to go along with two rebounds and four assists. Al Horford flirted with a triple-double, accumulating 11 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Jae Crowder was second on the team in scoring, totaling 18 points, six rebounds and two steals. Marcus Smart was a spark plug off the bench, accruing nine points, seven assists and five steals.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 121-117, at Pepsi Center on Friday.

It wasn't the ideal win for Denver considering they nearly blew a monster lead, but they were able to hold on for a much needed victory. In fact, the Nuggets led by 22 in the third quarter, before allowing the Bucks to get it within two points late in the fourth. Denver were able to hold on though, despite missing their last four free-throws. Rebounding was the biggest factor in the game, with Denver winning that battle, 48-38. The Nuggets also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording five more assists and committing four less turnovers. 

The Bucks (21-28) put in a valiant effort to pull out a comeback win, but fell just shy to mark their 10th loss in 11 games. Jabari Parker was Milwaukee's best player, as he accrued 27 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and two steals. Giannis Antetokounmpo wasn't far behind, collecting 23 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. John Henson was the only other Buck in double figures, as he amassed 16 points, five rebounds and four blocks. 

The Nuggets (22-27) have now won eight of their last 12 games, as they couldn't be happier to see Nikola Jokic back and healthy. Jokic recorded his first career triple-double in the win. as he accumulated 21 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists. Wilson Chandler started for Danilo Gallinari (groin) and tallied 23 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and four blocks. Kenneth Faried recorded a double-double, totaling 19 points and 11 rebounds. Jamal Murray was the leading scorer off the bench, dropping 18 points on 5-of-9 from the field.

												The Phoenix Suns took down the Sacramento Kings on Friday, 105-103.

Phoenix (16-34) saw strong play from sophomore Devin Booker in the win, as Booker led the team with 33 points on 11-of-24 shooting.  Per usual, strong backcourt play kept the Suns in the game, as point guard Eric Bledsoe added another 20 points.  The duo of guards contributed seven of Phoenix's 12 three-pointers on the night.  Forward T.J. Warren was also an integral piece of the win, as the young wing scored 21 points for the Suns.  Though the team shot just over 41 percent from the field, they were able to compensate with stellar shooting from beyond the arc and at the free-throw line.  

Sacramento (19-31) left the game with a disappointing result, as the team needed a win to stay close to Denver for eighth in the Western Conference.  The team was narrowly edged out on Friday, despite shooting almost four percent better from the field than their opponent.  Even in the loss, center DeMarcus Cousins was able to make a considerable impact.  Cousins posted a triple-double, scoring 22 points and dishing 12 assists while pulling down 12 rebounds.  Off the bench, point guard Ty Lawson showed flashes of his former self, scoring 18 points in 28 minutes.

												The visiting Dallas Mavericks took down the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, 108-104.

Dallas (20-30) has picked up steam in recent weeks after what was an abysmal start to the season.  Friday's victory was marked by a breakout performance from D-League call-up Yogi Ferrell.  Ferrell, who shot an astounding 9-of-11 from three-point range, scored a career-high 32 points to lead the Mavericks including a game-clinching three-pointer with under 30 seconds remaining.  While Ferrell dropped jaws with his impressive play, wing Wesley Matthews also put together a stellar performance, scoring 27 points and coming away with six rebounds.  As a whole, the team earned the win on the backs of strong three-point shooting.   The Mavs shot an impressive 17-of-31 from beyond the arc.  

Portland (22-29), meanwhile, was let down by star point guard Damian Lillard.  Lillard shot just 4-of-20 on the night in quite possibly his worst outing of the season.  On the other hand, wing Evan Turner steped up for one of his best performances as a Blazer.  Turner scored 24 points on 10-of-17 shooting.  The Blazers held a rare advantage in the rebounding column, but were unable to shoot with nearly the efficiency of Dallas, ultimately ending in the loss.

The Blazers will visit OKC on Sunday, while the Mavericks will visit Denver on Monday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 116-108, at Verizon Center on Thursday. 

The Wizards (29-20) have been a dominant team at home all season, having secured 20 of the 28 victories they'd come in to Thursday with at Verizon Center. However, they may have gotten more than they initially bargained for against a feisty Lakers (17-35) squad that battled back from a 58-44 halftime deficit. John Wall ultimately proved too much for the visitors, though, posting a 33-point, 11-assist double-double that also included three rebounds, three steals and one block. Los Angeles was also done in by its inability to take care of the ball, as they committed a whopping 20 turnovers. 

The Lakers were led by a 20-point effort off the bench by Jordan Clarkson, which he complemented with two rebounds and an assist. D'Angelo Russell and Luol Deng posted matching 17-point tallies, with the former adding 11 assists, seven rebounds, two steals and a block, and the latter hauling in six boards and posting a block. Tarik Black managed a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included one assist. Lou Williams was productive in a reserve role as well, supplying 15 points, four assists, two rebounds and a block. 

Bradley Beal complemented Wall's effort with 23 points, four assists, a rebound, two steals and one block. Marcin Gortat submitted a 21-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included three assists and a steal. Markieff Morris also accomplished the feat, registering 12 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks. Otto Porter chipped in 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. 

The Lakers next head to Beantown to tangle with the Boston Celtics on Friday night, while the Wizards remain home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday evening.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Houston Rockets 113-108 Thursday at Toyota Center. 

With 8:30 left in the fourth quarter and the Rockets (36-17) up 20, the same seemed all but over, especially with both Paul Millsap and Dennis Schroeder on the bench and not looking to return for the Hawks (29-21). But then, from there, Houston stopped hitting their shots and Tim Hardaway Jr. refused to miss his. Hardaway went on to score 23 points in the final quarter, outscoring the Rockets 23-22 all by himself and willing the Hawks to a much-needed road victory. Hardaway finished with 33 points on 12-of-18 shooting from the field, and his performance ended up overshadowing the return to Houston for Dwight Howard, who put together his best performance of the season against his old team, recording 24 points and 23 rebounds in 37 minutes. 

For the Rockets, everything was going right for them through three quarters, and more importantly, everything was going right for James Harden, who had been going through a bit of a slump as of late. Harden finished with a game-high 41 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and four steals. Clint Capela also put together a nice game down low, scoring 22 points and grabbing nine boards in 31 minutes. Unfortunately for Houston, no lead was safe, and in the end, their poor shooting down the stretch cost them. The team ended up shooting just 37.6 percent from the field and 25.5 percent from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Hawks will head home Saturday to take on the Magic, while the Rockets will look to bounce back Friday against the Bulls.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 102-86, at AT&T Center on Thursday.

Philadelphis have been one of the worst teams in the league with Joel Embiid off the floor and that was the case yet again here. San Antonio really turned things on in the second half, outscoring Philadelphia, 54-33. Defense was key for the Spurs, as they held the Sixers to 34 percent from the field and forced them to commit 23 turnovers. Rebounding was a huge factor as well, with San Antonio winning that battle, 57-48.

The Sixers (38-11) had to play this game without Embiid and that's simply too big of a loss to overcome. Ersan Ilyasova carried the load in his absence, as he led the team with 25 points, 10 rebounds and four steals. Dario Saric was second on the team with 14 points and nine rebounds, but did commit seven turnovers in the defeat. Jahlil Okafor got the start for Embiid and totaled nine points, nine rebounds and three assists. 

The Spurs (18-31) were heavy favorites in this matchup and they didn't disappoint with this dominating win. Kawhi Leonard led the team in scoring, tallying 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Dewayne Dedmon started for LaMarcus Aldridge and recorded a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double.

												The visiting Golden State Warriors took down the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, 133-120.

The Warriors (43-7) saw stellar top-down play even despite the absence of All-Star Draymond Green.  The reigning conference Player of the Month duo, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, recorded a pair of double-doubles.  Curry led the team with 29 points and dished out 11 assists, while Durant scored 26 to go with 10 assists and eight rebounds.  It was a typically dominant game for the loaded superteam, as the Warriors shot over 52 percent from the field and poured in 14 three-pointers.  Seven players scored in double-digits and the team dished out a whopping 38 assists.  Golden State was able to quickly get ahead of the Clippers with a 33-22 advantage in the first quarter.

The Clippers (31-19) remain without injured superstar Chris Paul, and could have used him in Thursday's double-digit loss.  Star forward Blake Griffin took the reigns on offense in Paul's stead, scoring a game-high 31 points.  Off the bench, sixth man Jamal Crawford scored 21 and hit five three-pointers.  However, not even 50 percent shooting as a team and ten three-pointers was enough for LA to best the stacked Warriors' squad.  15 team turnovers did little to help the Clippers' case.  

The Warriors will travel to Sacramento on Saturday, while the Clippers will play in Boston on Sunday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Orlando Magic, 98-88, at Amway Center on Wednesday evening. 

The Pacers (26-22) typically rely on Paul George to spearhead their offensive attack, and more often than not, that approach provides very favorable returns. However, on occasions when the star forward isn't quite on his A-game, there are still plenty of other options for Indiana to fall back on. Such was the case Wednesday, with George shooting just 3-of-14 from the field, but the four other members of the starting five hitting double-digit scoring. Their contributions, along with those of Glenn Robinson and Al Jefferson off the bench, helped lead the Pacers to the double-digit road victory. Excellent defense also played a pivotal role, as Indiana held the Magic (19-32) to 40.3 percent shooting, including 25.8 percent from three-point range. 

C.J. Miles led the way with 16 points and four rebounds. Jeff Teague was next with 13 points, nine assists and a rebound. Thaddeus Young stepped up with 12 points, five rebounds, an assist and three steals. Myles Turner posted 11 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal. Robinson led the bench with 14 points and seven rebounds, while Jefferson provided a full stat line of 10 points, seven rebounds and three assists in just 16 minutes. 

The Magic were paced by Serge Ibaka's 20 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, an assist and two steals. Nicola Vucevic generated a 15-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included five assists and a pair of steals. Evan Fournier was next with 12 points, four assists, a rebound and two steals. Elfrid Payton registered 11 points, six rebounds and three assists. D.J. Augustin led the second unit with 10 points. 

The Pacers next head to New York to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Friday evening, while the Magic remain home and await the Toronto Raptors for a Friday night showdown as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 125-97, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday.

The Cavaliers and Timberwolves made a huge trade last season that sent Kevin Love to Cleveland and Andrew Wiggins to Minnesota, but nether player had much of an impact in this blowout Cavaliers win. Cleveland did most of their damage in the second half, outscoring Minnesota, 62-37. Rebounding and assists were a huge difference, with the Cavaliers winning both of those differentials by double-digit margins. Cleveland ended up shooting 54 percent from the field, while holding Minnesota to just 44 percent on their end. 

The Timberwolves (19-30) have been climbing back into the playoff hunt recently. but this was a tough task against a hungry Cavaliers team. Karl-Anthony Towns carried the load for Minnesota, as he tallied 26 points, 12 rebounds and four assists. Andrew Wiggins did score 23 points, but provided just two rebounds, no assists and zero defensive statistics in his revenge game. Ricky Rubio recorded a double-double, accruing 14 points and 13 assists. Shabazz Muhammad was the only other T'Wolf in double figures, dropping 16 points and six rebounds off the bench. The T'Wolves will be in Detroit on Friday to play the Pistons for their next game. 

The Cavaliers (33-15) had lost seven of their last 11 games headed into this matchup, so a blowout win is just what the doctor ordered. LeBron James was the player of the game, as he accumulated 27 points, eight rebounds and 12 assists. Kyrie Irving scored just 14 points, but matched that with a career-high 14 assists. Channing Frye started for Love and finished with 18 points and four rebounds. Tristan Thompson recorded an 18-point, 14-rebound double-double. Kyle Korver scored a season-high 20 points off the bench, on 8-of-11 shooting. Cleveland will play the New York Knicks on the road for their next game on Thursday.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Toronto Raptors, 109-104, at TD Garden on Wednesday. 

Despite the Raptors leading for the first 42 minutes of this game, the Celtics took the most important one to escape with a win. In fact, the five-point margin was Boston's biggest lead, as they held the lead for less than three total minutes. The fourth quarter was the difference, with the Celtics winning that quarter, 32-19. Despite dominating the shooting, the free-throw line really killed Toronto, as they shot 56 percent from the charity stripe, while Boston shot 83 percent. The assist-to-turnover differential was huge for Boston too, recording seven more assists than Toronto and committing six less turnovers. 

The Raptors (30-20) had to play this game without DeMar DeRozan (ankle), as it marked their seventh loss in their last nine games. Kyle Lowry carried the load, as he led the team with 32 points, two rebounds five assists and two steals. Norman Powell started for DeRozan and finished with 12 points, five rebounds and two assists. Jared Sullinger was second on the team in scoring, dropping 13 points and six rebounds off the bench. Toronto will play the Orlando Magic on the road for their next game on Friday. 

The Celtics (31-18) have rode Isaiah Thomas' ridiculous fourth quarter form all season and that was the recipe once again here. Thomas finished the game with 44 points and seven assists, with 19 of those coming in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder was second on the team, providing 14 points and eight rebounds. Al Horford scored just 11 points on 4-of-13 shooting, but grabbed three rebounds and handed out six assists. Marcus Smart was the only other Boston player in double figures, as he accumulated 10 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals off the bench. The Celtics next game is on Friday, as they host the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 95-90, at Barclay's Center on Wednesday. 

These are two New York teams that have struggled recently, but the Knicks were able to prevail with a big road win. A 29-14 run to end the game was the decisive stretch for New York, as Brooklyn led by 10 points early in the fourth quarter prior to that run. The biggest difference in the game for the Knicks was their feisty defense, as they swiped away 16 steals, while Brooklyn got just four. New York also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle, 58-49. The Nets dominated the shooting though, as they shot 42 percent, while holding the Knicks to just 35 percent from the field. 

The Knicks (22-29) are within three games of the eight-seed in the east and wins like this are crucial for that pursuit. Kristaps Porzingis led the team in scoring, as he provided 19 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. Carmelo Anthony was the only other starter in double figures, as he scored 15 points on 6-of-22 shooting. Strangely, Anthony did not play in the fourth quarter for an undisclosed reason. Willy Hernangomez was the most valuable Knicks player, as he totaled 16 points and 16 rebounds off the bench. 

The Nets (9-40) just continue to slide, as they've now lost 18 of their last 19 games. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson led Brooklyn in scoring, as he accumulated 16 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Bojan Bogdanovic was second on the team, collecting 15 points and seven rebounds. Trevor Booker was relegated to bench duties, but still provided 12 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Caris LeVert also played well off the bench, accruing 10 points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Charlotte Hornets 126-111 at Oracle Arena on Wednesday. 

The Splash Brothers, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, took care of business leading the Warriors (42-7) in a rout over the Hornets (23-27) at home. Golden State scored 77 points in the first half, and the Curry-Thompson combination each scored 26 points. Curry went on to knock down 11 three pointers, while Thompson added six of his own. The Hornets had no answer for the hot shooting back court, granted, getting into a shootout with the Warriors when they are on fire is never something that has worked out for opponents in Oracle Arena. 

Frank Kaminsky put together the best performance for the Hornets in his bench role, as he scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting, while Kemba Walker was silenced to just seven points in 25 minutes. Nicolas Batum was also held to a lowly 13 points, however, he did hit 3-of-4 from behind the arc. 

Curry went on to finish with a game high 39 points on 11-of-15 shooting from behind the arc. The reigning MVP added eight assists and five rebounds. Thompson scored 29 points and cooled off in the second half. Kevin Durant scored 18 points on 17 shots, but added eight assists and eight boards. 

Next up, the Warriors play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, while the Hornets visit the Jazz on Saturday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 116-93, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday.

The Heat (20-30) came in to the contest searching for their nine straight victory in what has been a jaw-dropping hot streak. Standing in their way was a Hawks (28-21) squad that may have still been feeling some of the residual fatigue from their quadruple-overtime classic against the New York Knicks on Sunday afternoon. Miami certainly seemed like the fresher team, jumping out to a 29-22 first quarter lead, and increasing that edge to 62-47 by intermission. Although matters tightened up somewhat in the second half, the Heat's cushion was too much for Atlanta to overcome. The home team played well on both ends of the floor, tallying a 48.9 percent success rate from the floor while limiting their visitors to a 39.1 percent figure. They also elicited 15 turnovers from the Hawks, while limiting their highest individual score to a modest 14 points.

Kent Bazemore mustered that total, and he supplemented it with an assist, two steals and a block. Dennis Schroder followed with 12 points, two assists, a rebound and a steal. Mike Dunleavy provided a bench-leading 11 points, which were accompanied by six rebounds. Tim Hardaway, Jr. supplied 10 points (on 2-of-9 shooting), four boards and a pair of assists. Paul Millsap, who'd played 60 minutes in Sunday's affair, totaled nine points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Dwight Howard went for just six points but hauled in 11 rebounds.

Dragic paced Miami with 27 points, five assists, five rebounds and a steal. Waiters was next with 20 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Hassan Whiteside put together an 18-point, 18-rebound double-double that also included one steal and two blocks. James Johnson chipped in with 16 points, three assists, two rebounds, three blocks and a steal. Tyler Johnson was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, five assists, three rebounds, two steals and two blocks. 

The Hawks get back on the road and head to Houston for a Thursday tilt with the Rockets, while the Heat are off until Saturday night when the Philadelphia 76ers come to town.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 118-98 Wednesday at the Palace in Auburn Hills. 

For the Pistons (22-27), Kentavious Caldwell-Pope put on a show, as the team got a much-needed victory after dropping their last three. Caldwell-Pope finished with a game-high 38 points on 12-of-18 shooting from the field and an incredible 8-of-11 from behind the arc. Andre Drummond's 17 points made him the only over Detroit player to score in double figures, with the Pistons' bench coming up huge in the winning effort. Led my Tobias Harris' 19 points and Ish Smith's 15, the bench ended up scoring a total of 48 points Wednesday. The win keeps the Pistons within striking distance of the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference standings, 

The Pelicans (19-31), on the other hand, did not benefit from a cast of contributors like their counterparts managed to. Anthony Davis led the way with 31 points and 12 rebounds, while Jrue Holiday had a double-double of his own with 22 points and 11 assists. Beyond that pairing, however, Terrence Jones was the the only one who was able to reach double-digit scoring with 11 points in 27 minutes. In fact, besides Davis and Holiday, who combined to shoot 56 percent from the field, the team shot a poor 18-of-41 (44 percent) from the field overall. 

Up next, the Pistons will remain home Friday to take on the Timberwolves, while the Pelicans will look to avoid losing their fourth straight game when they play the Wizards on Saturday.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 113-95 Wednesday at American Airlines Center. 

The Mavericks (19-30) steamrolled their way to a fourth straight victory as they continue to be much-improved since the start of the new year. They have now won five of their last six games and boast a 9-6 record in 2017. A major part of this run has been the play of Seth Curry, who scored a game-high 22 points Wednesday on top of six assists, four steals and three rebounds. It was his ninth game since the start of the new year with at least 15 points. The surprise performance of the night, however, came off the bench from Salah Mejri, who played just 21 minutes as a reserve but recorded 16 points and a game-high 17 rebounds in that time. Devin Harris also had a solid day off the bench, scoring 14 points in just 19 minutes. 

As for the 76ers (18-30), they've cooled off a bit since their hot start to January, as they have now lost three of their last four games after Wednesday's defeat. Jahlil Okafor put together a solid offensive performance in the loss, scoring 16 points in 24 minutes, but it's clear that Philadelphia is missing the inside presence of Joel Embiid, who has now missed five of the last six games with a knee contusion. Ersan Ilyasova added a double-double of 13 points and 10 rebounds, but overall for the 76ers, it was a forgettable night offensively. The team ended up shooting just 45.5 percent from the field and 27.3 percent from behind the arc while committing 21 total turnovers. 

Up next, the Mavericks will look to continue their winning ways against Portland on Friday, while the 76ers will travel Thursday to San Antonio.

The Grizzlies (30-21) continued to roll with yet another dominant victory, and they have now won three straight games on the road by a grand total of 46 points. Marc Gasol was once again tremendous in the winning effort, scoring an efficient 24 points in 24 minutes on top of five rebounds and three assists. Mike Conley added 18 points of his own, but it was the bench that really carried Memphis through the end of the game, with eight different reserves seeing the court Wednesday. Zach Randolph and Vince Carter each poured in 14 points as reserves, while James Ennis added 13 points, and the entire Grizzlies bench unit managed to produce 59 total points. In the end, with all 13 players, it was an offensive clinic for Memphis, who shot 47 percent from behind the arc and recorded 28 assists to just eight turnovers. 

As for the Nuggets (21-27), they've now dropped two straight games after rattling off three straight victories, as the absence of Nikola Jokic (hip) has really taken a tole on this team. His replacement, Jusuf Nurkic, scored just four points on 1-of-4 shooting and grabbed three rebounds in 19 minutes. The Nuggets did get some positive injury news, however, as Emanuel Mudiay (back) returned following a five-game absence, and while it was reported that he would be on a 20-minute restriction, Mudiay ended up playing 26 minutes and had a solid all-around game, recording 14 points, seven assists and six rebounds. As a team, however, it was a forgettable night for Denver, as they shot just 40 percent from the field and committed 17 turnovers. 

Up next, the Grizzlies will look to continue their hot streak in Oklahoma City on Friday against the Thunder, while the Nuggets will look to turn things around at home against the Bucks on Friday.

												The host Utah Jazz took down the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, 104-88.  

Utah (31-19) needed the win to bounce back from losing three of its previous four wins.  One of the main issues for the Jazz had been finding offense, and on Wednesday center and defensive anchor Rudy Gobert came through with a surprising amount of scoring potency.  Gobert shot 9-of-13 from the field and scored 26 points.  Newly-minted All-Star Gordon Hayward, meanwhile, came out of a bit of a January slump, scoring a team-high 27 points.  Utah's bread and butter as always, however, was its stellar defense.  The team held the Bucks to 43 percent from the field and only 88 points while forcing a massive 17 turnovers on the night.  

The Bucks (21-27) probably needed the win even more than the Jazz, as they have now lost nine of their last ten games.  On Wednesday, star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo was as good as absent from the game.  The ""Greek Freak"" shot just 2-of-10 for only nine points on the night.  Third-year forward Jabari Parker was one of the lone bright spots for the Bucks as they struggled to find offense.  Parker scored a team-high 17 points to go along with seven rebounds.  

The Bucks will visit Denver on Friday, while the Jazz will host the Hornets on Saturday.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers took down the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, 124-114.  

The Clippers (31-18) have had a rocky couple months after a hot start to the season.  Injuries first sidelined star forward Blake Griffin and soon after took out veteran superstar Chris Paul.  On Wednesday, Paul (thumb) remained out.  In his stead, the recently-returned Griffin led the offense, scoring a team-high 29 points and dishing out five assists.  The Clippers, with Griffin at the helm, seemingly couldn't miss from inside the arc.  The team shot over 52 percent from the field despite a dismal 5-of-19 from beyond the three-point line.  On the defensive end, center DeAndre Jordan delivered a big game, recording two steals and blocking four shots.  

The Suns (15-34), on the other hand, have struggled for the entire season.  Phoenix sits at last place in the Western Conference and 29th in the NBA overall.  On Wednesday, point guard Eric Bledsoe kept the team in the game almost single-handedly.  Bledsoe recorded his second 41-point game of the season, shooting a stellar 13-of-22 from the field and 13-of-15 from the free-throw line.  The young star also dished out a team-high eight assists.  Ultimately, Bledsoe was one of only a few Suns who managed to get his shots to fall on Wednesday.  The team hit just 41 percent of its shots on the night.

The Clippers host the Warriors on Thursday, while the Suns visit the Kings on Friday.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 128-100 at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday. 

The Bulls (25-25) pulled out an impressive victory on the road against the Thunder (28-22). Chicago found a sixth gear from the second quarter through the remainder of the matchup, dropping over 30 points per quarter and steadily building upon a halftime lead. Dwyane Wade, Nikola Mirotic and Jimmy Butler put together a strong trio, and midway through the third quarter, there was not much the Thunder could do to match the pace Chicago was playing at. 

Six Bulls players finished scoring in double figures, led by Butler's team high 28 points on 11-of-17 shooting. Butler added four rebounds, five assists and three steals across 30 minutes of action. Wade added 18 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in 24 minutes, while eight Chicago players came off the bench to provide some rest for the starters in the fourth quarter. 

Russell Westbrook had a quiet outing as compared to most of his campaign so far, as the Thunder point guard finished with 28 points, eight assists and five rebounds on 10-of-23 shooting in 29 minutes. Victor Oladipo aided Westbrook in double figures with 12 points, but the starters were simply not able to find a rhythm, especially the front court. Domantas Sabonis, Andre Roberson and Steven Adams combined for a lowly 15 points and 17 rebounds. 

Both teams play on Friday, as the Thunder host the Memphis Grizzlies, while the Bulls visit the Houston Rockets.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the New York Knicks, 117-101, at Verizon Center on Tuesday. 

The Knicks (21-29) checked in to Tuesday's game without two of their most important pieces, as Derrick Rose (ankle) and Kristaps Porzingis (illness) were unable to take the court. While Brandon Jennings and Willy Hernangomez both did admirable jobs filling in for the talented pair, New York was simply unable to overcome a highly balanced effort from the Wizards (28-20). All five members of the first unit managed double-digit scoring, and Washington posted a stellar 55.7 percent success rate from the floor. They were solid on the defensive end as well, limiting the visitors to 36.6 and 20.8 percent tallies from the field and three-point range, respectively.

New York was paced by Carmelo Anthony, who managed 26 points and five rebounds in the absence of his aforementioned teammates. Jennings supplied 21 points, five rebounds, two assists and four steals. Hernangomez posted a 15-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included four assists. Courtney Lee  mustered a modest five points on 2-of-10 shooting, along with five rebounds and one assist. Joakim Noah went scoreless over 15 minutes, contributing just four rebounds, an assist and a steal overall. Kyle O'Quinn made up for Noah's shortfall with a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double that led the second unit. 

Bradley Beal set the high-water mark on offense for the Wizards, registering 28 points on 12-of-18 shooting. He added four assists, two rebounds and a steal. Markieff Morris took advantage of Porzingis' absence to generate a 24-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists. Marcin Gortat accomplished the feat as well, posting 15 points, 10 rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. John Wall made it a double-double hat trick by going for 15 points, 13 assists and four rebounds. Otto Porter, Jr. filled out the stat sheet with 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and a steal.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 108-106, in overtime at Air Canada Center on Tuesday. 

In a game that was tight throughout, there were 11 ties and 19 lead changes in this overtime thriller. The difference for Toronto was the defensive rebounding, as they won that battle, 40-34. They also took advantage of scoring in the paint, with the Raptors recording 52 paint points to the Pelicans 44. The Raptors finished the game shooting 46 percent from the field, while New Orleans couldn't quite crack 43 percent shooting. 

The Pelicans (19-30) have just six road wins on the season and a tough loss like this will be hard to swallow. Anthony Davis did finish with 18 points and 17 rebounds, but shot just 4-of-18 from the field. Jrue Holiday was the Pelican's best player, as he dropped a team-high 30 points, to go along with three assists, two steals and two blocks. Buddy Hield finished with 15 points and six rebounds. E'Twaun Moore led the bench in scoring, providing 17 points and six rebounds. 

The Raptors (30-19) had to play this game without DeMar DeRozan, but they got a much needed win, after losing seven of their last eight. Kyle Lowry carried the load, as he tallied 33 points, four rebounds and 10 assists. Jonas Valanciunas was second on the team, as he totaled 20 points and 12 rebounds. Norman Powell started for DeRozan and accumulated 18 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Sacramento Kings 105-83 Tuesday at Toyota Center. 

This game was never close, as the Rockets (36-16) jumped out to an early lead and didn't think about giving it up. After what was a dominant second quarter, Houston held a 19 point lead heading into the locker room while the Kings (19-30), who were playing their eighth road game in 11 days, looked utterly defeated. Ryan Anderson put together one of his best performances of the season in the win, scoring a game-high 25 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in just 27 minutes. Eric Gordon shined off the bench, scoring 17 points on 7-of-15 shooting from the field. James Harden, on the other hand, struggled for the second straight game, scoring just 10 points on 3-of-9 shooting, but he did record eight assists and seven rebounds in 32 minutes.

For the Kings, it was a fairly uninspired performance, and it started with their star big man DeMarcus Cousins. Cousins shot just 5-of-16 from the field and recorded 16 points, seven rebounds and five assists in 25 minutes. Cousins' struggles were contagious, as the team overall shot just 35 percent from the field, 27.6 percent from behind the arc and a lowly 57.7 percent from the free throw line. The 83 points scored was the Kings's lowest total since mid-December, and they have now lost two of their last three games. 

Up next, the Rockets will remain home Thursday to take on the Hawks, while the Kings will finally return home Friday to play the Suns.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-94 Tuesday at AT&T Center.

The Spurs avoided suffering from their first three-game losing streak in almost a year in pretty dominant fashion, as they opened with a big opening period and adopted a bend-but-don't-break mentality the rest of the way. San Antonio was carried by a pair of stellar performances from their stars in the frontcourt, with Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge shining from start to finish. Leonard finished with a game-high 36 points on top of eight rebounds and four assists, while LaMarcus Aldridge shot 8-of-15 from the field en route to scoring 25 points and grabbing six rebounds of his own. With the pair accounting for over half of the Spurs' points Tuesday night, no other San Antonio players managed to score in double figures, but six managed to score at least six points. 

For the Thunder, they couldn't overcome a slow start to the game and one of their poorest shooting performances of the season. Overall as a team, Oklahoma City shot just 35.3 percent from the field and 25 percent from beyond the arc. Russell Westbrook managed to lead the way with a team-high 27 points on top of 14 assists and six rebounds, while the starting frontcourt of Steven Adams and Domantas Sabonis each recorded their own double-doubles, combining for 29 points and 22 rebounds. The Thunder have now dropped two straight against two of the NBA's best teams by a combined 30 points.

Up next, the Spurs will remain home Thursday to take on the 76ers, while the Thunder will head home Wednesday and play the Bulls.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers took down the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday, 115-98.

Portland (22-28) is now 4-1 in its last five games.  After a tough month of December, the Blazers have come back into form, with their only loss in the past two weeks coming by two points to the Golden State Warriors.  On Tuesday, Portland blew out the struggling Hornets on the backs of strong play from its guards and wings.  Star point guard Damian Lillard led the team with 27, while sixth man Allen Crabbe delivered 21 points off the bench.  Portland led tentatively in the first half but pulled away entirely thanks to a strong third quarter.  The Blazers surprisingly excelled on the boards on Tuesday, an area where the team has seen little success all season.  Portland held a 51-42 advantage in the rebounding column.  

Charlotte (23-26) has now lost five games in a row and is not in the position it hoped to be early in the season.  The Hornets have seen one of the season's more catastrophic slides, falling from a contender at the top of the East to a team battling for the eighth seed.  On Tuesday, All-Star point guard Kemba Walker dropped in 22 points to lead the team, but it was to no avail.  The Hornets shot a dismal 39 percent from the field as a unit and struggled  in most areas, including perimeter defense and rebounding.

The Hornets will visit Golden State on Wednesday, while Portland will play host to the Mavericks on Friday.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers beat the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, 120-116.

For the Lakers (16-34), three players scored at least 20 points en route to the high-offense win.  Most notably, sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell had one of his better games of the season, scoring 22 and dishing out 10 assists with only two turnovers.  Russell was just one of the bevvy of Lakers guards who had a strong showing on Tuesday.  Veteran Nick Young drained five three-pointers and scored a team-high 23 points.  Off the bench, sixth man Lou Williams scored another 21 for the Lakers while dishing another seven assists.  The Lakers were the beneficiaries of a cold Denver team, as the Nuggets shot just 41 percent and looked frozen in the third quarter.  

Denver (21-25), meanwhile, had some key absences on Tuesday.  Star center Nikola Jokic (hip) and point guard Emmanuel Mudiay (hamstring) both missed the contest.  Jokic's absence meant no shortage of rebounds for forward Kenneth Faried, who gobbled up 17 boards to lead the team.  Thanks in large part to Faried's effort, the Nuggets established a 51-44 advantage on the offensive glass.  With Jokic out, however, the Nuggets saw some lackluster offense, particularly during stretches in the second half.  The team shot only 41 percent, despite knocking down 15-of-27 from beyond the three-point line.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Sacramento Kings, 122-119, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday evening. 

The Kings (19-29) got off to a fast start, jumping on the Sixers (18-29) early and building a 35-21 lead after one quarter. Even without superstar Joel Embiid, the Sixers battled back, closing the gap to 55-48 by halftime. They gained the separation they needed in the third quarter, scoring an impressive 42 points during the period. A balanced offensive effort was key to overcoming another monster effort from the Kings' DeMarcus Cousins, as seven Philadelphia players managed double-digit scoring, and the Sixers tallied a 54.2 percent success rate overall from the field. Meanwhile, they also elicited 20 turnovers from Sacramento, which proved pivotal in their comeback.

Cousins posted an eye-popping 46-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included five assists, one steal and one block. However, the big man also committed eight of the aforementioned 20 turnovers. The only other two double-digit scoring efforts came from the bench, as Willie Cauley-Stein went for 17 points, three rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block to lead the second unit, and Matt Barnes, whose three-point jumper brought Sacramento within 120-119 with five seconds remaining, tallied 16 points, three rebounds, two assists and one steal. Darren Collison and Arron Afflalo put forth a pair of eight-point efforts, with the former adding two assists and one steal, and the latter providing four rebounds and three assists. Garrett Temple (seven points, five assists, one rebound, two steals) and Kosta Koufos (six points) rounded out the starting five.

The Sixers were led by Robert Covington's 23 points, which he supplemented with 10 rebounds, two assists and four steals. Dario Saric was next with a bench-leading 17 points, along with six assists and five rebounds. Nik Stauskas posted 16 points, one assist, one steal and one block. Jahlil Okafor started at center and registered 15 points, four rebounds and two assists. Henderson submitted 15 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals off the bench, while Nerlens Noel had 12 points, three rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block as a member of the second unit as well. Ersan Ilyasova scored 10 points, two rebounds, one assist and one steal.

The Kings travel to Houston to take on the Rockets on Tuesday evening, while the Sixers also head to the Lone Star State to take on the Mavericks on Wednesday night.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 104-96, at American Airlines Arena on Monday. 

The recent form of these teams would indicate a Miami blowout, but that simply wasn't the case in this close-fought battle. A 32-11 run spanning between the second and third quarter was the decisive stretch, as that swung a double-digit lead for the Nets into a 10-point lead for the Heat. Despite there being just three ties and three lead changes, neither team led by more than 13 points, as it was a single-digit margin for well over 40 minutes. Three-point shooting was the difference in the game, with Miami going 11-of-26 from long range, while Brooklyn went just 4-of-26. The assist-to-turnover ratio killed Brooklyn as well, as they committed five more turnovers than Miami, while recording six less assists. 

The Nets (9-39) have just one win in their last 18 games, but this was a valiant effort against a hot Miami team. Bojan Bogdanovic led Brooklyn in scoring, totaling 16 points and six rebounds, Brook Lopez was second on the team, finishing with 14 points, three rebounds and three assists on 5-of-17 shooting. Trevor Booker amassed 13 points and eight rebounds. Isaiah Whitehead was the only bench player in double figures, providing 13 points, four rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes of action. Brooklyn will look to get out of this slide on Wednesday, when they host the New York Knicks for their next game.

The Heat (19-30) have now won eight-straight games, as they continue to climb back into the playoff hunt. Goran Dragic scored a game-high 20 points, to go along with three rebounds, eight assists and three steals. Dion Waiters wasn't far behind, tallying 19 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Hassan Whiteside recorded 12 points, nine rebounds and three blocks. James Johnson was arguably the player of the game off the bench, accumulating 17 points, four rebounds, five assists, two steals and three blocks. On deck for the heat is a home matchup against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Orlando Magic, 111-105, in overtime Monday at Target Center.

The Timberwolves (19-29), now winners of five of their last six, actually found themselves down for most of Monday's game before opening up a lead in the fourth quarter as large as nine points. The Magic (19-31) managed to storm back, however, closing the gap and even taking the lead with under a minute remaining. But Andrew Wiggins wouldn't let the game end there, as his 21-foot jumper with 10 seconds remaining ultimately sent the game into overtime. At that point, there was no stopping Minnesota as they pulled away in the five-minute period. Wiggins finished the outing with a game-high 27 points, while Karl Anthony-Towns added yet another double-double of 23 points and 12 rebounds on top of seven assists. Ricky Rubio came close to a triple-double of his own, recording 22 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. 

As for the Magic, they put together a valiant effort just one night removed from upsetting the Toronto Raptors. And it was an all-around team effort Monday night, as all five starts and six total Orlando players managed to score in double figures. It was the starting backcourt, however, that led the way, with Elfrid Payton recording a team-high 21 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals, while C.J. Watson scored 18 points of his own. In the end, the Magic just left too many points at the free throw line, hitting just 13-of-19 shot from the charity stripe for the game, which ended up being the difference.

Up next, the Timberwolves will head to Cleveland on Wednesday to take on the Cavaliers, while the Magic will head home Wednesday and play the Pacers.

												The Boston Celtics took down the visiting Detroit Pistons at TD Garden on Monday, 113-109.

Boston (30-18) has now won four straight games despite the absence of starting shooting guard Avery Bradley.  The Celtics have quickly climbed the Eastern Conference standings and now sit a game ahead of the Raptors for second place in the East.  Much of the team's success has been due to the incredible play of point guard Isaiah Thomas.  The two-time All-Star is closing in on Russell Westbrook for the scoring title, gradually increasing his averages with performances like Monday's 41-point explosion. Thomas scored 24 of his points in the fourth quarter, a trend he has firmly established throughout the season.  The 5'9 superstar leads the league in fourth quarter scoring at over 10 points per night.  Part of his success on Monday was due to his strength at the free-throw line, where he shot a perfect 15-of-15.  He added a stellar eight assists.  

The Celtics also saw strong play from veteran All-Star Al Horford.  Horford had missed the previous two games with a groin injury but looked in fine form on Monday, scoring 13 points to go with six rebounds, six assists, and a pair of blocks on Detroit's Andre Drummond.  Forward Jae Crowder, meanwhile, scored 21 points while knocking down four three-pointers.  Three-pointers gave the edge to Boston despite a rebounding and fast-break deficit, as the team made 13 threes while holding Detroit to only three.

For Detroit (21-27), center Andre Drummond had a monster game.  Drummond led the team with 28 points and pulled down a whopping 22 rebounds.  He acted as the clear leader of the team, with point guard Reggie Jackson experiencing struggles while on the floor.  Despite saying that matching up against a top-tier point guard like Thomas would act as inspiration for his performance, Jackson shot just 4-of-12 from the field and fouled out in 28 minutes of play.  Bench point guard Ish Smith, however, did not have the same struggles.  Smith shot 6-of-7 from the field and had a pair of blocks, including one on Isaiah Thomas that led to a clutch fast-break bucket.

												The host Dallas Mavericks beat the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday, 104-97.

Dallas (18-30) is now 7-4 in its last 11 games, and is coming off its best two-game stretch of the season.  The Mavs were able to take down two of the league's top three teams on consecutive days, following a win over the Spurs by taking down the reigning champion Cavaliers.  With Cleveland missing Kevin Love, the Mavericks were able to force the Cavs to rely extremely heavily on Kyrie Irving and LeBron James.  Dallas, meanwhile, took a more balanced approach.  Five Mavericks took at least 11 shot attempts, and all five scored in double figures.  Forward Harrison Barnes led the team with 24 points and 11 rebounds.

Cleveland (32-15) is floundering in the new year, having now dropped to three games under .500 in 2017.  The team now holds only a 2.5 game lead on the first seed in the Eastern Conference.  Superstar LeBron James characteristically put his work in on Monday, scoring 23 points to go with nine rebounds and nine assists.  Kyrie Irving, meanwhile, shot only 7-of-21 for 18 points and dished out just five assists on the night.  The Cavs struggled again with ball movement, recording only 17 team assists in the game.  

Cleveland will host the Timberwolves on Wednesday, while Dallas will host Philadelphia.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Phoenix Suns, 115-96, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Monday. 

Mike Conley was lethal from behind the arc en route to one of his finest performances of the season, as his 38 points were more than enough to lead the Grizzlies (29-21) to a rout of the Suns (15-33) on the road. Memphis went into the half with an 11-point lead, and built that into a 20-point blowout by midway through the third quarter, where Conley sank all three free throws that came on a foul behind the three point line. First-round pick Marquese Chriss had a solid outing for the Suns in the loss, going 8-of-12 from the field on his way to 20 points and six boards. 

Conley's big night was aided by nine assists and six rebounds, in addition to the 7-of-10 three point shooting and 12-of-18 total from the field. Marc Gasol was efficient in his 18 points, which came on 12 shots, however, the big man has cooled off considerably following a stretch of 30-plus point performances. Zach Randolph led the bench with 18 points, while the Grizzlies shot a remarkable 57.1 percent from three-point land. 

Phoenix got two 20-plus point performances from Devin Booker and Chriss, but the scoring was far from efficient, which has been a trend for most opponents of Memphis this season, given their strength on the defensive end of the floor. Memphis stole the ball 13 times from the Suns, and had no problem putting the Suns on the charity stripe given their comfortable lead early in the second half. 

Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Suns host the Los Angeles Clippers, while the Grizzlies visit the Denver Nuggets.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the New York Knicks in quadruple overtime, 142-139, at Phillips Arena on Sunday. 

A game that started off with very little defense being played over the first two quarters ended up becoming much tighter over the third and fourth periods. After the Knicks (21-28) held a 65-61 lead going into halftime, the two teams combined for just 84 points in the second half. With four overtimes, there were plenty of opportunities for heroics, and Carmelo Anthony and Courtney Lee capitalized on three of them. Anthony's driving layup with two seconds left in regulation and 18-footer with six ticks in the first overtime helped New York stay alive, while Lee's 26-foot three-point jumper with one second on the clock in the second overtime sent matters into a third extra period. Dennis Schroder then turned the tables, draining a driving layup with three seconds remaining in the third overtime. Finally, it was Paul Millsap who put an end to the Knicks' first four-overtime tilt since 1951, pouring in a shot with 27 seconds remaining that gave Atlanta (28-20) a 141-139 lead they wouldn't relinquish. In all, four Knicks players, including Anthony, fouled out, while Millsap played a whopping 60 minutes.

Anthony led the way for New York with a season-high 45 points, along with six rebounds, four assists and one block over 46 minutes, taking a whopping 36 shots in the process. Brandon Jennings, starting for Derrick Rose (ankle), totaled 18 points, 11 assists, three rebounds and one steal. Lee had a near double-double with 17 points, nine rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block. Kristaps Porzingis managed 15 points, five boards, one assist and three blocks. Justin Holiday stepped up with a bench-leading 15 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists and one steal. Mindaugas Kuzminskas posted 13 points, four rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block in a reserve role as well. Kyle O'Quinn hauled in 12 boards off the bench, and Joakim Noah had a modest six points but added 14 rebounds, five assists, three steals and two blocks.

Millsap paced Atlanta with a 37-point, 19-rebound double-double that also included seven assists, one steal and one block. Kent Bazemore managed 24 points and nine rebounds. Schroder posted a 23-point, 15-assist double-double that also included four rebounds, while Dwight Howard posted a 19-point, 13-rebound effort of his own. Tim Hardaway, Jr. matched Howard's point total while dishing out eight assists, hauling in five rebounds and recording a steal. Mike Dunleavy led the reserves with 12 points.

The Knicks get a day off to rest before facing the Washington Wizards in the Nation's Capital on Tuesday evening, while the Hawks travel to South Florida to face the Heat on Wednesday night.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 107-91, at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday.

The Cavaliers (32-14) came in to Sunday's contest badly in need for a convincing victory against a quality opponent, as they'd lost six of their last nine games, and had struggled to put away a significantly short-handed Brooklyn Nets squad until the fourth quarter on Friday. Things didn't seem to exactly be pointing in the right direction early on Sunday, as Kevin Love was forced from the game after 12 minutes with back spasms. The Thunder (28-20) also held a 24-21 lead after one quarter, but LeBron James and Kyrie Irving turned things up a notch during the second period. Cleveland outscore OKC by a 37-21 margin over that span, building 58-45 lead heading into halftime. Tristan Thompson and Iman Shumpert also turned in outstanding supporting efforts in the win, and the Cavs managed to hold their visitors to 37.0 percent shooting from the field, and a 23.1 percent success rate from three-point range.

Russell Westbrook did manage to record yet another triple-double, but was ""contained' to a manageable 20 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, one steal and one block, shooting just 7-of-26 from the field. Victor Oladipo didn't fare much better, posting 17 points (on 6-of-18 shooting), seven boards and four assists. Domantas Sabonis provided 12 points and five rebounds. Steven Adams tallied seven points but also hauled in 10 boards, along with one assist and one block. Joffrey Lauvergne led the bench with 13 points, six rebounds and one assist.

Irving paced Cleveland with 29 points, 10 assists, three rebounds and one steal.  James supplied 25 points, 14 boards, eight assists and one steal. Thompson contributed a 19-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included one assist, four steals and four blocks. Reggie Jefferson led the second unit with eight points, four rebounds and one steal.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Houston Rockets, 120-101, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday.

Indiana got out to a hot start early and they never looked back after that. In fact, the Pacers led by 13 after the first quarter, as they never relinquished the lead from there. Defense was key for Indiana, as they held Houston to 41 percent from the field (34-of-83) and 28 percent from three-point range (11-of-39). The Rockets were killed in the assist-to-turnover ratio, with Houston committing 15 turnovers to 21 assists, while the Pacers handed out 28 assists to 10 turnovers. Despite the Pacers shooting just 5-of-21 from three point range, they finished the game 47-of-87 from the field.

The Rockets (35-16) had to play this game in the second half of a back-to-back set and they were clearly tired in this loss. Ryan Anderson led the team in scoring, as he dropped 27 points to go along with seven boards. James Harden accumulated 15 points, five rebounds and eight assists, but committed eight turnovers and shot 3-of-17 from the field. Eric Gordon led the bench in scoring, providing 14 points and three assists. On deck for Houston is a home matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.

The Pacers (25-22) are now 18-6 at home, as they continue to thrive in Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Paul George was the player of the game, as he accrued 33 points, nine rebounds and three assists. Myles Turner was second on the team, totaling 18 points, 10 rebounds, three steals and four blocks. Jeff Teague amassed 17 points and 13 assists as the starting point guard. Glenn Robinson III and Lavoy Allen combined for 24 points and eight rebounds on 11-of-13 shooting off the bench. The Pacers will look to keep rolling on Wednesday against the Orlando Magic.

												The visiting Washington Wizards took down the host New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, 107-94.

Washington (27-20) has now won eight of its last nine games.  On Sunday, the convincing win was due in large part to strong play from All-Star point guard John Wall.  Wall recorded 18 points and 19 assists while at the helm of the strong Wizards offense.  Washington was able to stave off a comeback attempt from New Orleans early in the second half with a strong fourth quarter.  All five Wizards starters scored in double figures, and the starting five accounted for 96 of Washington's points.  The team finished shooting over 50 percent from the field with ten three-pointers.

New Orleans (19-29) has had a bumpy season thus far, trading off wins and losses fairly consistently after a rough 1-9 start.  On Sunday, the Pelicans were the Anthony Davis show, as the superstar led the team with 36 points and 17 rebounds.  Three steals and two blocks rounded out what was a typically monstrous night for the 23-year-old big man.  Bench struggles were a problem for the Pelicans on Sunday, as the second unit shot only 36 percent on the night.  Overall, the Pels' 45 percent shooting was not enough to overcome a very strong night for the Wizards on the offensive end.  

The Pelicans will visit Toronto on Tuesday, while Washington will host the Knicks on Monday.

												The visiting Orlando Magic took down the host Toronto Raptors on Sunday, 114-113.

Orlando (19-30) bounced back from a 30-point blowout loss at the hands of the Celtics for the win in Toronto on Sunday.  Big man Nikola Vucevic led the team with 25 points and 10 rebounds against Toronto.  Despite trailing early in the game, the Magic were able to come back and hold on to a lead for the entirety of the second.  Orlando finished the first half on a 20-2 run, with Toronto making no field goals during the stretch.  Point guard Elfrid Payton played a major piece in the Orlando offense, recording a double-double with 11 points and 10 assists.  The Magic were red hot on Sunday, hitting over 53 percent of their shots from the field and making 10 three-pointers.

Toronto (29-19) has struggled mightily of late, losing six of its last seven games.  The Raptors, once solidly holding second place in the East, have slipped to third behind Cleveland and Boston in the standings.  On Sunday, the clock was Toronto's greatest enemy, as the Raptors came to within one point of the win after trailing by 11 with two minutes left to play.  Recently injured star DeMar DeRozan came back but looked rusty, as he shot just 6-of-18 on the night.  All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry, however, led the team with an efficient 33 points and eight assists.

Toronto will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, while the Magic will visit the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 121-108, at United Center on Sunday.

Despite Philadelphia leading for the first six minutes, Chicago took control from there. In fact, the Bulls finished the first quarter on a 32-12 run and never relinquished the lead from there. Bench production was huge for the Bulls, as they outscored the Sixers bench, 49-15. Three-point shooting was a decisive statistic as well, with Philly going 10-of-28 from long range, while Chicago went 8-of-14. The Bulls also took advantage of the whistle. taking twice as many free-throws as the Sixers, while shooting a better percentage. 

The Sixers (17-29) had to play this game without Joel Embiid (rest) and they simply couldn't overcome his absence. Ersan Ilyasova led the team in scoring, totaling 31 points and 11 rebounds in the defeat. Robert Covington was second on the team, amassing 21 points, 12 rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks. T.J. McConnell also recorded a double-double, scoring 14 points to go along with three rebounds and 12 assists. Nerlens Noel started for Embiid and finished with 12 points, six rebounds, two steals and three blocks. The six bench players combined for just 15 points. 

The Bulls (24-25) have had a lot of issues on and off the court recently, but dominating wins like this show just how good they can be. Jimmy Butler bounced back from his benching to lead the team with 28 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and four steals. Robin Lopez was second on the team, collecting 21 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. Dwyane Wade accumulated 14 points, six rebounds and six assists. Paul Zipser, Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic all finished between 13 and 14 points off the bench.

												The visiting Dallas Mavericks took down the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday, 105-101.

Dallas (17-30) has struggled for much of the season but surprised many by beating one of the league's top teams on Sunday.  Point guard Seth Curry helped to lead the charge for the Mavericks, scoring a team-high 24 points and pulling down 10 rebounds.  Curry also dished out five assists.  The Mavericks protected the ball exceptionally well against the tough San Antonio defense, committing only six turnovers on the night.  Veteran superstar Dirk Nowitzki also contributed heavily to the win over his classic rival, scoring 15 points and pulling down 10 rebounds.

For San Antonio (36-11), the loss came as a bit of a surprise.  Despite holding the second-best record in the league, the Spurs have now dropped two straight contests.  Superstar forward Kawhi Leonard led the team with 24 points and pulled down seven rebounds, and helped to keep the Spurs close despite the loss.  San Antonio was unable to play a neat game, however, committing 11 turnovers to Dallas's five and hitting just 65 percent of its free-throws.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 113-111 at Moda Center on Sunday. 

The Warriors (41-7) came away with a road win even without reigning MVP Stephen Curry (illness) for the first time this season. The Blazers (21-28) pulled off a wild 20-2 run to close out the first half, bringing the game within striking distance, as the back-and-forth ensued for the second half. Evan Turner proved his worth on the defensive end and caused problems for the Golden State back court throughout the game. Turner also dunked home the transition layup to cut the Warriors lead to just two points with under :10 remaining in the fourth quarter. Durant was called for an offensive foul on the following inbound pass, and Turner missed the game winning three as time expired. 

Durant went on to lead all scorers with 33 points, to go along with 10 rebounds, six assists, one block and seven turnovers on 13-of-26 shooting. Thompson was fed most of his shots on off-ball screens where he was dominant around the perimeter in the second half and made his way to the foul line for additional damage. The Warriors all-star shooting guard finished with 27 points on 6-of-21 shooting, which included 13-of-15 from the charity stripe. 

McCollum continued his strong scoring streak and finished with 28 points, which led all Blazers scorers, on 10-of-16 shooting, while Lillard scored 19 points alongside eight assists in 36 minutes. Neither team shot well behind the three point line, rare for two squads who utilize the three-point line for much of their scoring and game plan, as both fell below 40 percent. 

Next up, the Blazers host the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday, while the Warriors host the Hornets on the second game of a back-to-back for Kemba Walker's team.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 109-106, at Spectrum Center on Saturday.

DeMarcus Cousins is always the centerpiece of the Sacramento offense due to his immense talent. However, any time that a fellow member of the starting five goes down, the mercurial big man's importance and usage rate both tend to go through the roof. Such has been the case in the wake of the loss of Rudy Gay for the season to an Achilles injury, and the most recent example came Saturday as the Kings (19-28) handed the Hornets (23-25) their fourth straight loss. Cousins led the way with a massive 35-point, 18-rebound double-double and made two pivotal plays in the closing seconds. He netted a driving layup with 14.3 seconds left to give the Kings the lead, and then drained a free throw for the final margin of victory.

Cousins added four assists and a block to his aforementioned numbers. Darren Collison was a distant second with 17 points, two assists and a block. Anthony Tolliver posted a bench-leading 14 points that he supplemented with seven boards, three assists, two steals and a block. Arron Afflalo provided 13 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal. Willie Cauley-Stein totaled 13 points and three rebounds in a reserve role as well.

The Hornets were led by Kemba Walker, who went for 26 points, seven assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Nicolas Batum provided 19 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Marvin Williams posted 14 points, two rebounds and an assist. Spencer Hawes led the bench with 12 points, seven boards, an assist and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist managed a full stat line of nine points, six rebounds, four blocks and a steal. Frank Kaminsky III was also productive as a reserve, registering eight points, six assists, four rebounds and a block.

The Kings head to Philadelphia to take on the Sixers for a Monday night showdown, while the Hornets head west to Portland to take on the Trail Blazers.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Detroit Pistons, 116-103, at Palace at American Airlines Arena on Saturday evening.

The Heat (18-30) checked in to Saturday in the midst of their best stretch of the season, but faced a Pistons (21-26) squad that was surging in its own right, albeit a bit more modestly. Although Detroit was hot from the field -- as evidenced by a 56.6 percent success rate -- Miami countered by going 53.2 percent from the floor and 50.0 percent from three-point range. Four Heat players drained multiple threes, and seven players shot 50 percent or better. The spectacular offensive performances allowed the home team to pull away in the fourth quarter after they entered the period with a 91-90 deficit.

Reggie Jackson paced the Pistons with 24 points, seven boards and three assists. Andre Drummond had his typically spectacular game against the Heat, generating 17 points, 20 rebounds, an assist, three steals and two blocks. Tobias Harris supplied a bench-leading 16 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds and a steal. Marcus Morris provided 14 points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal. Jon Leuer and Ish Smith registered matching eight-point efforts from the first unit and bench, respectively.

Goran Dragic led the way for Miami with 23 points, a total he supplemented with four assists, two rebounds and a steal. Wayne Ellington led the bench with 19 points, two assists and a steal. James Johnson continued his strong play with 18 points, eight boards, five assists, two steals and a block. Dion Waiters tallied 17 points, seven assists and three boards. Hassan Whiteside contributed a modest nine points but hauled in 12 boards. 

The Pistons next head to Boston to face off with the Celtics on Monday evening, while the Heat remain home to tangle with the Nets on Monday night as well.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 112-108, in overtime at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Saturday. 

Despite Boston leading for 52 of the 53 minutes of this game, it was tight throughout. In fact, there were five ties, as it was a single-digit margin for the final 25 minutes. The first quarter was the difference in the game, as the Celtics won that quarter, 42-27. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with Boston recording three more assists and two less turnovers than Milwaukee. The Celtics starters put it to the Bucks starters, outscoring them, 77-55.

The Celtics (29-18) were hanging on to a small lead all game, but they were able to prevail with a huge road win. Isaiah Thomas was once again the star, as he tallied 37 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Jae Crowder was second on the team, as he accrued 20 points, six rebounds and four assists. Kelly Olynyk was huge off the bench, as he dropped 17 points to go along with seven rebounds and three assists. Jaylen Brown and Amir Johnson did a nice job of filling-in for Al Horford, as they combined for 20 points and 15 rebounds. Boston will host the Detroit Pistons on Monday for their next game.

The Bucks (21-26) have now lost eight of their last nine games, as the growing pains for this young team hurt as much as ever. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the team in scoring, as he accumulated 21 points, six rebounds and six assists. Matthew Dellavedova was second among starters, as he amassed 14 points, three rebounds and six assists. Greg Monroe recorded a double-double off the bench, totaling 14 points, 13 rebounds, three steals and three blocks. Michael Beasley led the bench in scoring, providing 17 points and eight rebounds. The Bucks will be off until Tuesday, when they play the Utah Jazz on the road for their next game.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 144-98, at Oracle Arena on Saturday. 

There aren't many NBA games that are as lopsided as this one, but that's just how good the Warriors can be. Not only did they lead by 21 at the half, they took a 44-point lead into the fourth quarter. The shooting was incredible, as they went 57-of-92 from the field and 17-of-34 from three-point range. Rebounding was a huge difference as well, with Golden State winning that battle, 47-32. The Warriors also handed out 35 assists on their 57 made baskets.

The Clippers (30-18) had to play this game without Chris Paul, but not even his elite defense could have done anything about this onslaught. Blake Griffin did all he could for Los Angeles, as he led the team with 20 points, four rebounds and two assists, Austin Rivers played 37 minutes and accumulated 10 points, two rebounds and six assists. Raymond Felton played well off the bench, totaling 10 points, seven rebounds and five assists. The Clippers will be off until Wednesday, when they play the Phoenix Suns on the road for their next game. 

The Warriors (40-7) have the best offensive numbers in the league, but this performance may have been their best of the season. Stephen Curry was unconscious, as he tallied 43 points, nine rebounds and six assists in three quarters of action. Kevin Durant was second on the team, as he accrued 23 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Klay Thompson was the only other starter in double figures, as he dropped 16 points. Those three players combined to go 31-of-45 from the field. Andre Iguodala had a nice game off the bench, providing nine points, six rebounds and five assists. Golden State will play the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday for their next game in the second half of a back-to-back set.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Utah Jazz, 102-95, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday.

In a battle between two of the best defenses in the NBA, this game was tight throughout. Despite there being just two ties and seven lead changes, neither team led by more than 12 points. The Grizzlies did their most damage in the second quarter, winning that quarter, 26-16. Memphis had one of their best shooting games of the season, hitting 51 percent from the field, 90 percent from the free-throw line and 42 percent from three-point range. The turnover differential was big for the Grizzlies, as they won that battle, 13-7.

The Grizzlies (28-20) have struggled on offense all season long, but a 102-point outing against the Utah Jazz is just what the doctor ordered. Zach Randolph was the catalyst, as he scored a season-high 28 points off the bench, while also grabbing nine boards. Mike Conley led the starters in scoring, tallying 23 points, three rebounds and three assists. Marc Gasol was the only other Memphis player in double figures, as he accumulated 18 points, four rebounds and five assists. The Grizzlies will be on the road for their next game on Monday against the Phoenix Suns.

The Jazz (30-19) did have five players score at least 14 points, but the other five players combined for just 15 points in total. Rodney Hood led the team in scoring, as he dropped 20 points, with very little else to his name. Gordon Hayward went just 4-of-13 from the field, but accrued 14 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Rudy Gobert totaled 15 points and nine rebounds, while George Hill collected 16 points, three rebounds and five assists. Alec Burks led the bench in scoring, dropping 15 points on 4-of-5 from the field. Utah will return to action on Tuesday in a home matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Phoenix Suns 123-112, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Saturday evening. 

Eric Bledsoe went off for a career-high 41 points but it was not enough to hold off the Nuggets. Denver dominated the middle two quarters, outscoring the Suns 74-50 over the second and third quarters.

Danilo Gallinari led the way with 32 points to help the Nuggets (21-25) earn their third straight win and hold on to eighth place in the West. Four other players scored in double digits for the Nuggets, including Kenneth Faried, who finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds, in 37 minutes. The rookie Jamal Murray came up big with 18 points off the bench, to give a boost, as Nikola Jokic (hip), Denver's main weapon was sidelined. The Nuggets hit a whopping 37-of-42 free throws, which was really the difference in this one, even though the Suns took their fair share as well, hitting 24-of-32. The Nuggets go on to visit the Lakers on Tuesday. 

Despite 41 points from Bledsoe, the Suns (15-32) were not able to keep up with the high-scoring Nuggets. Three other players scored in double digits for Phoenix, including Devin Booker, who followed up with 23 points, and Tyson Chandler, who double-doubled with 15 points and 13 rebounds. The Suns outscored the Nuggets 21-11 in fast-break points, and had four less turnovers, but committed 11 more personal fouls, which gave the Nugs a huge advantage at the foul line. The Suns go on to host the Grizzlies on Monday.											",Phoenix,Suns,Denver,Nuggets,Talking Stick Resort Arena,21,25,15,32,6.0,21.0,41.0,91.0,24.0,32.0,43.0,20.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,T.J.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the visiting Brooklyn Nets, 129-109 at Target Center on Saturday evening. 

Karl-Anthony Towns imposed his will on this one, as he poured in a game-high 37 points to help the Timberwolves dominate, as they won every quarter on their way to the 20-point win over the struggling Nets. 

The Timberwolves (18-29) shot 51.1 percent from the field, as all five starters scored in double digits to lead the way. Karl-Anthony Towns grabbed 13 rebounds and recorded four blocked shots, to go along with his game-high 37 points. Andrew Wiggins followed up with 23 points, while Zach LaVine chipped in 20. Shabazz Muhammad came up big off the bench for Minnesota, as he finished with 18 points and seven rebounds. The Timberwolves will look to keep rolling, as they play host to the Magic on Monday. 

The Nets (9-38) outscored the T-Wolves 58-48 in the paint and 23-12 in fast-break points but were not able to compete as efficiently, as they shot 48.2 percent from the field, and 33.3 percent from deep, compared to the 45 percent the T-Wolves hit from deep. Brook Lopez was the high-point man for the Nets, with 25 points, to go along with seven rebounds. Three other players scored in double digits for Brooklyn, including Sean Kilpatrick, who added 14 points, in 25 minutes off the bench. The Nets will look to bounce back, as they visit Miami on Monday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Sacramento Kings in overtime, 115-111, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday evening.

The Kings (18-27) came in to Friday with an unsightly record overall, but also riding high off a shocking 116-112 overtime win against the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. They faced another All-Star small forward Friday in the Pacers' Paul George, and he would ultimately prove to be pivotal to their undoing. First, his two free throws with 1:16 remaining in regulation knotted the score at 104. While he did miss two jumpers before the end of the fourth quarter that could have potentially won the game for Indiana, he made up for it in overtime with six of the Pacers' 11 points, including a go-ahead jumper with 35 seconds remaining. Although Sacramento posted superb 49.3-and-50.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, they turned the ball over a whopping 19 times, contributing to their defeat.

DeMarcus Cousins and Darren Collison led the Kings with matching 26-point efforts, with the former adding 16 boards, five assists and one block, and the latter dishing out five dimes, hauling in four boards and recording three steals. Arron Affalo turned in 15 points and a rebound. Kosta Koufos supplied nine points but hauled in 12 boards. Ty Lawson led the bench with 16 points, six assists, two rebounds and a steal. Anthony Tolliver was productive in a reserve role as well with 10 points and five rebounds. 

George's 33 points led the Pacers, a total he supplemented with four rebounds, three assists and two steals. C.J. Miles drew a start and registered 18 points, two rebounds, an assist and a steal. Jeff Teague tallied a full stat line of 17 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and a steal. Myles Turner managed 14 points, four assists, two rebounds, three steals and a block. Thaddeus Young collected eight points, five rebounds, an assist and four steals.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 124-116, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday.

The Cavaliers (31-14) checked in to Friday desperate to snap out of a three-game losing streak, and appeared to have the right opponent to do it with. The Nets (9-37) came in with only two road victories in 22 contests away from Barclays Center, and also opted to rest Brook Lopez and rookie Caris LeVert against Cleveland. Starting power forward Trevor Booker was also absent due to illness, seemingly making a victory a proverbial slam dunk for the defending champs. However, Brooklyn certainly didn't adopt a defeatist mentality, going into halftime with only a 55-47 deficit.   Although the Cavs pulled away in a 39-point third period, the Nets put up a valiant effort overall, seeing six players record double-digit scoring, shooting 49.4 percent from the field and 48.5 percent from three-point range, and prompting Cleveland into 14 turnovers. 

Sean Kilpatrick led the way for the visitors with 18 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Bojan Bogdanovic followed with 17 points, three assists, two rebound and a steal. Randy Foye and Isaiah Whitehead supplied matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding eight boards and five assists and the latter providing three rebounds and three assists. Justin Hamilton went for 12 points, five rebounds, a steal and a block while taking over at center for Lopez, and Spencer Dinwiddie tallied 10 points, one rebound and one assist. 

LeBron James paced the Cavs with 31 points, 11 assists and five rebounds. Kyrie Irving posted 28 points, six assists, four rebounds and two blocks. Kyle Korver totaled 14 points to lead the bench, a total he supplemented with two boards. Kevin Love registered a 13-point, 14-rebound double-double and added two assists, a steal and a block. Tristan Thompson posted a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and a block.

The Nets next travel to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Saturday night, while the Cavaliers are home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday afternoon.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Orlando Magic, 128-98, at TD Garden on Friday evening.

The Celtics (28-18) came in to Friday fresh off a big victory over the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night, a win spearheaded by an explosive 38-point effort from Isaiah Thomas. Their offensive momentum carried over into Friday and generated even better results overall, as Boston posted success rates of 56.2 and 47.1 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively. Instead of Wednesday's top-heavy scoring effort, the Celtics saw six players hit double digits in the scoring column, and played superbly on the defensive end as well, holding the Magic (18-30) to just 65 points through three quarters. 

The Magic were led by a pair of 14-point efforts from Nikola Vucevic and Damjan Rudez, with the latter providing his scoring off the bench. Vucevic added seven boards, two assists and a steal, while Rudez provided an assist, two steals and a block. Aaron Gordon went for 13 points, five boards and a steal. Bismack Biyombo generated 10 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 25 minutes on the second unit. C.J. Watson went for nine points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. 

The Celtics were paced by Thomas' 21 points, a total he supplemented with eight assists, three rebounds and two steals. Rookie Jaylen Brown totaled a career-high 20 points, along with eight boards and two assists. Jae Crowder contributed a full stat line of 19 points, six boards, four assists, two steals and a block. Amir Johnson made the start for Al Horford (groin), managing 10 points, four rebounds, three assists and a block. Kelly Olynyk led the second unit with 16 points, five rebounds and an assist, while Tyler Zeller provided 10 points, three rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block, his first game action since Dec. 29.

The Magic travel to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Sunday evening, while the Celtics head to Milwaukee to face the Bucks on Saturday night.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 102-86, at Air Canada Center on Friday.

Both of these teams have been struggling mightily headed into this matchup, but Toronto prevailed in a near wire-to-wire win. In fact, the Raptors led for the final 42 minutes, as they held a double-digit lead for the majority of that stretch. That's evident by the first quarter, in which Toronto outscored Milwaukee, 36-19. Despite all the statistics being close, the Raptors won nearly every one, as they led in shooting, rebounding, assisting, steals, blocks and turnover differentials. The Raptors defense was huge, as they held the Bucks to 39 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range.

The Bucks (21-25) have now lost seven of their last eight games, as they continue to slide down the standings. Giannis Antetokounmpo once again carried the load, as he tallied 19 points, six rebounds, eight assists and three blocks. Jabari Parker was just as good, totaling 21 points and 13 rebounds. The only other player in double figures was Matthew Dellavedova, who dropped 11 points to accompany two rebounds and to assists. The Bucks will host the Boston Celtics on Saturday for their next game.

The Raptors (29-18) had lost five-straight headed into this game, so a double-digit home win in just what the doctor ordered. Kyle Lowry had to carry the team in the absence of DeMar DeRozan (ankle), as he scored a game-high 32 points to go along with three rebounds and six assists. Norman Powell started for DeRozan and finished second on the team with 19 points and six rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas and Patrick Patterson combined for 18 points, 18 rebounds, three steals and three blocks as the starting frontcourt. Toronto will look to build of this win on Sunday in a home matchup against the Orlando Magic.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 110-107, at Madison Square Garden on Friday.

Despite there being only five ties and six lead changes, this game was close throughout. In fact, neither team led by more than 11 points, as it came down to the finals seconds. New York really turned it on in the fourth quarter, outscoring Charlotte, 28-20. The defensive statistics were decisive, with the Knicks recording eight steals and 10 blocks, while the Hornets tallied just five steals and four blocks. Many of the other statistics were tight, with the two teams tying in fastbreak points and points in the paint, while falling within one rebound of one another.  

The Hornets (23-24) have now lost 10 of their last 14 games, as they continue to regress. Kemba Walker played great off his all-star berth on Thursday, scoring a game-high 31 points to accompany 10 rebounds and five assists. Nicolas Batum fell just shy of a triple-double, collecting 15 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Marvin Williams totaled 17 points and three rebounds. Marco Belinelli was a nice spark off the bench, scoring 15 points in 20 minutes. Charlotte will host the Sacramento Kings on Saturday for their next game. 

The Knicks (21-27) were in a terrible stretch headed into this game, but a win over a team like the Hornets is just what they need to get going. It was a team effort, with six players scoring in double figures, with no one scoring more than 18 points. Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis tied the team-lead with 18 points, as Anthony added 11 rebounds, while Porzingis provided four rebounds and three blocks. Derrick Rose finished with 13 points, two rebounds and four assists before departing in the third quarter with a leg injury. Brandon Jennings stepped in for him off the bench to drop 15 points and add three rebounds and three assists to his tally.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Philadelphia 76ers, 123-118, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday.

Turnover have plagued these two teams all season and 45 combined turnovers in this game shows just that. The third quarter was the difference for Houston, as they outscored Philadelphia, 33-21. Rebounding was also decisive, with Houston winning that battle, 41-29. Both teams surpassed 51 percent shooting, despite the two teams combining for 56 three-point attempts. 

The Rockets (35-15) have rode James Harden all year and he had another showcase performance in this big road win. Harden recorded another triple-double accumulating 51 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists. Nene Hilario got the start and finished second on the team with 21 points, six rebounds and two assists on 10-of-13 shooting. Clint Capela was effective off the bench, providing 17 points and six rebounds. 

The Sixers (17-28) had won eight of 10 headed into this game, but a matchup with the Rockets is a tough task these days. Joel Embiid was the star for Philly, as he led the team with 32 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three steals. T.J. McConnell was second among starters finishing with 13 points and eight assists. Dario Saric, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Gerald Henderson combined for 37 points on 14-of-19 shooting, as they all scored 12 or more. bench scoring, dropping 12 points a piece.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Chicago Bulls, 100-88, at United Center on Friday evening.

The Heat (17-30) checked in to Friday with only seven road wins in 24 games away from American Airlines Arena, but with a potential opportunity to steal a victory against a Bulls (23-25) squad currently besieged by internal spats between Rajon Rondo and team leaders Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade. Chicago head coach Fred Hoiberg had also made the suprising decision to bench the latter two to start the game in favor of Paul Zipser and Doug McDermott, putting the home team at a talent disadvantage to open the contest. Miami was able to capitalize, jumping out to a 33-24 lead after one quarter and then hanging on to outscore their hosts 67-64 the rest of the way. The temporary demotion seemed to affect Butler in particular, as he shot just 1-for-13 from the floor over 33 minutes. The Heat was also able to overcome the absence of Hassan Whiteside (ankle), as Willie Reed stepped up to tally 20 points, five boards, an assist and a steal. 

Goran Dragic's 26 points paced Miami, a total he supplemented with 11 assists, five rebounds and three steals. Dion Waiters continued his strong play with 19 points, five rebounds, an assist and a steal. Wayne Ellington was next with a bench-leading 14 points, which he supplemented with five boards, two assists, two steals and a block. Rodney McGruder totaled nine points, four boards and a trio of steals.

Despite being relegated to the second unit, Wade's 15 points still served as the top score on the Bulls. He added six rebounds, three assists and two steals over 28 minutes. Zipser impressively took advantage of his starting opportunity, posting 14 points, five boards and a steal. Taj Gibson matched Zipser's point total and supplemented it with five rebounds, two assists, four blocks and a steal. Rondo had one of his more productive games, compiling 13 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and three steals. McDermott registered nine points, five boards and two assists. 

The Heat return home to face the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night, while the Bulls remain home to take on the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday evening.

												The visiting New Orleans Pelicans took down the San Antonio Spurs on Friday, 119-103.

A massive fourth quarter lifted New Orleans (19-24) to victory.  The Pelicans outscored their opponents by 25 in the second half, building on the strong play of Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday.  Davis, the 23-year-old superstar forward, pulled down a season-high 22 rebounds on the night, five of which came on the offensive end.  His big contribution on the glass helped the Pelicans establish a 54-44 edge in the rebounding column.  Tenacity on the boards combined with up-tempo, three-point heavy offense for rapid scoring in the second half.  The team drained 13 three-pointers on the night, with Jrue Holiday knocking down three and assisting on several more.  

San Antonio (36-10) is not a team familiar with being blown out, so Friday came as a surprise to most.  Despite coming into the half with a sturdy lead, ice-cold shooting led the Spurs to a tough end result.  The team shot under 39 percent from the field and saw sub-standard shooting even from its stars, as Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge combined for just 12-of-36 on the night.  On top of the poor shooting, it was an off night for the usually air-tight San Antonio defense.  The team managed to force a fair number of turnovers, but still allowed the Pelicans to shoot at over 51 percent on the night.

												The visiting Washington Wizards blew out the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, 112-86

The Wizards (26-20) appear to have found their groove in 2017, as they have now won seven of their last eight contests.  Every piece seemed to be clicking for Washington on Friday, as the team hopped out to a 10-point lead in the game's first three minutes and only ran further away from there. Though the Wizards rank as the league's second-worst three-point shooting team, the deep ball played a major part in their approach on Friday.  The team shot 13-of-31 from beyond the arc.  It was truly an all-encompassing victory, however, as defense and tenacity on the glass played an equally major role in earning the win.  Washington held a 52-41 advantage on the glass and recorded 12 steals along with 10 blocked shots.  Atlanta was forced into a ridiculous 19 turnovers on the night.

The Hawks (27-20) seemed to be in good shape heading into Friday but received a complete beat-down.  The loss comes at an inopportune time for Atlanta, who had been just one game back from second place in the Eastern Conference prior to Friday's loss. The team suffered one of its worst defeats of the season in the matchup, shooting just 36 percent and under 30 percent from beyond the arc.  In particular, recently-named All-Star Paul Millsap struggled, shooting just 1-of-7 for four points with four rebounds.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, 112-109.  

Portland (21-27) has looked stronger lately after a dismal start to the season.  On Friday, the Blazers pushed past the more than likely playoff-bound Grizzlies thanks in large part to the play of star point guard Damian Lillard.  Lillard scored a team-high 33 points and hit five three-pointers to go with 10-of-11 at the free-throw line.  Lillard's top notch shooting was just part of an impressive output for the Blazers from beyond the arc.  The team relied heavily on the deep ball, shooting 16-of-35 from beyond the arc.  The solid shooting night was crucial for Portland, as the team was characteristically weak on the boards.  The Blazers were out-rebounded 42-33 on the night.

Memphis (27-21) was coming off a big win over Toronto in which All-Star center Marc Gasol scored a career-high 42.  Gasol hardly slowed down on Friday, scoring 32 points to go with eight rebounds and five assists.  Point guard Mike Conley added 17 points and 10 assists, helping to spark a fair amount of offense for the veteran-heavy Grizz.  The team played effectively all night, shooting a solid 48 percent from the field and dishing 24 assists.  Ultimately, the team was unable to limit Portland's outside scoring enough to earn the win.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 109-98, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Thursday.

The Mavericks (16-30) checked in to Thursday's contest as one of the stingiest defenses in the league, and they certainly held their own against a high-octane Thunder (28-19) squad overall. However, they couldn't truly contain Russell Westbrook, who may not have tallied one of his trademark triple-double, but who still went for a game-high 45 points, a total he supplemented with eight rebounds, three assists and two steals. Westbrook was 16-of-29 from the floor, including an outstanding 4-of-8 from three-point range. The Mavs put in a valiant effort, particularly considering they were without both Deron Williams (toe) and Dirk Nowitzki (rest), even leading 26-23 after one quarter. However, the Thunder and Westbrook gained some separation during a third quarter in which the hosts scored 34 points, sending Dallas to their 18th road loss in 24 games.

With two of his veteran teammates on the bench Thursday, Harrison Barnes took on a particularly pivotal role for the Mavs, posting a team-high 31 points, along with two rebounds, two assists and a steal. Justin Anderson was next with a bench-leading 17 points, which he complemented with five rebounds and an assist. Dorian Finney-Smith and Seth Curry were next with matching 11-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, two assists, four steals and a block, and the latter supplying four assists, a rebound and a steal. Pierre Jackson drew the start for Williams and provided nine points, four assists and two rebounds. 

Victor Oladipo was a distant second behind Westbrook, managing 17 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Steven Adams posted 15 points and seven boards. Donatas Sabonis tallied 10 points, five boards and a steal. Cameron Payne led the bench with six points in 13 minutes.

The Mavericks head to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Sunday night, while the Thunder visit the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday afternoon.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 109-103 Thursday at Target Center. 

The Pacers (23-22) came into Thursday's matchup as one of the worst road teams in the NBA, boasting a 6-16 record away from home. They were, however, able to end a three-game losing streak and pull this one out, but it didn't come without a few heroic offensive performances. Paul George led the way with a team-high 32 points, five assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes, while young star Myles Turner an efficient 23 points on 10-of-14 shooting from the field on top of six rebounds. But in the backcourt, point guard Jeff Teague put together one of the best all-around performances of his first season with the Pacers, scoring 20 points, dishing out 13 assists and grabbing what ended up being a team-high eight rebounds. The three ended up accounting for 75 of the team's 109 points, with no other Indiana player managing to score in double figures. In the end, the Pacers won the game through their play on the perimeter, with the team shooting an impressive 10-of-18 (55.6 percent) from downtown.

As for the Timberwolves (17-29), the biggest issues they've faced all season -- poor defense and lack of depth -- surfaced in Thursday's contest. Despite getting three stellar performances from their three young stars, they got no help from any of their teammates, and no one could stop the Pacers' offensive attack. Karl-Anthony Towns finished with a game-high 33 points on top of 10 rebounds and four assists, while Zach LaVine added 23 points and Andrew Wiggins posted 21 of his own. Their Minnesota teammates, however, managed to score just 26 points, causing them to fall just short and putting their three-game win streak to an end.

Up next, the Pacers will head home Friday to take on the Kings, while the Timberwolves will look to get back on the right track Saturday against the Nets.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 127-120, at Pepsi Center on Thursday. 

Despite there being just nine ties and eight lead changes, this game was close throughout. In fact, neither team was able to grab a double-digit lead, with the Nuggets overcoming a four-point deficit at the half. Both offenses were on point, with Denver shooting 51 percent and Phoenix hitting 54 percent of their shots. Rebounding was the decisive statistic for the Nuggets, as they won that battle, 46-28. Denver also controlled the game at the free-throw line, going 30-of-35 from the charity stripe. 

The Suns (15-31) put in a valiant effort on the road, but fell short, thanks to some lackluster defense. Eric Bledsoe did all he could for Phoenix, leading the team with 28 points, four rebounds and five assists. Devin Booker wasn't far behind, accumulating 24 points and six assists. T.J. Warren totaled 21 points and eight rebounds. Brandon Knight led the bench in scoring and assists, amassing 17 points and four dimes. 

The Nuggets (20-25) have been much better over recent weeks, as this marks their sixth win in eight games. Nikola Jokic continued his tear, as he tallied 29 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists. Danilo Gallinari was second on the team, finishing with 25 points and seven rebounds. Jameer Nelson started for Emmanuel Mudiay (back) and accrued 13 points, four rebounds and nine assists in 41 minutes of action. Wilson Chandler was a huge spark off the bench, dropping 16 points to go along with two rebounds and four assists. 

These two teams will have a rematch on Thursday in Phoenix for their next fixture.

												The host Utah Jazz took down the visiting Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, 96-88.

Utah (30-18) had lost two straight but bounced back quickly on Thursday, winning convincingly over Los Angeles.  It was a big day for Utah, as star forward Gordon Hayward was named to his first career All-Star Game as a reserve.  Hayward played like an All-Star on Thursday, snapping a cold streak to shoot 7-of-14 for 24 points.  Center Rudy Gobert, meanwhile, told the media earlier in the day that he would use being snubbed from the All-Star Game to fuel himself to perform as the season goes on.  Gobert looked like he meant it on Thursday, as he pulled down a team-high 13 rebounds and blocked a whopping five shots.  His strong play helped to anchor the tough Utah defense, which held the Lakers to just 42 percent shooting and only four three-pointers.

Los Angeles (16-34), meanwhile, saw disastrous play from its starting five, leading to a heavy reliance on bench output.  The team's starters combined for only 32 points and four assists in what was an abysmal night for the unit.  A handful of bench players provided a spark to keep LA within striking distance, however.  Sixth man Lou Williams offered yet another strong bench performance, leading the team with 20 points.  Rookie center Ivica Zubac, meanwhile, contributed his third career double-double and his second in a row.  

The Jazz will host the Grizzlies on Saturday, while the Lakers will enjoy almost a week of rest.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in overtime, 116-112, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday.

The Cavs (30-14) came in to Wednesday's contest looking to right some of the ills that had plagued them over their previous seven games, a stretch in which they'd suffered five defeats. The Kings (18-27) may have initially looked like easy prey, considering their losing record and the fact that they'd recently lost their second-best playmaker, Rudy Gay, for the season with an Achilles injury. However, the old adage of ""that's why they play the games"" rang particularly true Wednesday, as Sacramento forced the Cavs into an uncharacteristic 18 turnovers and made the shots when it counted most to emerge as surprising victors. DeMarcus Cousins naturally played a pivotal role, posting a near triple-double with a game-high 28 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists, three steals and a block. He made a driving layup with three seconds remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime, and then made another in the extra period to help the Kings come back from a 111-106 deficit with 2:30 remaining.

Darren Collison followed Cousins with 23 points, five assists, three rebounds, two steals and a block. Arron Afflalo posted 14 points, three assists and two rebounds. Garrett Temple supplied 12 points, four rebounds, two assists and four steals. Malachi Richardson led the second unit with 12 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Willie Cauley-Stein was productive in a reserve role as well, tallying eight points, 10 boards, a steal and a block. 

LeBron James did his part for Cleveland, supplying a 24-point, 13-rebound, 11-assist triple-double that also included two steals and a block. Kevin Love was next with a 21-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included five assists and a steal. Kyrie Irving rounded out the Big Three's night with 20 points, six assists, a rebound, two steals and two blocks. Iman Shumpert provided a nice complementary contribution of 16 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Kyle Korver paced the second unit with 12 points, three assists, a rebound and a block.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Houston Rockets, 120-109, at TD Garden on Wednesday evening.

The Celtics (27-18) couldn't quite keep up with the fast-paced Rockets (34-15) in the first half, but they made up for it after intermission. Boston outscored their visitors by a 68-51 margin over the third and fourth periods, despite the game being knotted at 98 as late as the 5:12 mark of the final quarter. That's when Isaiah Thomas drained two clutch free throws after a flagrant-1 foul on James Harden for hitting Jonas Jerebko in the face, and then followed those points with a jumper and a driving hook. The Celtics then scored 16 points the rest of the way while holding the Rockets to 11, sealing the double-digit home win. Both teams had a hard time hanging on to the ball, as Houston was guilty of 17 turnovers while Boston gave it away 18 times. 

James Harden led the way for the Rockets with a 30-point, 12-assist double-double that also included six rebounds, a steal and a block. Ryan Anderson produced 19 points, five rebounds, an assist and a steal. Trevor Ariza and Clint Capela followed with matching 12-point efforts, with the former adding two rebounds, two assists and a steal, and the latter registering seven boards, an assist and two blocks. All of Ariza's points notably came on four three-pointers. Sam Dekker paced the second unit with 15 points, four rebounds, a steal and a block, while Montrezl Harrell tallied 11 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal in a reserve role as well.

Isaiah Thomas continued his stellar play while leading the Celtics with 38 points, nine assists, five rebounds and a steal. With Avery Bradley (Achilles) still out, his usage continues to be at a sky-high rate, as evidenced by Wednesday's 27 shot attempts. Jae Crowder stepped up with a 23-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and a steal. Al Horford supplied a near double-double of 20 points, nine assists, three rebounds, three steals and two blocks, and had a first-half ending buzzer-beating three-pointer. Jonas Jerebko and Jaylen Brown, making starts in place of Amir Johnson and Bradley, respectively, could only combine for nine points and took just seven shot attempts between them. Marcus Smart, who went to the bench in favor of Brown, and Gerald Green led the second unit with matching seven-point tallies.

The Rockets next travel to Philadelphia to do battle with the Sixers on Friday night, while the Celtics remain home to tangle with the Orlando Magic on Friday evening as well.

												The Miami Heat defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 109-106, at Barclay's Center on Wednesday.

This was a game that appeared to be over headed into the fourth quarter, but Miami had other ideas. In fact, Brooklyn led by 18 points headed into the fourth quarter, as the Heat outscored the Nets, 38-17, to pull out an amazing comeback win. The statistics tell the story, with Miami winning the shooting, rebounding, assisting and turnover differentials. Three-point shooting was a huge factor as well, with the Heat hitting 11-of-23, while the Nets went just 13-of-35 from long range. 

The Heat (16-30) have now won five-straight games, with this victory being the most satisfying of the bunch. Goran Dragic fell just shy of a triple-double, as he accumulated 17 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. Dion Waiters led the team in scoring for the third-straight game, as he tallied 24 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Wayne Ellington was huge off the bench, dropping 22 points and adding four boards. Willie Reed and Okaro White were also nice sparks off the bench, combining for 24 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks. Miami will look to keep rolling on Friday against the Miami Heat.

The Nets (9-36) have had a rough season, as epic meltdowns like this show just how bad they're struggling. Brook Lopez did all he could though, as he scored a game-high 33 points, to go along with four rebounds and three assists. Bojan Bogdanovic was second on the team, as he accrued 17 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Caris LeVert was the only bench player in double figures, providing 12 points and four assists. The Nets will play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday for their next game.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Charlotte Hornets 113-103 Wednesday at Spectrum Center. 

The game didn't come as easy to the Warriors (39-7) as the final score may indicate, as Golden State was behind for a good chunk of the second half of Wednesday's contest. It wasn't until midway through the final period that the Warriors were finally able to catch up and regain the lead -- a lead they wouldn't let go of for the final stretch. Kevin Durant was dominant in the winning effort, scoring a game-high 33 points in 37 minutes, while Steph Curry added 28 points of his own while shooting 6-of-12 from behind the arc. The two carried the load for most of the way, as they had to, with the five reserves who played off the bench Wednesday managing to score just a combined 18 points. 

For the Hornets (23-23), the loss is their second in a row and drops them back down to .500 on the season. Kemba Walker did all he could, as he continues to make his case for the All-Star game, scoring a team-high 26 points and dishing out eight assists in 38 minutes. Nicolas Batum also put together a solid all-around night, posting 16 points, eight rebounds and six assists in 38 minutes of his own. Charlotte badly missed starting center Cody Zeller (quad), however, as the three centers who played Wednesday struggled mightily. Roy Hibbert, Frank Kaminsky and Spencer Hawes shot a combined 7-of-24 (29 percent) from the field en route to scoring just 18 points. 

Up next, the Warriors will head to Los Angeles on Saturday to take on the Clippers, while the Hornets will look to get back on the right track Friday in New York against the Knicks.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 119-114, Wednesday at the United Center.

With just over three minutes to go in the final quarter, the Bulls (23-24) held a 10-point lead. At that point, however, something clicked for the Hawks (27-19). Over the next two minutes, Atlanta got back-to-back-to-back made threes from Paul Millsap, Dennis Schroeder and Tim Hardaway Jr. to bring them within one before a Schroeder layup gave them the lead for good. In the end, it turned out to be a brilliant team performance from Atlanta, with all five of their starters scoring in double figures. Schroeder led the way with 24 points and nine assists, while Paul Millsap managed to produce 21 points and six rebounds of his own. As a team, as shown by their shooting down the stretch, the Hawks were on fire from behind the arc, hitting an incredible 17 of their 30 attempts from long range (56.7 percent).

As for the Bulls, they received a pair of superstar performances from Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade, but ultimately, it just wasn't enough. Butler scored a game-high 40 points in 40 minutes, while Wade added 33 points of his own in 31 minutes, but unfortunately for Chicago, the duo failed to get any help from their teammates. The only other Bulls player to reach double-digit scoring was Doug McDermott, who scored just 10 points in 23 minutes off the bench. And while Butler and Wade combined to shoot an impressive 59 percent from the field, the rest of the team managed to shoot just 35.4 percent, spoiling the night for Chicago. 

Up next, the Hawks will head home Friday to take on the Wizards, while the Bulls will stay home Friday to take on the surging Heat.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 114-109 Wednesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center. 

One night after the Bucks (21-24) get a much-needed win at home against the Rockets, the 76ers (17-27) come to town and play spoiler. On the second night of a back-to-back set without both Joel Embiid and Jahlil Okafor, Philadelphia managed to find a way to pull away late and end Milwaukee's win streak at one game. Meanwhile, the 76ers themselves extended their win streak to two games and have now won five of their last six games. Wednesday's win came on the shoulders off an excellent performance from Gerald Henderson off the bench, as the shooting guard scored a team-high 20 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field. Additionally, Nerlens Noel, who was filling the shoes of both Embiid and Okafor, came up with a double-double of 16 points and 13 rebounds in just 28 minutes. As a team, it was a very strong shooting night for Philadelphia, as they shot 53.3 percent from the field overall and 46.2 percent from behind the arc.

For the Bucks, they continue to struggle, as they have now lost six of their last seven games -- two of which have now come at home to the 76ers. This was despite a terrific performance off the bench from Greg Monroe, who posted 28 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. Jabari Parker added 20 points of his own, while Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid overall game of 17 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and four steals, but ultimately it wasn't enough, as the other three Milwaukee starters managed to score just 22 combined points. On top of it all, the Bucks ending the game on two consecutive turnovers was indicative of the night they had taking care of the ball, as they finished the game with a total of 19.

												The host Memphis Grizzlies narrowly beat the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, 101-99.

Memphis (27-20) earned a much-needed win on Wednesday, as it had dropped four of its last six contests heading into the game.  The Grizzlies were able to prevail against a tough competitor, however, on the backs of strong play from center Marc Gasol.  Gasol scored a career-high 42 points including 19 in the first quarter, and also pulled down seven rebounds.  The veteran big man shot 14-of-25 and hit five three-pointers, effectively keeping the team's shooting afloat while the remainder of the roster had somewhat of an off night.  Memphis also caught a bit of a break at the free-throw line, where Toronto made just 11-of-19 on the night.

Toronto (28-18) has now lost five straight and is just half of a game ahead of Boston for second in the Eastern Conference.  Part of the team's struggles has been the absence of star guard DeMar DeRozan (ankle), who missed action again on Wednesday.  Guard Norman Powell provided stellar offense in his stead, scoring 21 points with five rebounds.  Point guard Kyle Lowry led the team, scoring 29 and dishing eight assists.  The team struggled to find its shot, however, hitting just 42 percent on the night.  Containing Marc Gasol proved difficult for the Raptors as well, particularly out of the break.  The team gave up two Gasol-led scoring runs at the start of each half.  

Toronto will host the Bucks on Friday, while the Grizzlies will visit Portland.

												The visiting Oklahoma City Thunder pulled out a win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, 114-105.

The Thunder (27-19) capped off a six-game road trip on Wednesday, finishing 3-3 during the stretch thanks to the win in New Orleans.  Point guard Russell Westbrook recorded what has become an almost routine triple-double in the victory, scoring 27 points to go with 12 rebounds and 10 assists.  The triple-double, Westbrook's 24th of the season, keeps the All-Star on pace to eclipse Wilt Chamberlain's ridiculous record of 41 triple-doubles in one season.  In addition to typical strong play from Westbrook, the Thunder benefited from the partial absence of Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis, who left the game with a quad contusion.  With the New Orleans frontcourt depleted, OKC's big men were able to feast on the boards.  The team held an eight-rebound advantage and both Steven Adams and Enes Kanter posted double-doubles in the win.  

Due in part to the departure of Davis, New Orleans (18-28) relied heavily on bench production to keep the game close.  Guard E'Twaun Moore came off the bench for 18 points, a team high, and pulled down eight rebounds.  Three members of the second unit finished with double digit points totals, and sixth man Tyreke Evans provided help facilitating the offense as he dished out nine assists.  Ultimately, however, Davis's absence and a thin  frontcourt ended up being problematic for the Pelicans.  In addition to the rebounding deficit, New Orleans saw 11 of its shots blocked on the night.  

OKC will host the Mavericks on Thursday, while New Orleans will play host to the Spurs on Friday.

												The host Dallas Mavericks beat the New York Knicks on Wednesday, 103-95.

Dallas (16-29) has now won five of its last seven contests and is looking like a team that could cause trouble in the wide-open eighth seed race in the Western Conference.  After a 49-point drubbing of the Lakers on Sunday, the Mavs handed a loss to another big-market team when the Knicks came to town.  Forward Harrison Barnes contributed heavily to the win, leading the team with 23 points.  The team also saw encouraging play from veteran big man Dirk Nowitzki, who contributed 19 points in one of his better performances in what has been an up-and-down season.  The Mavs put together a stellar offensive night from the floor, shooting 47 percent, despite an abysmal performance from beyond the arc.  

The Knicks (20-27) have been sliding lately, having now dropped five of their last seven.  Amidst rumors that he was shopped around to teams such as Cleveland, aging star Carmelo Anthony led the team with 30 points on Wednesday.  The stellar outing was not enough for the win, however, as New York's struggles continued to show.  New York posted an abysmal turnover differential, coughing the ball up 18 times while forcing only seven turnovers from Dallas.  Additionally, the team shot just 42 percent and hit only seven three-pointers.  

The Mavericks will play in OKC on Thursday, while the Knicks will host the Hornets on Friday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 105-98 at Moda Center on Wednesday. 

The Blazers (20-27) turned to C.J. McCollum late in the fourth quarter for back-to-back buckets to extend the lead to five points, and while the Lakers (16-33) had an answer with an emphatic Larry Nance Jr. dunk, Portland sealed the deal behind Damian Lillard's floater with :48 remaining in the fourth quarter. Lou Williams provided the scoring for Los Angeles and thrived off the bench with 31 points on 10-of-20 shooting. Williams hot hand kept the Lakers within striking distance though out the back-and-forth affair. 

Lillard and McCollum both finished with 24 points each, and combined for eight rebounds and six assists. Portland picked up their third win over the Lakers this season, and have only one game remaining in the series. 

The Lakers, as a unit, were unable to consistently shoot from the field and behind the three point line, evidenced by their 39.4 percent effort. Jordan Clarkson added 22 points in his bench role, while the starters remained relatively absent in terms of scoring, with only Nick Young finding double figures with 15 points on 3-of-6 shooting from deep.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Toronto Raptors 108-106 Tuesday at AirCanada Centre.

The Spurs (36-9) came into Tuesday's matchup without Pau Gasol (finger), Kawhi Leonard (hand) and Tony Parker (foot), but it didn't matter. Even without three regular starters, San Antonio was able to hold off a struggling Raptors (28-17) team, who remains without their All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan (ankle). In the absence of three stars, LaMarcus Aldridge stepped up with a solid performance, recording a team-high 21 points on 6-of-14 shooting from the field to go along with seven rebounds. Patty Mills then added 18 points in 30 critical minutes off the bench. Overall, it wasn't the prettiest performance from San Antonio, as they shot just 44.7 percent from the field and 29.2 percent from behind the arc, but they still managed to notch their fifth straight victory.

As for the Raptors, they continue to struggle, as they have now lost four games in a row after winning four in a row just before that. They had a prime opportunity to end that streak against a banged up San Antonio team, but while Kyle Lowry and the Toronto backcourt managed to take advantage, the frontcourt players struggled to do so. Lowry finished with a game-high 30 points and five rebounds, while Terrance Ross and Norman Powell added 21 and 16 points, respectively. The team's start frontcourt, however, made up of Jonas Valanciunas, Jared Sullinger and DeMarre Carroll combined to score a grand total of just 11 points. Ball disruption was the ultimate problem, however, as the team managed just 10 assists to their 10 turnovers.

Up next,  the Spurs will try to make it six straight wins Friday in New Orleans, while the the Raptors will look to end their losing streak when they take on the Grizzlies on Wednesday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 121-110, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday. 

With many important pieces missing this game for both teams, there were numerous swings that ultimately led to a Sixers win. It was a tale of two halves, with the Clippers leading by nine after the first half and the Sixers outscoring Los Angeles by 20 in the second half. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the decisive statistic, with the Sixers recording 35 assists to five turnovers, while the Clippers matched their assists and turnovers at 17 a piece. Scoring in the paint was extremely lopsided as well, with Philadelphia winning that battle, 66-20. Free-throw shooting also killed Los Angeles, as they went 26-of-41, while Philly went 21-of-22.

The Clippers (30-17) got Blake Griffin back for this game, but it still wasn't enough to beat a hungry Philly team. Griffin recorded a double-double in his return, totaling 12 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. Jamal Crawford was the teams best player, dropping 27 points on 9-of-14 shooting off the bench. J.J, Redick finished with with 22 points, while Austin Rivers tallied 20 points, two rebounds and three assists. DeAndre Jordan did collect 10 points, 20 rebounds and three assists, but went 4-of-12 from the free-throw line. 

The Sixers (16-27) played this game without Joel Embiid (knee) and Jahlil Okafor (knee), but they put in a valiant effort and pulled out an upset win. Nerlens Noel starter for Embiid and accumulated 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two steals and three blocks in his best game of the season. Robert Covington contributed 14 points, eight rebounds, three steals and two blocks. Richaun Holmes was second on the team in scoring, dropping 18 points off the bench. Dario Saric was also huge off the bench, amassing 16 points and eight rebounds. Sergio Rodriguez and T.J. McConnell played all the point guard minutes and combined for 18 points and 17 assists.

												The Washington Wizards (25-20) defeated the Boston Celtics (26-18), 123-108, at Verizon Center on Tuesday.

The two teams checked in to Tuesday's tilt heading in opposite directions, as Boston had dropped two straight contests while Washington had prevailed in five of their previous six. That trend persisted through the opening 12 minutes, as the home team emerged from that period with a 33-24 advantage. Although the Celtics battled back in the second quarter, the Wizards won the second half by a 57-49 margin to pull away for a 15-point victory. Washington's Big Three of John Wall, Bradley Beal and Markieff Morris combined for 77 points on 55.7 percent shooting, allowing the Wizards to overcome 15 turnovers. 

Isaiah Thomas paced the Celtics with a 25-point, 13-assist double-double that also included a rebound and two steals. Al Horford totaled 22 points, four assists, two rebounds and a block. Jae Crowder managed 17 points, six rebounds, three assists and a steal. Marcus Smart drew another start in place of Avery Bradley (Achilles) and posted 13 points, five rebounds, an assist and four steals. Jonas Jerebko and Jaylen Brown led the second unit with a pair of eight-point efforts. 

Beal led the way with a game-high 31 points, which he supplemented with five assists, two rebounds and two steals. Wall supplied 27 points, seven rebounds, seven assists, three steals and a block. Morris followed with a 19-point, 11-rebound double-double that also featured four assists and a pair of blocks. With his three talented teammates tallying such high usage rates, Otto Porter, Jr. provided a modest six points and four rebounds. Kelly Oubre, Jr. continued his strong play off the bench with 11 points, three rebounds, a steal and a block. 

The Celtics head back home to face off with the Houston Rockets on Wednesday evening, while the Wizards travel to Atlanta to battle with the Hawks on Friday night.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Orlando Magic 100-92 Tuesday night at the Amway Center.

The victory was the second in a row for the Bulls (23-23), and it brought the team back up to .500 on the season. Chicago was led by Dwyane Wade on both sides of the ball, as he recorded a team-high 21 points, seven rebounds and three assists on top of an incredible seven steals on the defensive end. All-Star Jimmy Butler wasn't too far behind either, posting 20 points, eight rebounds, four assists and three steals of his own. The duo accounted for 10 of the Bulls' 13 takeaways Tuesday night. As a team, it wasn't the most impressive shooting night for Chicago, as they hit just 45.5 percent of their field goal attempts, but what carried them to victory was their ability to make it to the free throw line. In total, they hit 23-of-30 shots at the charity stripe.

For the Magic (18-29), Tuesday's loss was their second in a row and their fifth in their last six games. And the loss came despite a solid outing from their starting five, who all managed to score in double figures. It was the lack of production off the bench, however, that ultimately led to their inability to keep pace with the Bulls. The four reserves that saw action on Tuesday managed to score just 20 total points despite each one playing at least 13 minutes. It also didn't help that Orlando struggled mightily to take care of the basketball, producing 19 total turnovers to just 18 assists. In the end, it was Nikola Vucevic who led the way for the Magic, recording 20 points and eight rebounds in 33 minutes.

Up next, the Bulls will look to earn their third straight win at home Wednesday against the Hawks, while the Magic will head to Boston on Friday to play the Celtics.

												The host Denver Nuggets beat the Utah Jazz on Tuesday, 103-93.

Denver (19-25) has now won four in a row at home and has become one of the hottest teams in the West, due largely to the emergence of sophomore Nikola Jokic.  The 21-year-old center has been dominant since the start of the new year, and was effective once again on Tuesday despite Utah's tough defensive frontcourt.  Jokic scored 23 points and pulled down 11 rebounds and made a surprising impact on defense with two steals and three blocks.  The young star's scoring touch and elite passing was the backbone of a strong offensive effort for Denver.  The team scored a combined 62 in the second and third quarter and finished the night shooting over 46 percent while dishing out 28 assists.

Utah (29-18), on the other hand, was not quite as hot on the offensive end.  In particular, Gordon Hayward and George Hill, who typically form the crux of the Jazz offense, both struggled from the field.  Hayward scored only nine points, while Hill went just 6-of-18 from the field.  What was reassuring for Utah, however, was that forward Derrick Favors produced a strong performance.  Favors, who has seen his season plagued by injuries thus far, led the Jazz with 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting and was responsible for a handful of key plays on defense.   That said, Tuesday's outing was likely one that Utah will be eager to forget; the Jazz shot just 41 percent from the field as a team and were out-rebounded.  

The Nuggets will host the Suns on Thursday, while the Jazz will host the Lakers.

												The visiting Minnesota Timberwolves took down the Phoenix Suns in dramatic fashion on Tuesday, 112-111.

Tuesday's matchup offered a clash of two of the league's brightest young teams.  The end result was a thriller, as Minnesota (17-28) managed to come away with the win following a contested buzzer-beater from small forward Andrew Wiggins.  Wiggins finished the night as the game's leading scorer with 31 points and came up clutch on the defensive end with two steals.  Reigning Rookie of the Year and star Karl-Anthony Towns also played a big part in the Wolves' win, as he came away with 18 points and 10 rebounds on the night.  While Minnesota made plenty of mistakes, including sending Phoenix to the free-throw line 32 times, the Wolves were ultimately able to capitalize on their 52 percent shooting from the field to earn the victory.

Phoenix (15-30), meanwhile, sits near the bottom of the league but had won two straight before hosting Minny on Tuesday.  A big piece of the Suns' recent success has been another sophomore phenom, Devin Booker.  Booker scored 26 against the Timberwolves to lead the team and extend his 20-point game streak to ten.  The Suns also saw perhaps the biggest game of the season for aging veteran Tyson Chandler.  The center had 22 points on 9-of-9 shooting and pulled down 17 rebounds.  

The Suns will visit Denver on Thursday, while Minnesota will host the Pacers.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 109-99, at Spectrum Center on Monday night.

The Wizards (24-20) could hardly have been blamed for potentially coming in to Monday with a bit of a hangover from their last game, a heartbreaking 113-112 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. Washington saw a 112-111 lead go by the wayside at the buzzer courtesy of a Marcus Morris tip-in, and they were facing another formidable challenge in the form of a surging Hornets (23-22) squad that had won three in a row. However, the Wizards were up to the task, jumping on their hosts from the opening quarter and never letting up. Washington played very well on both sides of the ball, tallying 53.8 and 40.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, and also limiting Charlotte to 38.9 and 25.0 percent figures in those categories. John Wall and Markieff Morris led the way by combining for 47 points and 51.5 percent shooting. 

Wall's 24 points paced the Wizards, and he added seven assists, four rebounds and a steal. Morris followed with 23 points, a total he supplemented with eight rebounds and two assists. Bradley Beal was a highly effective third wheel with 18 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal. Otto Porter, Jr. contributed a 14-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included two assists. Marcin Gortat put forward a modest eight points and seven boards, along with an assist, a steal and a block. Kelly Oubre, Jr. led the second unit with 10 points, two rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. 

Kemba Walker led the way for the Hornets with 21 points, five assists, two rebounds and a block. Marco Belinelli tallied 18 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal to lead the bench. Cody Zeller and Marvin Williams followed with matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding nine rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks, and the latter supplying eight boards, four assists, two steals and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist totaled eight points, seven boards, an assist and a block, and Nicolas Batum had a relatively quiet game by his standards, especially on the scoreboard, posting four points, six assists and seven rebounds.

The Wizards head back home to face off with the Boston Celtics on Tuesday evening, while the Hornets remain home to face off with the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-86, at Barclays Center on Monday evening.

The Spurs (35-9) learned earlier in the day that they'd go to battle with the Nets (9-35) without the services of their MVP, Kawhi Leonard. The All-Star forward, who'd scored a career-high 41 points in the overtime victory against the Cavaliers on Saturday, need to give a sore hand a rest, which brought Kyle Anderson into the starting five. Coach Gregg Popovich also opted to slide Dewayne Dedmon into the first unit at center and have David Lee come off the bench. Both sets of moves were effective, as the trio of aforementioned players enjoyed productive outings. The Spurs also significantly outperformed the Nets in both the rebounding and turnover departments, winning the war down low by a 50-38 margin and taking the ball away from Brooklyn on 16 occasions, double the amount of their own miscues.

Patty Mills paced the Spurs with 20 points, a total he complemented with three rebounds and two assists, all in just 20 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge followed with 16 points, nine rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Lee totaled 15 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal despite coming off the bench. Anderson registered 14 points, three rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal in his spot start. Davis Bertans and Jonathan Simmons were also productive as reserves with matching 11-point efforts. Dedmon acquitted himself in his start, compiling 10 points, eight boards, an assist, a steal and a block. Danny Green and heralded rookie Dejounte Murray went for nine and four points, respectively, with the latter making up for a 2-of-8 shooting night with six rebounds and three assists.

The Nets' top two scorers actually came from the bench, with Isaiah Whitehead leading the way. The reserve guard provided 19 points, three assists and a rebound. Former starter Sean Kilpatrick was right behind him with a 17-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist. Spencer Dinwiddie led the first unit with 13 points, two rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Brook Lopez managed a modest 12 points, four rebounds, an assist, a block and a steal in 21 minutes. The remainder of the starting five couldn't do much, with Trevor Booker (nine points, four rebounds), Bojan Bogdanovic (five points, three rebounds, two assists) and Randy Foye (one point, four assists, three rebounds) turning in serviceable-to-underwhelming performances.

The Spurs make the trek north of the border to tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night, while the Nets remain home and await the Miami Heat for a Wednesday night showdown.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Atlanta Hawks, 115-105, at Philips Arena on Monday. 

Atlanta were expected to win this game easily with the recent form of Los Angeles, but the Clippers back-ups fought hard for an important road win. The bench was the difference in the game, with the Clippers bench outscoring the Hawks bench, 38-13. Three-point shooting was a huge factor as well, with Los Angeles going 14-of-24, while Atlanta hit just 9-of-29 from long distance. Most of the damage was done in the first half for the Clippers, as they led, 58-40, headed into the locker room.

The Clippers (30-16) had to play this game without Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, but pulled out one of their biggest road wins of the season. Austin Rivers was the player of the game, as he tallied 27 points, four rebounds and six assists. Jamal Crawford was second on the team, as he provided 19 points and four assists to lead the bench. J.J. Redick collected 17 points, three rebounds and three assists. Raymond Felton filled-in for Paul to contribute 14 points, five rebounds and three assists. Los Angeles will travel to play the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday for their next game.

The Hawks (26-19) came into this matchup winning 11 of their last 13 games, but suffered a terrible defeat against a shorthanded Clippers team here. Kent Bazmore had one of his best games of the season though, leading the team with 25 points. Dennis Schroeder was second on the team, as he accumulated 21 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Paul Millsap flirted with a triple-double, amassing 19 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Dwight Howard recorded a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Golden State Warriors 105-102 Monday at AmericanAirlines Arena. 

After Kevin Durant tied the game at 102 with just over 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Dion Waiters held the ball at the top of the key while the clock ticked down. With a little over two seconds on the clock, Waiters launched a shot from behind the arc. The shot hit nothing but net and the Heat pulled off one of the biggest upset victories in the NBA this season. Waiters was not only the hero, but he was also the star, as he finished with a game-high 33 points on 13-of-20 shooting from the field and 6-of-8 from 3-point land in 33 minutes. As a team, the Heat were scorching from behind the arc, hitting a ridiculous 43.3 percent of their shots from long range in the winning effort. The win gives Miami their fourth straight victory as they were perfect over their four-game home stand.

Meanwhile, the loss ends the Warriors' (38-7) seven-game win streak, as it ended up being too little too late in the closing moments for the NBA's top team. Durant led the way in the scoring column, finishing with 27 points on 12-of-23 shooting from the field, but he did shoot just 1-of-8 from behind the arc. Additionally, Steph Curry almost put together a triple-double, as he recorded 21 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in 37 minutes. Klay Thompson added 22 of his own, but JaVale McGee's 10 points made him the fourth and final Warriors to score in double figures.

Up next, the Heat will look to continue their winning ways in Brooklyn on Wednesday, while the Warriors will look to return to form against the Hornets on Wednesday.

												The visiting Sacramento Kings took down the Detroit Pistons on Monday, 109-104.

Sacramento (19-27) was relieved to win the close game after losing its last contest on a questionable call in the final minute against Chicago.  Superstar center DeMarcus Cousins voiced his disdain through sarcastic praise of the referees to the media. Cousins did not let the frustration carry over to the court, however, as he continued his consistently strong play.  The All-Star led the Kings with 22 points, 14 rebounds, six assists, two steals, and a block against Detroit.  His rebounding effort helped the team earn a strong seven-rebound advantage on the glass, a difference that ended up helping Sacramento to take the game.  

For Detroit (21-25), the win does not help the team's effort to push into the wide-open bottom of the Eastern Conference playoff race.  The Pistons had sat just one game back of the eighth seed, but now trail Chicago by a game and a half.  Most things went right for the Pistons on Monday, as the team came out for a strong 38-point first quarter and finished shooting 50 percent from the field.  The team hit ten three-pointers and dished out a stellar 27 assists as well.  However, a weak bench performance, both on offense and on the glass, ended up hampering the efforts of Detroit's starting five.  

The Kings will visit Cleveland on Wednesday, while Detroit will not face off until Saturday in Miami.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Houston Rockets 127-114 Monday at BMO Harris Bradley Center.

Not even a week after the Bucks (21-23) got blown out by the Rockets (34-14) in Houston, they return the favor on their home floor in Milwaukee, as the Bucks' young stars put on a show to earn the victory and end the team's five-game losing streak. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with a game-high 31 points on top of seven points, three rebounds and four blocked shots, while Jabari Parker had an impressive all-around game himself, recording 28 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and three steals in 39 minutes. The two also combined to shoot a combined 22-of-36 from the field on a night where the entire team was finding their stroke. Overall, Milwaukee shot a ridicluous 58.8 percent from the field and 47.8 percent from behind the arc; numbers the very efficient Rockets couldn't even match.

As for those Rockets, they did still shoot the ball very well in the loss, hitting 40 percent of their shots from behind the arc 50 percent from the field overall. James Harden fell a rebound shy of a triple-double, as he finished with a team-high 26 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, but he also recorded 11 turnovers. Additionally, a big storyline headed into Monday's matchup was the return of Wisconsin-born Sam Dekker to his home state fresh off a career-high 30 point performance in his first career start. Monday did not go as well for the young Rocket in his return to the bench, however, as he managed just four points on 2-of-7 shooting in 16 minutes.

Up next, the Bucks will stay home Wednesday to take on the 76ers, while the Rockets will head to Boston on Wednesday to play the Celtics.

												Despite the absence of star Anthony Davis, 49 points from Kyrie Irving, and a triple-double from LeBron James, the host New Orleans Pelicans shocked the reigning champion Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday, 124-122.

The Pelicans (18-27) bounced back from a 29-point home loss to the league-worst Brooklyn Nets on Friday in a surprising manner, beating the defending champions despite the absence of their best player.  Despite Davis (knee) sitting on the bench, New Orleans came out incredibly strong in the first half, establishing a 20-point lead by halftime.  Point guard Jrue Holiday and Terrence Jones shot a combined 17-of-19 in the half and scored 22 points each.  Jones finished with a team-high 36 to go with 11 rebounds, two steals and three blocks.  Holiday, meanwhile, scored 33 with 10 assists, three steals, and two blocks.  Although the game proved to be a tale of two halves, New Orleans managed to hold on to its lead for the entirety of the game, despite the close final score.  

The Cavaliers (30-13) may be looking for answers after an unexpected outcome in New Orleans.  The Eastern Conference's top team is now 5-6 in its last 11 games and is trending downwards despite strong play from its stars.  It would have been hard for Cleveland's big three to perform much better than they did on Monday, as Kyrie Irving scored 49 points, the third-highest mark of his career.  LeBron James scored 26 and finished with a triple-double, and Kevin Love finished with 22 points and 15 rebounds.  In the end, it was weak bench play that sunk the defending champs.  The Cavs' second unit combined for just 13 points on the night.

Cleveland will host Sacramento on Wednesday, while New Orleans will host the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers 109-103 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday. 

Carmelo Anthony finally got a game winning jumper to fall after a handful of failed attempts though January, and the Derrick Rose assisted baseline fadeaway with :23 remaining in the fourth quarter was enough for New York (20-26) to come away with a road victory. The Pacers (22-22) made one crucial error that put the game away for the Knicks, as Myles Turner mishandled a pass resulting in a turnover following Anthony's go-ahead jumper. Courtney Lee was able to add on to the Knicks lead with seconds remaining from the free throw line to put the game away for good. 

Myles Turner had a series on the defensive end of the floor where he blocked a Derrick Rose transition layup and then followed up by going coast-to-coast to put back a misfired shot from the Pacers. Save for Turner's costly error at the end of the game, the young Indiana center went on to score 22 points and grab 10 rebounds, to go along with two blocks. Paul George led all scorers in the contest with 31 points on 11-of-24 shooting, while Jeff Teague scored seven points, dished out seven assists and grabbed four rebounds. 

Anthony led the Knicks in scoring with 26 points on 9-of-17 shooting, in addition to two assists and five boards. Kristaps Porzingis fouled out of the game late in the fourth quarter, which went along with the rough night of eight points on 11 shots.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Utah Jazz 97-95 at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday. 

Russell Westbrook buried a 20-foot jumper with :01 remaining to put the Thunder up two points with barely enough time for Alec Burkes to miss the three point attempt, which put an end to Utah's (29-17) six game winning streak. The Thunder (26-19) improved to 11-13 on the road, while Westbrook notched his 22nd triple-double of the season. 

The back and forth affair was kept close from start to finish, and the Thunder did not let the Jazz run away with a lead towards the end of the second quarter, as Oklahoma City ripped off a 12-1 run to go into the half down just three points. Gordon Hayward did bury a three pointer to pull the Jazz even with just over :10 remaining, but Hayward left just a few too many seconds left on the clock. 

Westbrook finished with 38 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists on 11-of-29 shooting, while Victor Oladipo and Enes Kanter were the only other Thunder players to score in double figures, as each went for 18 points and 14 points, respectively. The Jazz spread their scoring out amongst both the starters and the bench, as players like Hayward went for a team high 17 points, Derrick Favors scored 10 points and Alec Burkes was good for 13 points off the bench. 

Next up, the Jazz play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Thunder visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Orlando Magic, 118-98, at Amway Center on Sunday afternoon. 

The Warriors (38-6) are particularly renowned for being lethal within the friendly confines of Oracle Arena, which often overshadows their considerable potency on the road. That was on full display Sunday, as the Splash Bros. made a rather spectacular appearance in Central Florida. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson each drained seven three-pointers -- becoming the only pair of teammates in NBA history to accomplish the feat in the same game more than once -- on the way to respective totals of 27 and 21 points, spearheading a rather comfortable victory. Their efforts helped overcome 18 team turnovers overall, as the Warriors were able to post 47.2 percent success rate from the field and 45.2 percent figure from three-point range. They also outworked the Magic (18-28) down low, outrebounding their hosts by a 52-41 margin.

Curry's point total paced the Warriors, and he supplemented it with six assists and four rebounds. Thompson five boards and an assist to his aforementioned 21 points. Kevin Durant turned in a modest effort by his standards, tallying a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included six assists, three steals and two blocks. Zaza Pachulia had a strong all-around afternoon, totaling 14 points, five rebounds, an assist and two steals. Draymond Gree provided just six points but hauled in 10 boards, while Javale McGee (13 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal) and Patrick McCaw (10 points, one rebound, one assist) were productive off the bench.

Elfrid Payton paced the Magic with a 23-point, 10-assist double-double that also included four rebounds and a steal. Nikola Vucevic and C.J. Watson were next with a pair of 12-point efforts, with the former also supplying four rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block, and the latter dishing out four assists, hauling in a pair of boards and recording two steals as well. Jeff Green and Bismack Biyombo led the reserves with matching 12-point tallies, with the latter also notably bringing down 14 rebounds and posting a trio of blocks. 

The Warriors continue their trek through the Sunshine State with a visit to the Miami Heat on Monday night, while the Magic are home against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday evening.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 122-73, at American Airlines Center on Sunday. 

There aren't many games as lopsided as this in the NBA, as this was a 30-point deficit for the entirety of the second half. The second quarter is when Dallas did their damage, as they won that quarter, 38-11. The rebounding and assisting margins were particularly one-sided, with the Mavericks recording 49 rebounds and 27 assists, while the Lakers snatched down just 32 rebounds and handed out 11 assists. Dallas shot 49 percent from the field, while Los Angeles shot just 38 percent. 

The Lakers (16-32) have really struggled over the last two months and this 49-point loss may be the low point. No starter scored in double figures for Los Angeles, as they combined for just 37 points. Julius Randle was the only productive starter, as he accrued nine points, six rebounds and four assists on 4-of-4 from the field. Lou Williams led the team in scoring, dropping 15 points off the bench. Brandon Ingram really struggled, as he totaled six points and one rebound on 2-of-12 shooting in 36 minutes of action. The Lakers will look to play better on Wednesday when they play the Portland Trail Blazers on the road

The Mavericks (15-29) are now within four games of the eight-seed in the west, as they continue to revive their season. Seth Curry led the starters in scoring, collecting 14 points, two rebounds and three assists. Deron Williams tallied 13 points, five rebounds and eight assists in just 26 minutes of action. Dirk Nowitzki and Wesley Matthews also scored 13 points a piece. Justin Anderson led the team in scoring, providing 19 points, five rebounds and two assists off the bench. Dallas will look to keep rolling on Wednesday, when they host the New York Knicks for their next game.

												The visiting Phoenix Suns took down the host Toronto Raptors on Sunday, 115-103.

Phoenix (15-29) has now won two straight and has seen excellent play from its young backcourt.  Sophomore shooting guard Devin Booker followed up 26 points on Saturday with 20 against Toronto, including five three-pointers.  Of course, Booker's excellent play was nothing compared to point guard Eric Bledsoe, who dropped 40 points and dished out 13 assists.  Bledsoe shot 11-of-17 and was a perfect 14-of-14 on free-throws.  Strong shooting was the story of the night for Phoenix, as the team shot over 50 percent from the field and knocked down almost 93 percent of its free-throws.  In addition to strong offensive play, Bledsoe played a role in containing the powerful Toronto backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, who shot just 11-of-34 on the night.

Toronto (28-16) was demolished by the Hornets on Friday and was unable to rebound from the loss on Sunday afternoon.  In what was a surprising turn, both of Toronto's All-Star guards struggled, as the two normal top scorers made just 11 shots for 34 points.  Lowry had a particularly tough performance, shooting just 1-of-9 from beyond the arc.  The Raptors as a whole struggled from the field about as much as the Suns succeeded, as the team finished shooting under 40 percent on the night.  In particular, Toronto went ice cold in the fourth quarter, getting outscored by 15 points in the period.  

The Raptors will host the Spurs on Tuesday, while the Suns will host the Timberwolves.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Boston Celtics, 127-123, in overtime at TD Garden on Saturday afternoon.

The Blazers (19-27) checked in to Saturday with only seven road wins in 25 tries this season, and appeared to be facing particularly long odds against a Celtics (26-17) squad that had won seven of their past nine contests. However, a strong third quarter helped Portland catch Boston after they'd faced a 65-56 deficit at the half, and they appeared poised for a hard-fought victory when Damian Lillard drained a pair of free throws with 10 seconds remaining. Terry Rozier turned the tables just two seconds later, though, making a 27-foot three-point jumper off a Marcus Smart assist to knot matters up at 113. Following a Lillard missed step-back jumper as time expired, the two teams headed to an extra period. The Celtics gained a temporary 118-117 advantage with 1:23 remaining in overtime after an Isaiah Thomas three-pointer, but another pair of Lillard free throws with a second left sealed the victory.

C.J. McCollum led the way for Portland with 35 points, three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Lillard provided 28 points, seven assists, a rebound and a block. Meyers Leonard led the bench with 17 points, four boards and a steal. Evan Turner filled out the stat sheet with 12 points, four rebounds, four assists, two blocks and a steal. Mason Plumlee generated 10-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included eight assists and a steal. Al-Farouq Aminu was productive in a reserve role as well, tallying 11 points, seven boards, a steal and a block.

The Celtics saw Thomas score a game-high 41 points, which he supplemented with six assists and three rebounds. Al Horford and Marcus Smart posted matching 17-point efforts, with the former adding nine rebounds and five assists, and the latter supplying six rebounds, six assists and two steals. Jae Crowder totaled 16 points, four rebounds, two assists and a steal. Rozier led the second unit with 15 points, three boards and three assists, while Kelly Olynyk was also productive in a reserve role with 10 points, eight rebounds and an assist.

The Trail Blazers head back to home to await the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night, while the Celtics head to the Nation's Capital to tangle with the Washington Wizards on Tuesday evening.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Washington Wizards, 113-112, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Saturday evening. 

The Wizards (23-20) mounted a furious comeback over the final 12 minutes after entering the fourth quarter with a 98-82 deficit. The Wizards outscored the Pistons (21-24) by a 30-15 margin during the period, but still ultimately came up short due to a heads-up play at the end of the game by Marcus Morris. The game-winning sequence began with a Bradley Beal block of a Tobias Harris' 23-foot three-point jumper with four seconds left. Harris managed an offensive rebound and hoisted another shot attempt, which also misfired. However, Morris was in position to turn the miss into a game-winning tip-in basket, sending the Pistons to their third straight victory.

John Wall co-led Washington with a 19-point, 10-assist double-double that also included eight rebounds and two steals. Markieff Morris also went for 19 points and added nine rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Beal produced 17 points, five boards, four assists, two steals and a block. Marcin Gortat generated 12 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Otto Porter posted 11 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Jason Smith paced the second unit with 16 points, four boards and a steal. Kelly Oubre, Jr. was also productive as a reserve, supplying 11 points, four rebounds and two steals.

Maurice Morris not only was the hero on the night, but also paced the Pistons with a 25-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and a steal. Reggie Jackson was next with 19 points, eight assists, three rebounds and a steal. Harris followed with a near double-double of 18 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Reggie Bullock supplied nine points, five rebounds and an assist. Jon Leuer led the bench with 10 points, five rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Stanley Johnson, Arron Baynes and Ish Smith were also highly productive with a trio of nine-point efforts as reserves. 

The Wizards head to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Monday night, while the Pistons remain home to tangle with the Kings on Monday evening.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-105, at Spectrum Center on Saturday. 

The Nets (9-34) had to have come in to Saturday's contest with plenty of confidence, having compiled a season-high 143 points against the Pelicans on Friday night. However, the Nets' effort to record a second straight road win was undermined by a highly efficient offensive performance on the part of the Hornets (23-21). Seven Charlotte players hit double digits in the scoring column, and the Hornets reserves contributed a solid 43 points. Brooklyn did come back strong after falling behind by a 28-14 margin after one quarter, but ultimately saw the Hornets pull away in the fourth period. The home team also tallied 47.6 percent shooting overall, including 48.3 percent from three-point range. 

Brooklyn was led by Brook Lopez's 24 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Bojan Bogdanovic totaled 16 points, three rebounds and three assists. Sean Kilpatrick supplied 13 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals, whileTrevor Booker provided eight points, nine rebounds and a pair of steals. Quincy Acy continued the strong start to his Nets tenure by leading the second unit with 14 points, four rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block. Randy Foye was also a solid contributor off the bench, generating 11 points, five assists and two rebounds. 

Michael Kidd-Gilchrist co-led the Hornets with a 17-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included an assist and two blocks. Ramon Sessions matched Kidd-Gilchrist's scoring total and supplemented it with two rebounds and two assists. Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum chimed in with matching 16-point efforts, with the former adding six assists and four rebounds, and the latter hauling in nine boards, six assists and four steals. Cody Zeller had a near double-double with 12 points, nine rebounds, three assists and a block. Marco Belinelli registered 14 points, five assists and a rebound over 22 minutes, and Frank Kaminsky III was also productive in a reserve role, compiling 10 points, two rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 110-93, at Philips Arena on Saturday.

Atlanta were expected to win this game easily and they did just that by leading for the final 30-plus minutes. Turnovers were Philadelphia's downfall, as they committed 21 of them, while forcing just 13 from Atlanta. The Hawks did work in the interior, as they won the rebounding battle, 48-38 and outscored the Sixers, 42-30, in the paint. Shooting was also a key difference, with Atlanta shooting 50 percent, while the Sixers hit just 42 percent of their shots.

The Sixers (15-27) have the worst plus-minus in the NBA without Joel Embiid in the lineup and losses like this show how much of a difference he makes. Ersan Ilyasova led Philly in scoring, tallying 21 points, three rebounds and four assists. Robert Covington scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds en route to a double-double. T.J. McConnell stuffed the stat sheet by providing eight points, six rebounds, 11 assists and three steals. On deck for the Sixers is a home matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.  

The Hawks (26-18) have now won nine of their last 11 games, as they continue to climb up the standings. Paul Millsap was the player of the game, collecting 22 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks on 9-of-14 shooting. Dwight Howard also recorded a double-double, totaling 13 points, 15 rebounds and three assists. Dennis Schroeder scored 15 points, while handing out a team-high nine assists. Tim Hardaway Jr. was a nice spark off the bench, providing 12 points, three rebounds, six assists and two steals.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the New York Knicks, 107-105, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.

Although both teams entered the game with losing records, they engaged in an exciting and tightly-contested offensive affair through three quarters. Both defenses clamped down in the final 12 minutes, however, and the Knicks (19-26) held a tenuous 105-102 edge with 1:32 remaining. That's when the Suns' Devin Booker went to work, draining two free throws to bring Phoenix within one, and then vaulting them back into the lead with a 24-foot three-point jumper with 31 seconds left. Carmelo Anthony subsequently failed to pull the win out of the Knicks at the buzzer when his 25-foot three-point attempt failed to find the net.

Booker's 26 points led the way for the Suns (14-29), a total he supplemented with two assists, a rebound, a steal and a block. Eric Bledsoe followed with 23 points, seven assists, five rebounds and a block. Rookie Marquese Chriss contributed 15 points, five boards, three steals and a block. Tyson Chandler generated a modest nine points but hauled in 16 boards. P.J. Tucker paced the bench with 15 points, three rebounds, two assists and three steals, while Brandon Knight was productive as well with 11 points, five rebounds, two assists and a steal. 

Anthony paced the Knicks with a game-high 31 points, seven rebounds, six assists and a steal. Derrick Rose was right behind him with 26 points, five assists and three rebounds. Kristaps Porzingis managed 14 points, two assists and a rebound. Courtney Lee celebrated a return to the starting lineup with 13 points, four boards, three assists and a block. Joakim Noah went scoreless over 20 minutes but did haul in 15 boards, dish out three assists and haul in a block. 

The Suns visit the Toronto Raptors on Sunday evening, while the Knicks visit the Indiana Pacers on Monday evening as well.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 109-97, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday,

Miami haven't had many dominant wins this season, but they led for the final 40 minutes here in an impressive victory. Shooting was the glaring difference in the game, with the Heat hitting 53 percent of their shots, while Milwaukee went just 42 percent from the field. Miami did most of their damage in the first half, as they led 53-43, headed into the locker room. Three-point shooting was decisive as well, with Miami going 13-of-30, with Milwaukee hitting just 6-of-18 from long range.

The Bucks (20-23) played this game with Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon coming off the bench for disciplinary issues and that clearly put them too far behind the eight-ball to overcome. Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load though, accumulating 24 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two steals. Parker came off the bench to provide 16 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Brogdon didn't have as much success off the bench, scoring four points on 1-of-10 from the field. Matthew Dellavedova started at point guard and tallied 15 points and seven assists.

The Heat (14-30) have now won three-straight games, as the balance beam is evening up with their abundance of close losses. Dion Waiters tied a career-high with 33 points on 12-of-19 shooting, adding three rebounds and three assists to his tally. Goran Dragic was second on the team, dropping 25 points, to go along with six assists. Hassan Whiteside recorded a 16-point, 15-rebound double-double. Wayne Ellington dropped 15 points off the bench, while James Johnson totaled seven points and six assists off the pine as well.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies, 119-95, at FedEx Forum on Saturday. 

It's rare to see Memphis dominated in their home building, but that was just the case here in this near wire-to-wire win for Houston. The Rockets actually led by 10 after the first quarter and never relinquished the lead from there. Shooting was the difference in the game, with the Rockets shooting 51 percent, while they held the Grizzlies to just 37 percent. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with the two teams matching in turnovers, while Houston won the assist battle, 27-19. Defensive rebounding was dominant for the Rockets as well, as they snatched down 40 defensive boards to Memphis' 27.

The Rockets (34-13) have been stifling teams with their rocket launcher mentality and dominating wins over teams like the Grizzlies show just how good they've become. James Harden was once again the catalyst, accumulating 29 points, six rebounds, 10 assists, three steals and two blocks. Sam Dekker got his first start and dropped a career-high 30 points on 12-of-19 shooting. No other starter scored in double figures, but Eric Gordon led the bench with 21 points, three rebounds and five assists. The Rockets will play the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday for their next game.

The Grizzlies (26-20) live and die by their defense and they simply didn't have enough to stop this potent Rockets attack in this blowout loss. Marc Gasol did all he could for Memphis, leading the team with 32 points, five rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Mike Conley was second on the team, finishing with 15 points, four rebounds and six assists. The bench really struggled, as the six bench players combined to go 8-of-29 from the field. The Grizzlies will be off until Wednesday, when they host the Toronto Raptors for their next matchup.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers in overtime, 118-115, at Quicken Loans Arena on Saturday.

This was a game that was expected to be close throughout and these elite teams didn't disappoint in this overtime thriller. In fact, there were 13 ties and 15 lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 11 points. Free-throw shooting killed Cleveland, as they went 12-of-22 from the charity stripe, while the Spurs went 12-of-14. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with the Spurs recording 32 assists to 13 turnovers, while the Cavaliers committed 18 turnovers to just 25 assists. 

The Spurs (34-9) are now 18-4 on the road, as they continue their quiet success. Kawhi Leonard got to six-straight games with at least 30 points, as he set a career-high with 41 points in this win. He also added six rebounds and five assists on 14-of-29 from the field. LaMarcus Aldridge was second on the team, accruing 16 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. David Lee started for Pau Gasol and recorded a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double. Patty Mills was a nice spark off the bench, providing 13 points, three rebounds and five assists. 

The Cavaliers (30-12) have now lost four of their last six, with this being the toughest loss in the bunch. LeBron James did contribute 29 points, six rebounds and seven assists, but he committed seven turnovers in the defeat. Kyrie Irving also had 29 points, adding three rebounds, nine assists and two steals to his tally. Kevin Love returned from a one-game absence to total 13 points, 11 rebounds and three assists. Tristan Thompson also record a double-double, amassing 14 points and 12 rebounds.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the visiting Los Angeles Clippers 123-98, at Pepsi Center on Saturday evening. 

The Nuggets led wire to-wire as they controlled this one right from the start. Denver took a nine-point lead after one quarter and went on to win each of the remaining three quarters. They managed to build up a 35-point lead by the mid-point of the fourth quarter, which was their biggest lead at any point this season. 

Six players scored in double digits for the Nuggets (18-24), but none of them scored more than 20, as this was truly a team effort. Nikola Jokic had the line of the night for the Nuggets, as he double-doubled with 19 points and 10 rebounds, in 21 minutes. Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler and Will Barton each added 18 points, to help push the Nuggets to a solid win. Unfortunately for Denver, Emmanuel Mudiay went down early in the game, and left with an aggravated back. He is ruled out for the Nuggets' next game on Sunday. The Nuggets will look to build off this win, as they head straight to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Sunday, for their second game in as many nights. 

Meanwhile, the Clippers (29-16) struggled in this one, shooting only 41.7 percent from the field. Nonetheless, five players scored in double digits for Los Angeles, including DeAndre Jordan, who finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds. Marreese Speights was the high-point man for the Clippers, as he finished with 18 points, in 28 minutes as a starter. The Clippers hope to have Blake Griffin back soon, as they look ahead to their next game, which will take place in Atlanta on Monday. It will be the second game of their current five-game road trip.

												The Utah Jazz hung on to earn their sixth straight win, as they defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers 109-100, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday evening. 

The Jazz started out with a strong 34-21 first quarter and led 60-50 at halftime. Paul George was ejected in the fourth quarter after picking up a technical foul and his sixth personal. The Jazz were then able to stay on track and earn a solid home win. 

Four players scored in double digits for the Jazz (29-16), highlighted by solid performances from George Hill and Gordon Hayward. Hill led the way with a game-high 30 points, to go along with six rebounds and five assists, while Hayward finished with 27 points on solid 8-of-13 shooting. Rudy Gobert was huge late in the game, and finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds, as he helped the Jazz seal the deal, with some key offensive boards. Alec Burks had one of his best games of the season, as he finished with 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting, and four rebounds, in 19 minutes off the bench. The Jazz will look to extend their streak, as they play host to the Thunder on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the Pacers (22-21) fell short despite five players scoring in double digits. Thaddeus Young, Jeff Teague and Paul George each had a team-high 19 points, while Monta Ellis added 15 off the bench. Myles Turner was the only other player to score in double digits, as he chipped in 13, on 5-of-9 shooting. The Pacers shot 50.6 percent from the field and 50 percent from long range, but lacked the closing power, as their star Paul George was ejected. This marks the second straight loss for the Pacers, who will look to bounce back, as they play host to the Knicks on Monday.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the visiting Sacramento Kings 102-99, at United Center on Saturday evening. 

The Bulls literally stole one from the Kings, as Dwyane Wade came up with two huge steals in the last minute to seal the deal for Chicago. First Wade stole the ball then raced down floor but missed a dunk to go ahead by two, however a foul was called against DeMarcus Cousins on the play to put Wade at the line. Wade missed the first of two free throws but hit the second to put his squad up 100-99. The Kings then took a timeout with 14 seconds on the clock. Out of the timeout, they inbounded the ball to Cousins at the three-point line, and he proceeded to take it into the paint, but as he was backing down his defender, Wade swooped in for the game saving steal, and raced away, passing the ball ahead for a dunk which put the game out of reach.  

The Bulls (22-23) really needed this one, as they were coming off two ugly losses. Wade had a rough start to the game but ended up coming through, with a team-high 30 points, to go along with six rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals. Three other players scored in double digits for the Bulls, led by Jimmy Butler's 23 points. Paul Zipser came up big for Chicago, as he chipped in 13 points on 4-of-8 shooting, in 23 minutes off the bench, while Nikola Mirotic added 11 points off the bench. The Bulls will look to build on this win, as they head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, the Kings (18-27) were dealt a heartbreaker, as the foul on Wade's would-be go-ahead dunk was a questionable one, and will likely be mentioned in Sunday's L2M report. DeMarcus Cousins did all he could to give his team the edge, as he was the only player to score in double digits for the Kings. Cousins finished with a game-high 42 points, to go along with 14 rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal, in 35 minutes. The Kings will have to put the past behind them as they move on to Detroit, where they will face the third game of their current eight-game road trip.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 93-92, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday night.

The Sixers (15-26) have shown notable improvement this season, in large part thanks to former first-round pick Joel Embiid finally being at full health. They entered Friday in the midst of their best stretch in years, as they'd secured victories in seven of their previous nine games. With a Trail Blazers (18-27) squad that had won only seven of 24 road games coming in to town, that streak had a chance to extend even further. However, after an opening 12 minutes that saw Portland ambush their hosts by a 33-22 margin, the Sixers were decidedly behind the proverbial eight-ball. In previous seasons, this obstacle would have been enough to put Philadelphia away for good. These seem to be different times, however, and the Sixers came roaring out of intermission to outscore their visitors, 27-15, in the third quarter. That set up a nip-and-tuck final period that saw the game come down to the final seconds, when Robert Covington made a 28-foot three-point jumper with four ticks remaining to send the home team to their eighth win in the last 10 contests. 

The Trail Blazers were led by Damian Lillard's 30 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, an assist and a steal. C.J. McCollum had a down game by his standards, posting a modest 16 points on 5-of-18 shooting. He added four rebounds, four assists and three steals. Mason Plumlee generated 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists, three blocks and a steal. Noah Vonleh tallied 10 points, five rebounds and a steal. Al-Farouq Aminu went for a near double-double off the bench with nine points, nine boards, one assist and one steal.

Ersan Ilyasova paced the Sixers with 24 points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Covington totaled 22 points overall, along with six rebounds, a steal and a block. Embiid totaled an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double that also featured five assists and four blocks. However, he was forced from the game after 22 minutes with a left knee contusion. T.J. McConnell filled out the stat sheet with eight points, five assists and four rebounds. 

The Blazers head to Boston to take on the Celtics on Saturday afternoon, while the Sixers head down south to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday evening.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the visiting Toronto Raptors 113-78, at Time Warner Cable Arena on Friday evening. 

The Hornets led right from the start, as they led 26-18 after the first quarter. The Raptors managed to close the gap to one point but Charlotte pulled away again before half. The Hornets then came out and dominated the third quarter, behind a dominant showing from Kemba Walker. The Hornets outscored the Raptors 58-30 in the second half, en route to the dominating victory. 

This marked the Raptors (28-15) lowest point total of the season, as they were not able to match the Hornets' intensity from the start. Kyle Lowry was the high-point man for Toronto, with 24 points on 7-of-18 shooting, while DeMar DeRozan followed up with 23 points on 8-of-17 shooting. The only other player to score in double digits for the Raptors was Jonas Valanciunas, who finished with 11 points and six rebounds. This marks the second straight loss for the Raptors, who will remain second place in the East. They will look to turn things around, as they head back home to play host to the Suns on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, the Hornets (22-21) have bounced back from a five-game losing streak by winning their second straight game. This was a huge win for Charlotte, against a solid Eastern Conference opponent. Kemba Walker was unstoppable, as he led his team with 32 points on 11-of-16 shooting, including a blazing 6-of-9 from long range. Five other players scored in double digits for the Hornets, with Frank Kaminsky III standing as the second-highest scorer, with 16 points on 5-of-10 shooting, in 27 minutes off the bench.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 112-96, at Amway Center on Friday night.

Both teams came in to Friday with three-game losing streaks, and the Magic (18-27) had the added obstacle of being down their top two shooting guards in Evan Fournier (heel) and Jodie Meeks (thumb). However, a balanced offensive effort that saw seven players tally double-digit scoring and a strong defensive performance propelled Orlando to victory. They forced the Bucks (20-22) into 12 turnovers, while also limiting them to 40.5 percent shooting overall. The third quarter was pivotal for the Magic, as they outscored Milwaukee by a 29-19 margin during the period to help them pull away.

The Bucks were paced by Jabari Parker, who managed a game-high 25 points, six rebounds and six assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo provided a 17-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included five assists and a steal. Malcolm Brogdon posted 16 points, five assists, two rebounds and a steal. John Henson provided eight points, five rebounds, two assists and a block, while Tony Snell supplied just two points, a rebound, an assist and a steal. Rashad Vaughn registered a bench-leading eight points, two rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

Elfrid Payton led the way for Orlando with 20 points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals. Aaron Gordon was right behind with 17 points, eight boards, three assists and two steals. Serge Ibaka and Nikola Vucevic totaled matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding four rebounds, an assist and two steals, and the latter offering six rebounds and two assists. Jeff Green led the second unit with 18 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. Bismack Biyombo tallied a 13-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included four blocks and a steal. D.J. Augustin managed 10 points, eight assists and a pair of boards. In all, the bench contributed 44 points on the night.

The Bucks head down to South Florida for a Saturday night showdown with the Miami Heat, while the Magic remain home for a showdown with the Golden State Warriors on Sunday afternoon.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Sacramento Kings, 107-91, at FedEx Forum on Friday night. 

After a shaky first quarter, the Grizzlies (26-19) put their best foot forward on both ends of the floor Friday, showing while they remain a solid Western Conference power season after season. Memphis was surprisingly outscored by a 23-15 margin over the first 12 minutes, but they came back to post 68 points over the subsequent two periods to pull away. They held the Kings (16-26) to 40.8 percent shooting overall and a paltry 20.7 percent from three-point range, while also boasting five double-digit scorers. Two of their most dependable veterans, Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph, led the way on the first and second units with respective tallies of 28 and 20 points, and they also helped limit DeMarcus Cousins to a modest 19 points and 10 rebounds.

Cousins added two assists and a block to his team-high scoring total. Garrett Temple went for 14 points, three rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal. However, no other starter managed double-digit scoring, as Kosta Koufos (eight points, two rebounds), Arron Afflalo (five points, two rebounds, four steals) and Darren Collison (four points, four assists, three rebounds) significantly underwhelmed. Ty Lawson led the second unit with 13 points, five assists, four rebounds and a steal. Sacramento's bench contributed a collective 41 points, as Anthony Tolliver, Willie Cauley-Stein and Matt Barnes all scored between six and eight points to back up Lawson's output.

Gasol added nine boards, four assists and a steal to his game-high scoring haul. Randolph hauled in 10 rebounds and dished out two assists to his 20-point tally. Mike Conley generated a full stat line of 16 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Tony Allen posted a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double, while James Ennis registered 10 points, six boards, three assists and a pair of blocks. Vince Carter provided 11 points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals.in 22 minutes off the bench. 

The Kings next head to the Windy City for a Saturday night tilt against the Chicago Bulls, while the Grizzlies remain home to do battle with the Houston Rockets on Saturday evening as well.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans 143-114, at Smoothie King Center on Friday evening. 

The Pelicans led after one quarter but the Nets surged back in the second, outscoring the Pelicans by 15 in the second quarter, to take a 66-54 lead at halftime. The Nets then continued to dominated in the second half, outscoring the Pelicans 77-60 in the final two quarters to cruise to their highest point total of the season. 

This marks only the second road win over the season for the Nets (9-33), as they now move to 2-18 on the road. Brook Lopez led the way for Brooklyn, as usual, with 23 points on 8-of-15 shooting, to go along with eight rebounds, three assists and three blocks, in 24 minutes. Bojan Bogdanovic also chipped in 23 points, to go along with his six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 27 minutes. Six other players scored in double digits for the Nets, while five of those players came off the bench. Rookie Caris LeVert was the next highest scorer, as he chipped in 17 points on 6-of-6 shooting, including 3-of-3 from long range, to go along with six assists, and five rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench. The Nets still remain at the bottom of the East, all but out of any playoff contention, but they can be proud of this solid road win nonetheless. The Nets will see if they can keep rolling as they visit Charlotte on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, the Pelicans (17-27) fell short in a disappointing effort, as they shot 41 percent from the field, while allowing the Nets to shoot 57.8 percent. Five players scored in double digits, led by Anthony Davis, who finished with 22 points on 10-of-17 shooting, in 27 minutes. Dante Cunningham chipped in 14 points to go along with seven rebounds, while Jrue Holiday added 12 points and eight assists. The Pelicans can not afford to lose any more games to teams with worse records than their own, as they need every win they can get to remain in contention for the eighth spot in the West. They will look to bounce back but will have to do so against a tough opponent, as they play host to the Cavaliers on Monday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Houston Rockets 125-108, at Toyota Center on Friday evening. 

The Warriors won the first three quarters, to take a 20-point lead into the final frame, where they scored 26 points to make sure they stayed on top. The season series is now even at one a piece, as they Warriors were able to get revenge for the loss the Rockets handed them at Oracle Arena, earlier in the season.  

This marks the sixth straight win for the Warriors (37-6), as they remain comfortably at the top of the West. Kevin Durant was the high-point man in the contest, as he finished with 32 points on 12-of-19 shooting, in 34 minutes. Golden State's four other starters also scored in double digits, while Stephen Curry was the next highest contributor, with 24 points, to go along with seven assists, in 33 minutes. Draymond Green filled the stat sheet as he added 15 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, three blocks and one steal, in 33 minutes. The Warriors are 17-3 on the road and will look to keep rolling, as they move on to Orlando to face the second game of their current four-game road trip. 

Meanwhile, the Rockets (33-13) struggled from long range, which for them usually means a loss, considering how many of their shots come from there. They only hit 7-of-35 from distance, but still managed to shoot 44 percent from the field overall. James Harden was quiet, finishing with only 17 points, while going 0-of-5 from long range. Harden added 11 assists and seven rebounds, but struggled to control the ball, as he gave up seven turnovers. Clint Capela was the high-point man for the Rockets, as he finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds, in 21 minutes off the bench. The Rockets remain comfortably in third place in the West, but will have to get back on track, as they head right out to Memphis, where they face the Grizzlies on Saturday.

												The host Atlanta Hawks beat the Chicago Bulls on Friday, 102-93.

Atlanta (25-18) has now won ten of its last 12 games after escaping with a win on Friday.  The Hawks entered the fourth quarter with a massive 30-point lead but simply laid down, allowing Chicago to come within five points of the lead.  Atlanta followed an impressive 65-point first half with just 37 in the second, utterly collapsing and luckily squeezing out the win.  While the game was incredibly turnover-heavy on both sides, Atlanta was able to emerge victorious in large part due to their pestering defense.  The team stole the ball a whopping 16 times.  Point guard Dennis Schroeder was in top form in particular in the first half, as he ended up finishing the night with 25 points on 11-of-14 shooting.

Chicago (21-23) has had an extremely hit-or-miss season thus far, and came away with another miss on Friday.  While the Hawks' second-half struggles may have been massive, Chicago's start to the game was even rougher.  The Bulls finished the first half down 29 points, an almost insurmountable deficit, after scoring only 35 in two quarters.  It was a strange off night for Chicago's starting five, as the starters combined for only 13 rebounds and 42 points.  The best among them was superstar Jimmy Butler, who shot 6-of-8 for 19 points but came away with no rebounds and only three assists.

On Saturday, the Hawks will host the surging Philadelphia 76ers while Chicago will see the Sacramento Kings.

												The visiting Utah Jazz took down the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, 112-107 in overtime.

Utah (28-16) won its fifth straight game on Friday after taking down the Mavericks in Dallas.  Despite the absence of Rodney Hood (knee), the Jazz saw a solid night on the offensive end.  A big piece of the Jazz's success was center Rudy Gobert, who had career highs with 27 points and 25 rebounds, 10 of which came on the offensive end.  Gobert, the anchor of Utah's tough defense, added two blocks.  Rebounding proved to be Utah's biggest edge over Dallas, as the Jazz held a 53-42 advantage on the glass.  The Jazz also saw 26 points from star forward Gordon Hayward.

Dallas (14-29) had also seen strong play coming into Friday's matchup, having won three of its last four games. The team saw a well-rounded performance on Friday, as seven players managed to score in double digits.  Surprisingly, one of the weak links in Dallas's offense was veteran Dirk Nowitzki, who scored only three points and shot just 1-of-13.  Nowitzki did make up for some of the Mavericks' weakness on the boards, however, as he pulled down ten rebounds on the night.  Forward Harrison Barnes led the team with 19 points.

The Jazz will host the Pacers on Saturday, while the Mavericks will see the Lakers on Sunday.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers took down the Indiana Pacers on Friday, 108-96. 

Los Angeles (16-31) snapped a five-game losing streak by taking down Indiana on Friday.  One of the keys to the Lakers' success was a strong performance on the glass, as Los Angeles finished with a 51-37 advantage in the rebounding column.  As has often been the case for the Lakers this season, it was the bench, rather than the starters, that led the offensive charge for the team.  Sixth man Lou Williams scored a team-high 27 points while knocking down four three-pointers.  For the team, three-point shooting was a strength, as they knocked down 14 shots from deep.

Indiana (22-20) had been 7-1 in its previous eight games before falling short in Los Angeles.  The Pacers fell behind early in the second half after being unable to run with the Lakers' strong three-point shooters.  All-Star forward Paul George led the team with 21 points, also pulling down six rebounds.  The team was unable to contend on the boards, however, with center Myles Turner pulling down only four rebounds on the night.  Big man Al Jefferson, though, came through with 20 points off the bench.  

The Pacers will play in Utah on Saturday, while the Lakers will visit Dallas on Sunday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Phoenix Suns, 118-103, at Quicken Loans Arena on Thursday.

The Cavaliers (30-11) learned earlier in the day that they wouldn't have Kevin Love at their disposal to attempt to help them stop a rare slide that had seen them lose three of their last four, as the star forward would be sidelined with his lower back ailment. However, the other two members of the Big Three, along with some help from trusty veteran Channing Frye, helped insure that the Cavs got back on track against the defensively-challenged Suns (13-29). Irving and James combined for 47 points, and Cleveland was able to post a success rate of 50.6 percent from the field and 44.2 percent from three-point range. On the defensive end, they held the Suns to a 21.1 percent tally from behind the arc and also forced them into 14 turnovers.

Phoenix was led by a pair of 22-point efforts from Eric Bledsoe and Tyson Chandler, with the former adding nine assists, six rebounds and four steals, and the latter hauling in 16 boards, dishing out an assist and recording a block. Devin Booker was right behind with 21 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. T.J. Warren registered 18 points, three rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block. Marquese Chriss rounded out the starting five's night with six points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

Irving's 26 points paced Cleveland, a total he supplemented with four assists, two rebounds and two steals. James generated a near triple-double with 21 points, 15 assists, nine rebounds, two blocks and a steal. Frye led the second unit with an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double, along with two assists and a steal. Iman Shumpert provided 17 points, two boards, an assist, a steal and a block. James Jones, drawing the start for Love, compiled 14 points, two assists and a block. 

The Suns next head to the Big Apple to take on the New York Knicks on Saturday night, while the Cavaliers remain home for a showdown with the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday evening as well.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Dallas Mavericks 99-95 Thursday at AmericanAirlines Arena.

While the Heat (13-30) managed to open up a seven-point lead at the end of the first quarter, but a brutal second quarter, which they lost by 16 points, put their chances of winning against the red-hot Mavericks (14-28), who came in as winners of three straight games, in serious doubt. But Miami managed to gain back the lead and pull away in the second half on the back of yet another great performance from starting point guard Goran Dragic. Dragic finished with a game-high 32 points on 11-of-15 shooting from the field, which included hitting all four of his shots from behind the arc. Tyler Johnson also added yet another solid performance off the bench, scoring an efficient 23 points in 28 minutes as a reserve.

For Dallas, they came just short of extending their win streak to four games despite having a solid all-around team effort. Dirk Nowitzki continues his return to form, as he led the way for the Mavericks with 19 points, while Wesley Matthews added 18 points of his own. Harrison Barnes and Seth Curry each added 15 points, while J.J. Barea added 13 points off the bench, but the other four Mavericks that played Thursday combined to score just 15 points. 

Up next, the Heat will look to extend their win streak to three games against the Bucks on Saturday, while the Mavericks will play again Friday against the Jazz.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the New York Knicks 103-100 Thursday at Madison Square Garden.

Coming off maybe their most impressive win on the season, a road victory against the Celtics, the Knicks (19-25) had an opportunity to really step out of a funk and get on the right track at home. However, John Wall and the Wizards (23-19) ended up being too much for New York on their own home floor. Wall finished with a team-high 29 points, 13 assists, five rebounds and three steals in 37 minutes. Otto Porter Jr. continued his hot streak as well, posting 23 points and six rebounds while going a scorching-hot 6-of-10 from behind the arc. As a team, all things were clicking offensively from the Wizards, with the team as a whole shooting 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from three as they notched their fourth straight victory.

As for the Knicks, it was a disappointing result, especially with the return of Kristaps Porzingis from an Achilles injury. The Latvian came off the bench to score 15 points in 29 minutes, but it was Carmelo Anthony that really kept the team in the team. Anthony finished with a game-high 34 points on 13-of-27 shooting on top of 10 rebounds, while Derrick Rose had his second straight solid game, as he finished with 20 points. In the end, however, it was New York's inability to hit an outside shot that ultimately led to their demise, as they made just seven of their 24 attempts from long range (29 percent).

Up next, the Wizards will look for their fifth straight win against the Pistons on Saturday, while the Knicks will remain home Saturday to take on the Suns.

												The host San Antonio Spurs took down the Denver Nuggets on Thursday, 118-104.

The Spurs (33-9) remain the league's second-ranked team with Thursday's double-digit win.  San Antonio received the unfortunate news on Thursday that veteran big man Pau Gasol had suffered a broken fourth metacarpal bone and will likely miss considerable time.  The Spurs' spirits were lifted on the court, however, as the team earned a strong win.  For the fifth straight game, superstar forward Kawhi Leonard scored at least 30 points, leading the team with 34.  Leonard, who was named an All-Star starter hours before tip-off, played an integral part in the Spurs' third-quarter charge to take a commanding lead.  Five Spurs scored in double digits and the team finished the night shooting over 51 percent in what was a strong offensive outing for the powerful team.

The Nuggets (17-24) had their three-game win streak snapped in San Antonio.  Despite the loss, Denver continued to see promising play from breakout sophomore center Nikola Jokic.  Jokic dominated with a career-high 35 points along with 12 rebounds and four assists.  Guard Will Barton, who once again filled in for an injured Gary Harris, delivered 18 points and dished out seven assists.  However, the middling Nuggets were unable to run with the powerhouse Spurs for the entirety of the game, due in large part to poor shooting from their remaining players.  Denver finished at just 40 percent shooting on the night.

The Spurs will visit Cleveland on Saturday, while Denver will host the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the host Los Angeles Clippers, 104-101, at Staples Center on Thursday.

Despite there being just five ties and four lead changes, this game was close throughout. In fact, no team led by more than 12 points, as this was a single-digit game for well over 40 minutes. Minnesota finally closed things out for the first time all year, as they finished the game on a 11-4 run to cap off their first win within four points. Shooting was the downfall for the Clippers, as they shot 18 percent from three-point range and 54 percent from the free-throw line.

Minnesota (15-28) was 0-10 in games decided by four points or less coming into this matchup, as this big win cracked that ugly spell. Karl-Anthony Towns was the player of the game, accumulating 37 points, 12 rebounds and five assists on 17-of-24 from the field. Andrew Wiggins was just as good, totaling 27 points, four rebounds and four assists. Gorgui Dieng was the only other T'Wolf in double-figures, collecting 13 points and seven rebounds. Ricky Rubio left in the first half with a hip injury and finished the game with no points, four rebounds and four assists. The Timberwolves will host the Denver Nuggets on Sunday for their next game.

Los Angeles (29-15) had to play their first game without Chris Paul (hand) and this could be a sign of things to come. DeAndre Jordan did all he could in the absence of Paul and Blake Griffin though, as he dropped a career-high 29 points to go along with 16 rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Austin Rivers was second on the team, tallying 20 points and two assists before fouling out in the final two minutes. Raymond Felton started for Paul and contributed 10 points, four rebounds and eight assists. The Clippers will be in Denver on Saturday for their next game.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Toronto Raptors, 94-89, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

The Sixers (14-26) have been mocked for some time for the ""Trust the Process"" slogan that has become associated with their seemingly never-ending string of losing seasons. However, that phrase seems to be carrying a little more weight these days, as Philadelphia, behind emerging star Joel Embiid, is starting to make some noise around the league. The latest team to get an up-close look at their improving squad was the Raptors (28-14), which suffered their eighth road loss of the season while seeing Embiid tally 26 points, nine rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. Philadelphia still has plenty of room for improvement despite notching their seventh win in nine games, as they turned the ball over a whopping 22 times. However, they played superb defense, limiting Toronto to 39.5 and 25.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively.

The Raptors were led by DeMar DeRozan, who compiled 25 points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal. Kyle Lowry, who returned from a one-game absence for rest purposes, posted 24 points, four rebounds, four assists, five steals and a block. Jonas Valanciunas generated a modest 10 points but hauled in 16 rebounds and dished out an assist. However, the remainder of the first unit, DeMarre Carroll (scoreless in 23 minutes) and Pascal Siakam (two points) significantly underwhelmed. The bench helped make up for some of the scoring void with a combined 28 points, led by matching eight-point efforts from Terrence Ross and the debuting Jared Sullinger, who also added three rebounds over his 14 minutes on the court. 

Ersan Ilyasova was second behind Embiid on the Sixers with 18 points, five rebounds and two assists. Robert Covington and T.J. McConnell supplied a pair of 10-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block, and the latter posting eight assists, five rebounds and a steal. Gerald Henderson led the second unit with nine points and two rebounds, while Dario Saric was productive as a reserve as well with eight points, nine rebounds, an assist and two blocks.

The Raptors head to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Friday night, while the Sixers remain home to await the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday evening as well.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Memphis Grizzlies,104-101, at Verizon Center on Wednesday.

The Wizards (22-19) have been a true Jekyll and Hyde team this season with respect to their home/road splits, as coming in to Wednesday, they'd managed just four wins in 17  tries away from Verizon Center and a stellar 17-6 record within the friendly confines of their home arena. That trend held true again Wednesday, even against a tough Grizzlies (25-19) squad. John Wall and Otto Porter, Jr. combined for 50 points to lead the way on offense, while on defense, Washington held Memphis to sub-40 percent success rates from both the field and three-point range. 

Memphis' attack was spearheaded by Marc Gasol, who tallied 28 points, seven assists, two rebounds and a block. Mike Conley tallied 20 points, six assists and three rebounds, while also turning the ball over a game-high five times. JaMychal Green managed a 15-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a steal. Vince Carter was next with a bench-leading 12 points, which he supplemented with two boards, an assist and three steals. Tony Allen and Chandler Parsons could only muster a pair of six-point efforts on the first unit.

Wall and Porter had matching 25-point efforts, with the former adding 13 assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block, and the latter providing seven rebounds and a steal. Markieff Morris contributed a 17-point, 12-rebound double-double, along with two assists, a steal and a block. Bradley Beal registered 12 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal over 37 minutes. The sharpshooting guard only went 4-of-14 from the field and 1-of-7 from three-point range, but his two clutch free throws with 14 seconds remaining ended up giving the Wizards a key cushion in their lead. Marcin Gortat mustered a modest seven points but hauled in 11 rebounds. 

The Grizzlies head back home to face the Sacramento Kings on Friday night, while the Wizards head to the Big Apple to tangle with the New York Knicks on Thursday evening.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 107-85, at Spectrum Center on Wednesday.

In a battle between two teams in the midst of losing streaks, the Hornets rode a huge fourth quarter en route to a 22-point win. In fact, Charlotte won the fourth quarter, 28-13. The Hornets defense was huge, as they forced the Blazers to commit 15 turnovers and shoot just 35 percent from the field. They did that damage while dominating the assist ratio, with Charlotte recording 28 assists to Portland's 18. Despite the game being close throughout the first half, Charlotte led for the entirety of the second half. 

The Blazers (18-26) have now lost three-straight games, as their defense continues to let them down. Damian Lillard was a nice bright spot for Portland though, as he tallied 21 points, seven rebounds and six assists. C.J. McCollum was the only other Blazer in double figures, totaling 18 points, two rebounds and four steals. Evan Turner was the best player off the bench, providing eight points, nine rebounds and two assists. On deck for the Blazers is a road matchup against the revived Philadelphia 76ers on Friday. 

The Hornets (21-21) were back home after a nightmare five-game road trip, as they took care of business here to snap a five-game losing streak. Kemba Walker was the player of the game, as he accumulated 23 points, five assists and three steals. Nicolas Batum accrued 17 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, despite committing five turnovers. Roy Hibbert was a nice spark off the bench, dropping 16 points and six rebounds on 7-of-8 from the field. Frank Kaminsky and Marco Belinelli also scored in double figures off the bench, combining for 24 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three steals. The Hornets will host the Toronto Raptors on Friday for their next game											",Charlotte,Hornets,Portland,Trail Blazers,Spectrum Center,18,26,21,21,11.0,26.0,41.0,86.0,14.0,17.0,51.0,28.0,12.0,8.0,29.0,33.0,92.0,11.0,11.0,47.0,17.0,14.0,Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Al-Farouq Aminu,7.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,29,Marvin Williams,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,23,Maurice Harkless,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,27,Cody Zeller,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,25,Mason Plumlee,10.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30,Nicolas Batum,7.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,17.0,6.0,15.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,33,CJ McCollum,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,18.0,7.0,18.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,32,Kemba Walker,2.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,14.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,32,Damian Lillard,7.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,7.0,18.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,35,Frank Kaminsky,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,24,Noah Vonleh,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18,Marco Belinelli,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,23,Allen Crabbe,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,17,Ramon Sessions,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,18,Evan Turner,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,19,Roy Hibbert,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,Meyers Leonard,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,17,Brian Roberts,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Jake Layman,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4

												The New York Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics, 117-106, at TD Garden on Wednesday. 

The Celtics were expected to win this game easily against a shorthanded Knicks team, but they were dominated in this shocking result. The rebounding was the glaring difference, with New York winning that battle, 57-33. The bench production was a major part of that, with the Knicks bench outrebounding the Celtics bench, 35-8. Shooting was also decisive, with the Knicks shooting 51 percent from the field, while the Celtics failed to crack 39 percent shooting. 

The Knicks (19-24) had to play this game without Kristaps Porzingis and Joakim Noah, but prevailed with an impressive road win. Derrick Rose had a vintage performance, tallying 30 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Willy Hernangomez was huge off the bench, providing 17 points and 11 rebounds. Courtney Lee collected nine points, eight rebounds and seven assists off the bench as well. Mindaugas Kuzminskas got the start for Porzingis and accrued 17 points and six rebounds. New York will play again on Thursday against the Washington Wizards.

The Celtics (26-16) had won 13 of 16 games headed into this matchup, but this was simply a game where they didn't have it. Isaiah Thomas kept Boston hanging around, as he dropped a game-high 39 points, while adding three rebounds and two assists. Al Horford did hand out 10 assists and grab seven boards, but he scored just five points on 2-of-14 from the field. Jae Crowder was second on the team, dropping 21 points and five rebounds. Boston will be off until Saturday when they host the Portland Trail Blazers for their next game.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Orlando Magic 118-98 Wednesday at Smoothie King Center. 

It was a complete team effort for the Pelicans (17-26), as they managed to grab a lead in the first quarter and never let go. It wasn't all drama-free however, as Anthony Davis left in the middle of the game with a hand sprain, but he was able to return shortly after. The superstar big man finished with 21 points and 14 in just 29 minutes, which was his seventh double-double in his last eight games. But what really carried New Orleans through the final stretch of the game was their bench, as Langston Galloway and Tyreke Evans each scored 18 points as reserves, with the bench as a whole scoring 54 of the team's 118 points Wednesday. On top of all that, the Pelicans managed to shoot an impressive 41.7 percent from behind the arc.

As for the Magic (17-27), they have now lost three in a row and seven of their last eight games following Wednesday's performance. While four of their five starters managed to score in double figures, no one was able to a put together a standout performance on a forgettable night for the team. Their main issue ended up being their inability to take care of the basketball, as they had just 18 assists to their 18 turnovers. They also ended up shooting a poor 44 percent from the field and shot just 11 free throws throughout the 48 minutes. 

Up next, the Pelicans will remain home Friday when they take on the Nets, while the Magic will look to turn things around Friday against the Bucks.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 111-92 Wednesday at Toyota Center. 

It was a battle between All-Stars, with James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo going head-to-head Wednesday night, with each managing to put on a show. Ultimately, while the Greek Freak made things interesting for a moment, Harden managed to lead an offensive onslaught that helped the Rockets (33-12) pull away in the fourth quarter. Harden finished the game with 38 points, eight assists and and six rebounds in 37 minutes. Meanwhile, Eric Gordon, who was coming off a brutal 3-of-17 shooting performance in Tuesday's loss to the Heat, bounced back in a huge way. The shooting guard finished with 25 points on 9-of-20 shooting from the field, which included hitting seven shots from behind the arc. Beyond those two, however, only two other Houston players managed to score in double figures, with Patrick Beverly and Montrezl Harrell each notching 12 points of their own.

For the Bucks (20-21), Antetokounmpo scored a team-high 32 points on top of 11 rebounds, six assists and three blocks as the team dropped below .500 once again. Unfortunately for the Bucks, Wednesday ended up being a one-man show, with the rest of the Bucks' starters struggling mightily to get the ball in the hoop. While Antetokounmpo went an impressive 13-of-20 from the field, the other four starters went just 13-of-36 (36 percent). Overall as a team, Milwaukee managed to shoot just 40 percent from the field and a poor 25 percent from long range in the losing effort.

												The host Detroit Pistons blew out the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, 118-95.

Detroit (20-24) overcame inconsistent play and a sub-par bench performance for a blowout win against Atlanta.  While finding production from their bench has been an issue for the Pistons throughout the season, the starting five was able to more than make up for it on Wednesday.  Every starter scored at least 13, and the starting five helped lead a 42-point first quarter that established an almost insurmountable lead for the Pistons.  Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson led the team with 26 points on 50 percent shooting, while All-Star Andre Drummond crashed the glass for 17 rebounds.  Altogether, Detroit showed very little weakness in the crushing win, shooting almost 50 percent and holding a 60-32 advantage in the rebounding column.

The Hawks (24-18) had seen hot play in recent weeks but struggled severely on Tuesday.  The team shot under 39 percent from the floor and was absolutely demolished on the boards.  One area in which the Hawks struggled was three-point shooting, where the team went just 6-of-25 from the field.  Atlanta was also unable to match up with Detroit's powerful starting five, as the Hawks' own starters looked shaky at best.  Two starters combined for just four points and the starting five as a whole committed eight turnovers on the night.

The Pistons will host the Wizards on Saturday while the Hawks will face the Bulls on Friday.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, 121-100.

The Warriors (36-6) have now won five straight and nine of their last ten.  Prior to Wednesday's matchup against his former team, Golden State's Kevin Durant said that it would not be a ""normal game.""  Durant's play indicated a special level of effort, as the former MVP scored 40 points and shot 13-of-16 while pulling down 12 rebounds.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry also impressed, scoring 24 points to go with eight assists and three steals.
The Warriors were able to pull away in the third quarter, going on a scoring tear while Russell Westbrook sat on the bench.  The team shot almost 55 percent and dished out a whopping 35 assists on the night.

The Thunder (25-19) saw strong play from a handful of players but could not get the job done as a team.  In what has almost become a normal night for the superstar, Russell Westbrook posted a massive triple-double.  Westbrook scored 27 points to go with 15 rebounds and 13 assists.  However, the elite point guard did commit 10 turnovers on the night.  Sixth man Enes Kanter delivered 22 points and nine rebounds off the bench.  The team had issues keeping up with the Warriors' star power on defense and had a problem crashing the glass, finishing with a 10 rebound deficit.  

The Warriors will face the Rockets on Friday, while OKC will enjoy the rest of the week off.

												The Indiana Pacers used a big second-half comeback to defeat the host Sacramento Kings, 106-100, on Wednesday at Golden 1 Center.

The Pacers (22-19), who trailed by as many as 22 in the first half, were down 60-41 at halftime before rallying behind Paul George and Jeff Teague to outscore the Kings, 65-40, in the second half. George finished with 24 points on 8-of-15 shooting while Teague totaled 22 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds. Teague, who was 11 of 11 from the free-throw line, hit two foul shots with 1:55  to play to give Indiana a 99-98 lead that it would not relinquish. 

Rudy Gay tore his left Achilles' tendon on a drive to the basket with 20 seconds left in the third quarter. He went down without contact and was carried off the floor. From that point, the Pacers outscored the Kings, 37-21. 

DeMarcus Cousins posted his fifth career triple-double, finishing with 25 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, but it wasn't enough to keep the Kings (16-25) from losing for the eighth time in their last 10 games, including a 1-6 mark at home in that span. 

The Pacers travel to Los Angeles to face the Lakers on Friday while the Kings start a season-high eight-game road trip in Memphis.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 119-109, at Barclays Center on Tuesday.

The Raptors (28-13) opted to give Kyle Lowry the night off to rest assorted bumps and bruises that he'd recently endured, thrusting the capable Cory Joseph into the starting five. The talented point guard responded in fine fashion, checking second on the Raptors with 33 points, which he supplemented with four assists and four rebounds. Joseph shot an outstanding 15-of-22 from the field, more than making up for the absence of the All-Star-caliber player he replaced. His contributions, combined with those of DeMar DeRozan, spearheaded an offensive effort that saw Toronto tally a 52.2 percent success rate from the field, and an even more impressive 52.6 percent mark from three-point range.

The Raptors were actually led by DeRozan, who went for 36 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and a steal. With Tuesday's production, he becomes the only other player besides Vince Carter in franchise history to register a total of 20 games with 30 more more points in a season. The only other two double-digit scoring efforts came from the bench in form of Terrence Ross, who led the second unit with 15 points and added four rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal, and Fred VanVleet, who posted 10 points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals. DeMarre Carroll generated nine points, three boards, an assist and a pair of steals. Jonas Valanciunas produced a modest seven points but hauled in 10 rebounds. 

Brook Lopez's 28 points led the Nets (8-33), and he complemented the total with eight boards, two assists and two blocks. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was next with 14 points, eight boards, three assists, a steal and a block in 26 minutes off the bench. The emerging Caris LeVert followed with 14 points of his own, along with four assists, three rebounds and two steals in a reserve role as well. Bojan Bogdanovic was the only other member of the first unit with double digits in the scoring column, as he supplied 11 points, along with three boards and a steal. Trevor Booker pitched in with eight points, eight rebounds, two assists and a block. Spencer Dinwiddie could only muster five points, while Joe Harris notably went scoreless over 18 minutes. It was more of a successful night for the Nets' second unit, as they combined for 57 points overall.

The Raptors head to Philadelphia to tangle with the Sixers on Wednesday night, while the Nets head to New Orleans to face the Pelicans on Friday  night.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Houston Rockets, 109-103, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday.

This appeared like an easy Houston win on paper, but Miami had other ideas with this impressive performance. A 20-3 run in the fourth quarter was the decisive stretch for the Heat, as that gave Miami their largest lead of the game. It was tight throughout though, as there were 15 ties and 19 lead changes, with no team leading by more than seven points until that huge run at the end. Shooting was the key difference, with Miami hitting 47 percent of their shots, while Houston were held to just 40 percent. The Heat also did work in the paint, winning that battle, 64-50.

The Rockets (32-12) are in a bit of a rut right now, as this marks their third loss in their last four games. James Harden picked up yet another triple-double though, accumulating 40 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Patrick Beverley was second among starters, totaling 12 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Trevor Ariza amassed 11 points and eight rebounds. Eric Gordon really hurt the Rockets off the bench, providing just seven points, one rebound and one assist on 3-of-17 shooting.

The Heat (12-30) have been unlucky in terms of results this season and a win over the Rockets shows just how good they can be. Goran Dragic led the team in scoring, accruing 21 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Hassan Whiteside recorded another double-double, dropping 14 points and 15 rebounds. Dion Waiters was the only other starter in double figures, collecting 17 points, five rebounds and three assists. James Johnson was huge off the bench, providing 15 points, eight rebounds, six assists and three steals. Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington were also great off the bench, combining for 34 points and six rebounds.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Chicago Bulls 99-98 Tuesday at American Airlines Center.

The Mavericks (14-27) held a comfortable seven-point lead heading into halftime before allowing superstar Jimmy Butler and the Bulls to come storming back and make it a competitive ball game. In the final minute of the game, Jimmy Butler's mid-range jumper broke a 96-96 tie and put Chicago up two, but then, a 25-foot Wesley Matthews 3-pointer gave Dallas back the lead. One last stop for the Mavericks gave them their third straight victory, as they are starting to hit their stride midway through January. The team was led by Harrison Barnes, who scored a team-high 20 points in the contest, but it was a total team effort Tuesday night, with six different Mavericks scoring in double figures. 

As for the Bulls (21-22), the loss puts them back under .500 after they had won two straight, and it also drops them to 0-2 against Dallas this season. Butler was once again impressive with a great all-around performance, posting 24 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds in 40 minutes. But the surprise performance came from Robin Lopez, who has remained rather quiet production-wise in his stint with the Bulls. Lopez finished Tuesday's contest with 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting from the field and five rebounds. It was by far the best performance of the season from the big man, the efforts of Butler and Lopez just weren't enough in the end. 

Up next, the Mavericks will look to keep things rolling in Miami on Thursday, while the Bulls will head to Atlanta on Friday to take on the Hawks.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 122-114 at AT&T Center on Tuesday. 

The game remained close through three quarters, with the Spurs (32-9) and Timberwolves (14-28) exchanging blows throughout the contest. San Antonio, however, was ultimately able to pull away in the final period, opening up a lead that got as high as 14 points with just over a minute and a half remaining. And they managed to do so with a pair of unbelievable performances from their two stars in the frontcourt. Kawhi Leonard finished with a game-high 34 points, seven rebounds and five assists in 39 minutes, while LaMarcus Aldridge added 29 points, four rebounds and three assists of his own. Together, the two shot 24-of-37 from the field. 

For the Timberwolves, the loss ends what was an impressive three-game win streak, as they missed an opportunity Tuesday to notch their third straight victory over a team with a winning record. Nevertheless, they still got yet another tremendous performance from Karl-Anthony Towns, who continues to have a very productive January. Towns finished with 27 points and 16 rebounds with the help of his point guard Ricky Rubio, who posted 21 points and 14 assists while going an impressive 13-of-14 from the free throw line. Ultimately, it was Minnesota's lack of depth that led to the team running out of gas in the closing moments, with just three reserves seeing time on the court and combining for 21 points.

Up next, the Spurs will take on the Nuggets at home on Thursday, while the Timberwolves will look to get back to their winning ways in Los Angeles on Friday against the Clippers.

												The Denver Nuggets took down the host Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 127-121.

The Nuggets (17-23) have now won three straight games.  One of the key components of Denver's win streak has been the play of sophomore big man Nikola Jokic.  Jokic came off a career-high 30 points against the Magic for 29 on Tuesday, also recording 15 rebounds and three blocks.  Seven of Jokic's rebounds came on the offensive end, as the young center made a major impact for the Nuggets' offense.  Although starting shooting guard Gary Harris (ankle) missed the tilt in Los Angeles, Denver seemingly had no trouble making up for his missing offensive output.  Versatile wing Will Barton slid into the starting lineup in Harris's place and contributed 26 points to go with eight assists.  Barton was just one piece of a well-oiled Denver offense, as the team dished out 29 assists and shot over 56 percent on the night.  

The Lakers (15-31) very nearly came back from a double-digit deficit in the fourth quarter.  Despite trailing by just two with under a minute to play, Los Angeles was unable to come away with a much-needed home win.  One of Los Angeles's main issues on Tuesday was one that has plagued the team throughout the season - disappointing play from the starting five.  Four Lakers came off the bench for double digit points, including 24 for former Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams and 19 for guard Jordan Clarkson, who was listed as questionable with an ankle injury prior to the game.  Nevertheless, struggles from the starters ended up burying the Lakers.  Big man Julius Randle shot just 2-of-8 for seven points and had five turnovers, while point guard D'Angelo Russell had only five points and three assists.  

The Nuggets will play in San Antonio on Thursday, while the Lakers will host the Pacers on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the New York Knicks, 108-107, at Madison Square Garden on Monday afternoon.

Both teams came into the game with notable changes to their respective starting lineups. Atlanta (24-17) gave Dwight Howard the afternoon off for rest, which slid Paul Millsap over to center and Thabo Sefolosha to power forward, as Mike Muscala was unavailable due to an ankle injury suffered Sunday. Meanwhile, the Knicks (18-24) replaced Courtney Lee with Ron Baker at the two-guard spot, and brought Mindaugas Kuzminskas into the starting five as well with Lance Thomas unavailable due to a broken orbital bone and possible concussion brought about by a Jonas Valanciunas elbow a day prior. Carmelo Anthony shifted to power forward in place of Kristaps Porzingis, who was once again absent due to his sore Achilles. The personnel shifts didn't affect the quality of play in the least, and in fact, may have enhanced it. The two teams engaged in an entertaining back-and-forth battle that wasn't decided until the final seconds, when a Joakim Noah shot attempt failed to find the net. Dennis Schroder, who had endured a rough couple of games coming in to Monday, had given the Hawks what would be their final margin of victory with a 25-foot three-pointer jumper with 22 seconds remaining.

A revitalized Schroder led Atlanta with 28 points overall, a total he supplemented with three rebounds and three assists. Tim Hardaway, Jr. checked in second with 20 points, four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Millsap was effective at the five, posting 17 points, seven rebounds, six assists, three steals and three blocks. Kent Bazemore followed up a strong Sunday showing with 16 points, six rebounds, five assists and a steal. Kris Humphries got extra run off the bench with Muscala out and led the second unit with 14 points, seven boards, an assist and a steal.

The Knicks were paced by Carmelo Anthony, who went off for 30 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal. Derrick Rose followed with a near double-double consisting of 18 points, nine assists, four rebounds, a steal and a block. Kuzminskas supplied 14 points, five rebounds, two assists and a pair of steals. Noah registered a modest seven points but hauled in 17 boards, while also providing three assists, two blocks and a steal. Justin Holiday led the bench with 11 points and four rebounds.

The Hawks continue on the road and next head to the Motor City, where they'll face the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. The Knicks make the short trip to Boston to tangle with the Celtics that same evening.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 120-101, at Verizon Center on Monday.

The Wizards have been one of the best teams in the league over recent weeks and they gave it to the Blazers in this dominating win. In fact, Washington pulled out a wire-to-wire victory, as they took a 37-21 lead after the first quarter, with the game never getting within 10 points after that. Three-point shooting was the difference, with the Wizards going 13-of-23, while the Blazers hit just 8-of-26 from long range. Washington dominated many of the statistics, winning the shooting, rebounding, assisting and turnover differentials. 

The Trail Blazers (18-25) have struggled on defense all season and a 75-point first half allowed to the Wizards only adds to those troubles. Damian Lillard was the lone bright spot for Portland, as he tallied 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists. C.J. McCollum and Al-Farouq Aminu were second among starters, scoring 12 points a piece. Evan Turner led the bench in scoring, dropping 14 points to go along with his three rebounds. The Trail Blazers will look to play better on Wednesday in a road matchup with the Charlotte Hornets.

The Wizards (21-19) have been dominant at home this season, as this marks their 17th win at Verizon Center. Bradley Beal scored a game-high 25 points, adding five assists and three steals on 7-of-11 shooting. John Wall wasn't far behind, as he accumulated 24 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Markieff Morris recorded a double-double, totaling 17 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. Kelly Oubre Jr. was a nice spark off the bench, accruing 18 points, four rebounds and two assists. Tomas Satoransky recorded a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double off the bench as well. Washington will host the Memphis Grizzlies for their next game on Wednesday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 113-104, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Monday,

In a battle between two young and talented teams, Philadelphia were able to prevail with a huge road victory. The key run for the Sixers was a 16-3 spurt in the middle of the fourth quarter that put distance between them and the Bucks. There were 12 ties and 11 lead changes in total, as this game was close throughout. Rebounding was the biggest factor for the Sixers, as they won that battle, 51-38. Free-throw shooting really killed the Bucks too, as they went 15-of-22, while the Sixers went 29-of-36 from the charity stripe.

The Sixers (13-26) have been a different team with Joel Embiid in the fold and he was a huge factor yet again here. Embiid tallied 22 points, 12 rebounds, two steals and five blocks, with 18 of those points coming in the second half. Sergio Rodriguez got the start for T.J. McConnell (wrist), as he accrued 10 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Dario Saric was huge off the bench, providing 17 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Chasson Randle, Jahlil Okafor, Robert Covington and Gerald Henderson all scored between 10 and 11 points as well. On deck for Philly is a home matchup against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday.

The Bucks (20-20) finally got above .500, but a loss to the Sixers shows the natural growing pains for a young team like this. Giannis Antetokounmpo was Milwaukee's best player, accumulating 23 points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks. With that said, he scored just two points in the second half, going 1-of-8 from the field before fouling out with three minutes left. Jabari Parker finished with 23 points, five rebounds and two steals. Greg Monroe was the lone Milwaukee bench player in double figures, totaling 14 points and six rebounds. Milwaukee will travel for their next game, when they play the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 98-95, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday afternoon.

The Pacers (21-19) came in to Monday's tilt hot, having emerged victorious in five of their previous six games, and appeared to be well on their way to easily extending that streak after the first 12 minutes. Indiana outscored the Pelicans (16-26) by a 32-18 margin in the first quarter, but New Orleans battled back to pull within 54-52 by halftime. Despite losing Anthony Davis for the duration of the game to hip and thumb injuries after a hard fall in the third quarter, the visitors hung tough, but ultimately couldn't capitalize on a series of missed free throws by the Pacers down the stretch. Ultimately, a Tyreke Evans' missed three-point jumper at the buzzer sealed the hard-fought home victory for Indiana, their 17th at Bankers Life Fieldhouse this season.

Despite his early exit, Davis led the way for the Pelicans with 16 points, three rebounds and three assists. Terrance Jones, who saw additional run with Davis sidelined, went for 15 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks in 26 minutes off the bench. E'Twaun Moore equaled his scoring total and added three rebounds, two blocks and a steal. Evans provided 12 points, five rebounds, four assists and a pair of steals. Jrue Holiday couldn't step up in Davis' absence, going for a modest 11 points, six assists, two rebounds and a steal, while also committing a team-high five turnovers. Buddy Hield registered 10 points, four rebounds and a block in 15 minutes.

The Pacers were led by Paul George's 19 points, which he complemented with six assists, five rebounds and two steals. Myles Turner pitched in with an 18-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included an assist and four blocks. Thaddeus Young was excellent down low, posting 17 points, three rebounds, two assists and a game-high six steals. Jeff Teague was right behind him with a 16-point, 10-assist double-double that also featured eight rebounds, although the veteran point guard did turn the ball over a game-high seven times. Al Jefferson led the second unit with 10 points.

The Pelicans head back home to face off with the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night, while the Pacers visit Sacramento that same evening.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Orlando Magic 125-112 Tuesday at Pepsi Center. 

It was a wire-to-wire victory for the Nuggets (17-23), who have now won two in a row after a five-game losing streak. They were led by a monster performance from big man Nikola Jokic, who posted a game-high 30 points on 13-of-19 shooting, 11 rebounds, five assists and three steals in 36 minutes. The performance was Jokic's first 30-point game of the regular season and his third double-double in as many games. Emanuel Mudiay added a double-double of his own, recording 18 points and a game-high 13 assists in 37 minutes, while Kenneth Faried played a wildly efficient game offensively as the team's starting power forward, posting 20 points on 10-of-12 shooting from the field. Overall as a team, Denver had a field day shooting the ball, as the Nuggets finished Monday's game shooting 58.4 percent from the field. 

As for the Magic (17-26), they have now lost two games in a row and six of their last seven. They were once again led by point guard Elfrid Payton, who has now put together a great three-game stretch. After posting 20 points, 12 rebounds and four assists in Monday's contest, he is now averaging 22.3 points, 9.3 assists and 5.7 rebounds over his last three contests. Overall for Orlando, the problem wasn't offense. They shot 50 percent from the field en route to posting their third straight total over 100 points and had seven different players score in double figures. Again, it was their lackluster defensive effort that made things too easy for the Nuggets offensively Monday. 

Up next, the Nuggets will look for their third straight win against the Lakers on Tuesday, while the Magic will look to turn things around in New Orleans on Wednesday.

												The host Boston Celtics took down the Charlotte Hornets at TD Garden on Monday, 108-98.

Boston (26-15) is now 13-3 in its last 16 contests and has seen star point guard Isaiah Thomas ascend to a new level through his recent play.  Thomas leads the NBA in scoring in the fourth quarter and posted another big final 12 minutes on Monday, scoring 17 points in the fourth to give him 35 on the night.  The All-Star drained seven three-pointers and had five rebounds and four assists in what was yet another astounding night for the Celtics' star.  While the game was close throughout, Boston held the lead from the second quarter and on, never allowing Charlotte to regain control of the game.  A big part of the Celtics' success was All-Star center Al Horford, who quietly scored 22 points while pulling in six rebounds.  Off the bench, center Kelly Olynyk came through for 15 points and nine rebounds after an extremely strong 26-point outing in Atlanta on Friday.  The Celtics also saw the return of injured shooting guard Avery Bradley, who had missed the previous week of play with an achilles injury.  Bradley appeared rusty, however, going for just five points on 2-of-9 shooting and committing a pair of costly turnovers.  

Charlotte (20-21) fell to 0-5 on its road trip with Monday's loss.  The team has struggled mightily after a strong 6-1 start to the season.  Monday, however, showed some promise, as the Hornets were able to hold close to the surging Celtics.  Star point guard Kemba Walker led the team with 24 points while adding four rebounds.  Shooting guard Nicolas Batum was a key factor in almost every element, playing tough defense and narrowly missing a triple-double.  Batum finished with eight points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.

												The host Golden State Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 126-91, in an NBA Finals rematch on Monday.  

Golden State (35-6) avenged its loss on Christmas day with a crushing victory over the Cavaliers on Monday.  The Warriors came out strong from the start, establishing a double-digit lead in the first quarter and a 20-point lead by midway through the second.  Everything seemed to be firing for Golden State on both sides of the ball, as the Warriors shot a ridiculous 50 percent from the floor while draining 15 three-pointers.  Despite historic matchup troubles with Cleveland, reigning MVP Steph Curry delivered on Monday, scoring 20 points to go with 11 assists and four steals.  Curry had recorded a double-double by the end of the Warriors' electrifying first half, playing a major part of the 29-point lead the team was able to establish.   Overall, Golden State absolutely demolished Cleveland in every aspect, including holding a 58-35 rebounding advantage.

Cleveland (29-11) had won four straight against the Warriors prior to Monday's game.  The Cavaliers played arguably their worst game of the season, shooting just 35 percent from the field  and recording only 11 assists.  While pregame statements from team leader LeBron James indicated that Cleveland had undergone no special preparation for Monday's game, the drubbing still came as a surprise to most.  James led the team with 20 points but shot just 6-of-18 and committed an uncharacteristic six turnovers.  Kyrie Irving was just 6-of-19, while Kevin Love was held to only three points.

The Warriors will host the Thunder on Wednesday, while Cleveland will host the Suns on Thursday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Phoenix Suns 106-101 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Monday. 

The neck-and-neck tilt needed all four quarters up until the last few possessions to decide a winner, one in which the Suns (13-28) were able to hang around given Eric Bledsoe's 31 points, which was good to lead all scorers. Phoenix took a six point lead into the second half, but the Jazz (27-16) found more life behind Joe Ingles and Joe Johnson midway through the third quarter, where each player had their hand in rebounding and midrange jumpers that eventually pulled the game within one point with just over :30 remaining in the quarter. George Hill assisted Rudy Gobert on a dunk that tied the game 88-88 with 7:24 left in the fourth quarter, and the back-and-forth continued throughout the remaining minutes. Gordon Hayward and Joe Johnson closed the game out from the free throw line after Bledsoe and T.J. Warren made some clutch baskets down the stretch. 

Bledsoe finished with 31 points, which led all scorers in the loss, to go along with nine points and nine assists, while Devin Booker cooled off from his back-to-back 39 point performances, and went for 25 points in the effort. The Jazz spread the ball in the win, and their top ranked defense was seen most effective behind the arc where they held the Suns to 22.7 percent shooting. All five starters finished in double figures scoring, led by Gobert's 18 points and 17 rebounds. 

Next up, the Suns visit the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, while the Jazz visit the Dallas Mavericks on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 120-98 at Staples Center on Monday. 

The Clippers (29-14) rolled past the Thunder (25-18) at home en route to a seventh straight victory. The absence of Steven Adams in the paint proved to be vital for Oklahoma City as they relied to heavily on the leadership of Russell Westbrook. Adams, who is dealing with a concussion, was sidelined for the tilt. DeAndre Jordan was able to wreak havoc in the paint without Adams there to protect the rim and he went for a big double-double to the tune of 19 points and 15 rebounds. The Clippers took an early lead into the second quarter and were able to continue to pour on the points making the game a healthy blowout by the end of the third quarter. 

Marreese Speights pitched in one of his best performances of the season in leading the bench. Speights finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and three assists on 8-of-15 shooting. Chris Paul left the game with a sprained thumb after registering 14 minutes of action, but he was not needed to continue the blowout down the stretch. Raymond Felton, who has been tasked with starting point guard minutes throughout parts of the season, finished with 15 points and six assists in 27 minutes. 

Russell Westbrook fell far short of his triple-double average after going for 24 points, five rebounds and four assists. The Thunder opted to play small ball and not start a center, however, Enes Kanter played 23 minutes at the center position off the bench and scored 12 points. 

Next up, the Clippers host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday, while the Thunder visit the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 98-87, at American Airlines Center on Sunday. 

The Timberwolves (14-27) had handled the Mavericks last Monday night at the Target Center on the strength of a 34-point, 11-rebound double-double from Karl-Anthony Towns. However, the Mavericks (13-27) appeared intent on not allowing that to transpire again, and their focus on limiting Minnesota's best all-around player was effective enough to insure themselves a home victory. Dallas limited Towns to a solid but tolerable stat line of 18 points, nine rebounds, three assists, steal and block over 38 minutes, while also turning in a balanced offensive effort on their end. The Mavs shot 46.8 percent from the field and 41.4 percent from three-point range, while seeing six players hit double digits in the scoring column.

The T-Wolves were actually paced by Gorgui Dieng, who managed 21 points, eight boards and a steal. Andrew Wiggins posted a full stat line of 19 points, eight rebounds, four assists and a steal. Zach LaVine returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous two games with a hip injury and registered 11 points, five boards, an assist and a steal. Ricky Rubio tallied a modest eight points but did dish out 10 assists, while Nemanja Bjelica went for 10 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal in 22 minutes off the bench.

Dallas was led by Wesley Matthews, who tallied 19 points, along with seven rebounds, an assist and a block. Dirk Nowitzki continued his recent resurgence with 17 points, six rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Deron Williams supplied a 13-point, 10-assist double-double that also included four rebounds and two steals. Harrison Barnes matched Williams' scoring total and added three boards, a block and steal. J.J. Barea led the second unit with 15 points, three rebounds and three assists, while Devin Harris posted 10 points, three rebounds and three assists.

The Timberwolves remain in the Lone Star State to do battle with the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday evening, while the Mavericks head to the Windy City for a showdown with the Chicago Bulls on that same night.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the New York Knicks, 116-101, at Air Canada Centre on Sunday.

The Knicks (18-23) found themselves without star power forward Kristaps Porzingis for a second consecutive game due to his sore Achilles, and his absence seemed to make a considerable difference, particularly in the middle portion of the game. After hanging tough with the Raptors (27-13) through the first period, New York saw their hosts outscore them by a whopping 69-38 margin over the second and third quarters. Toronto was particularly dominant coming out of the halftime locker room, as they blasted their visitors by a 27-8 spread in the third quarter. The Raptors were able to shoot an impressive 49.4 percent from the field overall, while seeing three players eclipse the 20-point mark.

The Knicks were led by Carmelo Anthony's 18 points, although he was only able to add a rebound and an assist to his stat line. Justin Holiday was the second-leading scorer for the Knicks and accomplished the distinction from the bench, as he totaled 17 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal over 26 minutes. Derrick Rose was next with 16 points, three assists, two rebounds and a block. Joakim Noah notably contributed just one point but did haul in eight boards. Lance Thomas had to exit the contest after just two minutes as a result of an elbow to the face. Mindaugas Kuzminskas provided nine points, two rebounds and an assist in 23 minutes off the bench in his stead.

DeMar DeRozan paced the Raptors with 23 points, five rebounds and five assists. Norman Powell was right behind him with an impressive performance off the bench, posting 21 points, a rebound and a steal over 24 minutes. DeMarre Carroll went for 20 points, two boards, two steals and a block. Jonas Valanciunas chipped in with a 12-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included an assist. Terrence Ross got in the act as well, generating 12 points, two rebounds and an assist in 23 minutes.

The Knicks head back home to face off with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday afternoon, while the Raptors head to New York to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday evening.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 111-98, at Phillips Arena on Sunday. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo has undoubtedly been the linchpin of the Bucks' (20-19) attack all season, but over-reliance on any one player, even one as talented as the Greek Freak, can leave a team vulnerable. That was the case on Sunday, as the Hawks (23-17) were able to counter a 33-point, eight-rebound, six-assist effort from Milwaukee's star with five double-digit scoring efforts, four of which came from the starting five. Atlanta was also on fire from the floor, as they posted respective 52.5 and 50.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range. Their pinpoint accuracy helped them overcome a whopping 19 turnovers, as did the 16 they elicited from the visitors.

Antetokounmpo added three blocks and two steals to his aforementioned stat line. Greg Monroe led the bench with 13 points, a rebound and an assist. Malcolm Brogdon was next with 12 points, two steals and a block. Jabari Parker was only able to muster eight points but did haul in 10 rebounds and dish out nine assists. He also added a steal. Michael Beasley was productive in a reserve role as well with 11 points. 

The Hawks were led by Kent Bazemore, who produced his second-best scoring total of the season with 24 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. The recently-acquired Mike Dunleavy chipped in off the bench with 20 points, three rebounds and two assists. Paul Millsap generated a full stat line of 18 points, eight rebounds, five assists and a pair of blocks. Dwight Howard supplied a 16-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included two assists, a steal and a block. Thabo Sefolosha turned in 10 points, three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Malcolm Delaney continued his recent surge with nine points, nine assists, a rebound and a steal in 26 minutes off the bench.

The Bucks head back home to face off with the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday afternoon, while the Hawks tangle with the Knicks in New York on Monday afternoon as well.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 137-112, at Barclay's Center on Sunday.

The second-best offense facing the worst defense usually results in a lot of points and that was just the case here. This was a near wire-to-wire win for Houston, as they won each individual quarter and never trailed after the first three minutes. Scoring came at ease for the Rockets, as they shot 51 percent from the field and 48 percent from three-point range. Rebounding was a key advantage for Houston, winning that battle, 50-38. The Houston starters really put it to the Nets starters too, outscoring them, 89-49.

The Rockets (32-11) were in the midst of their first losing streak of the season, but a matchup against the Nets is a great way to break that. James Harden was once again the star, as he tallied 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists en route to a triple-double. Eric Gordon was a huge spark off the bench, as he accrued 24 points, three rebounds and three assists. Trevor Ariza also surpassed 20 points, providing 23 points, eight rebounds and two steals. Patrick Beverley collected 16 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Montrezl Harrell got the start at center and dropped 16 points and seven rebounds.

The Nets (8-32) have struggled on defense all season and a date with the Rockets is the last thing they wanted to see. Trevor Booker led the team in scoring, contributing 18 points, five rebounds and three steals. Justin Hamilton got the start for Brook Lopez (rest) and totaled 11 points, three rebounds and three blocks in the defeat. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was great off the bench, amassing 14 points, seven rebounds and three steals.

Both teams will be in action again on Tuesday, as they Rockets play the Miami Heat on the road, while the Nets host the Toronto Raptors.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Sacramento Kings 122-118 at Golden 1 Center on Sunday. 

A tale of two halves, as the Kings (16-24) made a resurgent effort in the second half, unfortunately for the home team, Russell Westbrook got hot at the same time. Westbrook recorded his 20th triple-double of the season for the Thunder (25-17), and still maintains a triple-double average as we near the all-star break. Victor Oladipo and Enes Kanter were effective in the first half, and were able to take a 13 point lead into halftime. Sacramento was able to mount a comeback by slowly picking away at the Thunder and keeping pace with their scoring until late in the fourth quarter. Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins did most of the leg work for the Kings down the stretch, although they fell four points short of sending the game to overtime. 

Westbrook went on to finish with 36 points, 10 assists, 11 rebounds, four steals and seven turnovers on 11-of-21 shooting. Oladipo added 23 points and did most of his damage by going a perfect 8-of-8 from the free throw line, while Kanter contributed 29 points across 32 minutes off the bench. Cousins filled a remarkable box score line that was only overshadowed by Westbrook. The Kings all-star center finished with 31 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and one block across 34 minutes. Cousins went to the line over and over, and ended up going 14-of-17 from the charity stripe. Rudy Gay added 22 points, while Darren Collison pitched in 21 points. 

The Thunder play the second game of a back-to-back on Monday when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers, while the Kings look to bounce back on Wednesday when they host the Indiana Pacers.

												The visiting Chicago Bulls took down the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday, 108-104. 

Chicago (21-21) did not let the second half of a back-to-back hold them down on Sunday, as the team fought out the game until the final seconds.  Despite a slow start to the game, the Bulls came out with a whopping 38 points in the second quarter and held double-digit leads at points.  Scoring came from an unusual place on Sunday, as forward Doug McDermott led the team with 31 off the bench.  McDermott hit three three-pointers and went 10-of-11 from the free-throw line.  For the starting unit, superstar wing Jimmy Butler provided offense with 16 points and six assists while also pulling down eight rebounds and coming away with three steals.  

Memphis (25-18) entered Sunday having won three of its last four games but stumbled down the stretch against the talented Bulls.  The team saw strong play from its core of veterans again on Sunday, as Marc Gasol and Mike Conley led the starting unit.  Gasol had a 24-point, 11-rebound double-double, while Conley scored a team-high 28.  Veteran Zach Randolph helped the Grizzlies stay in the mix with a whopping eight offensive rebounds off the bench.  However, the team was held back by foul trouble, as they sent the Bulls to the free-throw line 35 times on the night.  Six Grizzlies finished the night with at least three fouls.

												The visiting Detroit Pistons took down the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, 102-97.  

Detroit (19-24) needed the win on Sunday after having lost three straight, including two consecutive blowouts.  In Los Angeles, the Pistons looked as though they were in better form, as the team shot a respectable 43 percent with 24 assists.  All-Star center Andre Drummond led the team with a whopping 17 rebounds and posted 15 points.  Two starters, Marcus Morris and Tobias Harris, scored 23 points.  The Pistons' bench, however, remains one of the weakest in the NBA.  The Detroit second unit combined for only 21 points and committed eight fouls.

The Lakers (15-30) are now the owners of a four-game losing streak.  Los Angeles had the opposite problem of Detroit, as many of the team's starters struggled from the field.  Only D'Angelo Russell scored in double figures for the Lakers' starting five, and both Julius Randle and Luol Deng went 1-of-6 for two points.  Off the bench, however, Lou Williams led the team with 26 points while Jordan Clarkson contributed 16.  The team also struggled from deep, though, shooting just 6-of-26 on three-pointers.  

The Lakers will host the Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Pistons will host the Hawks the Wednesday.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 113-97, at Staples Center on Saturday.

These two Los Angeles teams have switched roles over recent years and the Clippers showed just who the better team is once again here. It was a wire-to-wire win for the Clippers, as they took an 11-point lead after the first quarter and never allowed the Lakers to get within eight points after that. The Clippers were lights-out from the field, as they shot 52 percent in their win. Turnovers really killed the Lakers, as they lost that differential, 14-7. The Clippers also abused the Lakers in the paint, winning that battle, 56-36. The Lakers starters really let them down here, being outscored, 77-41 by the Clippers starters.

The Lakers (15-29) have now lost seven-straight games on the road, as they continue to slide down the standings. Jordan Clarkson was the team's best player, as he collected 21 points, four rebounds and three assists off the bench. Brandon Ingram was second in scoring, providing 14 points, five rebounds and five assists off the bench as well. D'Angelo Russell and Julius Randle combined for just nine points on 3-of-14 shooting, playing 27 minutes apiece. The Lakers will be in action again on Sunday against the Detroit Pistons. 

The Clippers (28-14) have been a different team since Chris Paul returned from injury, as this marks their sixth-straight win. DeAndre Jordan was the player of the game, as he totaled 24 points and 22 rebounds on 12-of-13 from the field. Paul was equally as good, accumulating 20 points, five rebounds and 13 assists. Raymond Felton was a huge spark off the bench, providing 15 points and four assists. The Clippers will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday for their next game.

												The Chicago Bulls hung on to defeat the visiting New Orleans Pelicans, 107-99, at United Center on Saturday evening. 

Jimmy Butler scored 18 points in the first half, to lead the Bulls to a 55-45 lead at halftime. They extended their lead to as many as 15 points in the third quarter but the Pelicans were able to battle back to make it a one-point game with 10:53 left in the fourth quarter. However, Dwyane Wade exploded for 17 points in the fourth quarter, where he went 7-of-10 from the field to lead Chicago to the win. 

The Bulls (20-21) took a staggering 101 shots from the field, hitting 42.6 percent, including 8-of-20 from long range. They missed 10 of their 23 free throws, but were able to hang on for a much-needed win. Jimmy Butler was the high-point man for Chicago, with 28 points on 9-of-16 shooting, to go along with eight rebounds, six assists, four steals and two blocks, in 39 minutes. Dwyane Wade finished the game 9-of-24 from the field but came up big when it counted, finishing with 22 points, to go along with five rebounds, five assists and two steals, in 32 minutes. Taj Gibson complimented his guards with a solid night of his own, as he tallied 15 points, 16 rebounds and two blocks, in 32 minutes. The Bulls are now 13-8 at home but will have to switch gears, as their next game takes place in Memphis on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, Anthony Davis did all he could to save his Pelicans (16-25), as he poured in a game-high 36 points, to go along with 14 rebounds, three blocks, two assists and one steal, in 39 minutes. The only other starter to score in double digits for New Orleans was Solomon Hill who finished with 10, while E'Twaun Moore added 16 points and Tyreke Evans chipped in 14 points off the bench. Despite having one of the league's top rebounders and inside players, the Pelicans were out-rebounded by 21 and out-scored in the paint. They fall to 6-14 on the road and are now one more game away from the eighth spot in the West. The Pelicans will wrap up a five-game road trip as they take on the Pacers in Indiana on Monday.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 108-105, in the Suns' second straight game at Mexico City Arena, on Saturday evening. 

The Suns gave the Spurs trouble right from the start, matching the top-tier squad in the first quarter, but fell back to trail by seven by halftime. However, the Suns came out of the locker room to win both the third and fourth quarters, out-scoring the Spurs 57-47 in the second half. 

Devin Booker seems to really like playing in Mexico City, as he followed his 39-point performance on Thursday, with another 39 points on Saturday, to lead his squad past the Spurs. The Suns (13-27) shot 45.9 percent from the field in the contest, while Booker helped boost those numbers, as he went 12-of-22 from the field. The only other players to score in double digits for the Suns were Eric Bledsoe, who finished with 17 points, to go along with 10 assists and six rebounds, and T.J. Warren who finished with 12 points. Phoenix won the battle on the glass by 12 and was plus-seven in fast break points, as it's youthful hustle came in handy. The Suns are now 3-2 in their last five games but still remain right at the bottom of the West. However, they're still only about five games removed from eighth place. 

Kawhi Leonard led the way for the Spurs (31-9) with 38 points on 12-of-20 shooting, in 32 minutes. The next highest scorer was Manu Ginobili, who finished with 16 points, in 25 minutes off the bench. Tony Parker added 14 points, while the only other player to score in double digits for the Spurs was LaMarcus Aldridge, who finished with 13 points on 6-of-14 shooting, to go along with four rebounds and two assists, in 34 minutes. The Spurs struggled early, to the point where Gregg Popovic pulled all five of his starters early in the first quarter, but the subs who came in did a good job of getting San Antonio back in the game. However, the sluggishness seemed to stick with them in the long run, as they were out-played by the youthful Suns.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 109-93, at Verizon Center on Saturday. 

The Wizards were expected to win this game rather easily and they took care of business after the first quarter. Philadelphia actually led, 30-21 after the first quarter, but it was all Washington from there. In fact, they outscored the Sixers by nine in the second quarter and 15 in the third quarter to eventually pull away. Defense was key for the Wizards, as they held the Sixers to 41 percent from the field, 52 percent from the free-throw line and 32 percent from three-point range. Washington were very efficient on their end, as they shot 48 percent from the field and 47 percent from three-point range. 

The Sixers (12-26) had to play this game without Joel Embiid, as they clearly couldn't make up for his absence. Jahlil Okafor got the start for Embiid and led the team with 26 points and nine rebounds. Ersan Ilyasova wasn't far behind, totaling 18 points and seven rebounds. The other three starters really struggled, as Nik Stauskas, Robert Convington and T.J. McConnell combined for 13 points on 5-of-23 shooting. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot was a nice spark off the bench, collecting 12 points, six rebounds and two assists.

The Wizards (20-19) were in a must win against a shorthanded Sixers team and they didn't disappoint with an easy victory. John Wall was the player of the game, as he accumulated 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Bradley Beal was second on the team, as he dropped 20 points to go along with four rebounds. Markieff Morris and Marcin Gortat did a great job down low, combining for 26 points and 19 rebounds. All five starters scored in double figures, despite none of them playing the final eight minutes.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Orlando Magic, 114-107, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday. 

The Jazz (26-16) have a well-earned defensive reputation, but they did a fine job lighting up the scoreboard on Saturday as well after falling behind early. All five members of their first unit tallied double digits in the scoring column, and Utah shot a stellar 49.4 percent from the field overall. The Magic (17-25) did a pretty good job of keeping pace, though, as they emerged from the first quarter with a 42-29 lead and managed a 46.3 percent success rate from the floor. However, Utah's vaunted defense asserted its dominance following their disastrous first 12 minutes, limiting Orlando to just 65 points over the last three quarters. 

Elfrid Payton led all scorers with 28 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block. Aaron Gordon went for 21 points, four boards, two assists and a steal. Nikola Vucevic couldn't quite duplicate his standout effort from Friday night versus the Suns, but did contribute a solid 15 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals. Serge Ibaka overcame a questionable designation due to a shoulder injury to take the floor and tally 13 points, five rebounds and two assists. Jodie Meeks notched a spot start in place of Evan Fournier (foot) and collected 12 points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal. Jeff Green led the bench with 11 points and five rebounds. 

Gordon Hayward paced the Jazz with 23 points, seven assists, five rebounds and a steal. Rudy Gobert was next with a monster 19-point, 19-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two blocks. Derrick Favors registered 17 points, six rebounds and an assist. George Hill and Rodney Hood turned in matching 14-point efforts, with the former also dishing out seven assists and recording two steals, and the latter posting four rebounds and two assists. Joe Ingles and Alec Burks led the second unit with a pair of eight-point tallies.

The Magic continue their road trip with a Monday afternoon showdown against the Denver Nuggets, while the Jazz travel to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Monday evening.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 102-93, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday. 

The Sixers (12-25) have seemingly been allergic to winning streaks for the last few seasons, but Joel Embiid and an improving roster are quickly proving to be immune to the frailties of years past. Friday, Embiid spearheaded his team's first three-game winning streak in three seasons by leading all scorers with 24 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, an assist, three blocks and two steals. The third-year big man got to the foul line an impressive 14 times, parlaying 12 of those visits into points. Four other teammates joined him in posting double digits in the scoring column, and Philadelphia shot an impressive 47.4 percent from the field overall. They were just as effective on the other side of the ball, holding the Hornets (20-20) to 32.9 percent and 26.1 percent success rates from the floor and three-point range, respectively.

Charlotte was led by the returning Nicolas Batum (knee), who posted 19 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Backcourt mate Kemba Walker was right behind with 17 points, four rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals. Cody Zeller made an impressive return himself from a multi-game absence from a concussion, tallying a 16-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist, two steals and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist contributed a 12-point, 12-rebound double-double of his own, while also dishing out four assists and recording a steal and a block. Marvin Williams rounded things out for the first unit with eight points, two boards and a steal.

Dario Saric was actually second on the Sixers with a bench-leading 15 points, which he complemented with six rebounds, two assists and a steal. Ersan Ilyasova went for 12 points, three rebounds, an assist and two steals. Robert Covington registered 11 points, six rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Sergio Rodriguez outperformed starter T.J. McConnell in a reserve role, totaling 11 points, four assists, a rebound and two steals. In turn, McConnell could only muster four points, although he did dish out eight assists, haul in three rebounds and record three steals. Nik Stauskas supplied eight points, four boards and an assist.

The Hornets remain on the road and travel to Beantown for a Monday night tussle with the Boston Celtics, while the Sixers visit the Nation's Capital for a showdown with the Washington Wizards on Saturday evening.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 132-113, at Air Canada Centre on Friday. 

The Raptors (26-13) likely strolled into Friday night's contest with a healthy degree of confidence, considering the Nets (8-31) checked in with only one road victory on the season, as well as the NBA's worst defense in terms of points allowed. However, Brooklyn approached the game with a very different mindset, and as a result, found themselves with only a one-point deficit (90-89) entering the fourth quarter. That's when Toronto seemingly woke up, opening the period on an 11-0 run and outscoring their visitors by a 42-24 margin over the final 12 minutes overall. The Raptors finished the night with a stellar 53.6 percent success rate from the field, helping to offset an even better shooting night from the Nets, who shot 46.5 percent overall, as well as 47.2 percent from three-point range. 

Brooklyn saw Bojan Bogdanovic lead the way with 23 points, which he supplemented with four rebounds and two assists. Brook Lopez managed 20 points, five assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Joe Harris produced 11 points, four rebounds and a steal in a start at shooting guard, while Spencer Dinwiddie supplied 10 points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal. Justin Hamilton led the second unit with 11 points, two assists, two rebounds and a steal. Quincy Acy and Randy Foye were productive in reserve roles as well with matching nine-point efforts.

DeMar DeRozan's 28 points paced the Raptors, a total that he complemented with four rebounds and two assists. Kyle Lowry followed with 20 points, six boards, six assists, two steals and two blocks. DeMarre Carroll enjoyed one of his best games of the season, posting an 18-point, 11-rebound double-double, with 10 of those boards coming on the defensive glass. Jonas Valanciunas generated a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist, a steal and a block. Lucas Nogueira got the start at power forward and totaled 10 points, nine rebounds, two assists and four blocks. Cory Joseph led the bench with 16 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two steals, while Terrence Ross supplied 12 points in a reserve role as well.

The Nets head back home to face off with the Houston Rockets on Sunday evening, while the Raptors remain home to face off with the New York Knicks on Sunday afternoon.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Miami Heat, 116-108, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday.

A Milwaukee blowout was the expected result with the recent form of these two teams and a wire-to-wire win indicates just who the better team was. The Bucks took a 12-point lead after the first quarter and the game never got within seven points after that. Rebounding was the glaring difference, with Milwaukee winning that battle, 46-27. The Bucks were lights-out shooting too, hitting 50 percent from the field and 60 percent from three-point range. 

The Heat (11-30) are in a world of troubles right now, as they've now lost 10 of their last 11 games. It was a team effort for Miami, as they had six players score in double figures, with no one surpassing 19 points. Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside each scored 19, as Dragic added three rebounds and three assists, while Whiteside provided nine rebounds and two assists. James Johnson was huge off the bench, as he tallied 10 points and 12 assists. Tyler Johnson was the leading scorer off the bench, collecting 14 points, five assists and three steals. 

The Bucks (20-18) have now won five of their last seven games, as they continue to climb up the Eastern Conference ladder. Jabari Parker led the team in scoring, as he accrued 24 points, five rebounds and two assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the player of the game, accumulating 19 points, eight rebounds and six assists on 8-of-12 shooting.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Houston Rockets, 110-105, at Toyota Center on Friday.

In a battle between two of the Western Conference elite, this game was full of swings. Houston actually led by 13 at the half, before the Grizzlies rode a 59-41 second half to come back and win. The Rockets were let down by their shooting, as they hit just 40 percent from the field and went 10-of-41 from three-point range. Memphis shot very well, as they went 54 percent from the field. Rebounding was a huge factor for the Grizzlies too, winning that battle, 45-31.

The Grizzlies (25-17) committed a season-high 22 turnovers in this game, but they were able to prevail with a huge comeback win. Tony Allen was the star, as he led the team with 22 points, adding four rebounds and three assists on 9-of-10 from the field. Mike Conley was second on the team, providing 17 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Marc Gasol did commit six turnovers, but accrued 14 points, six rebounds and six assists on 6-of-9 from the field. Zach Randolph was huge off the bench, totaling 16 points and 12 rebounds, en route to a double-double.

The Rockets (31-11) have now lost two-straight games, which marks their first losing streak of the season. James Harden once again carried the load, as he collected 27 points, three rebounds and nine assists. Eric Gordon was second on the team in scoring, as he dropped 13 points off the bench. Trevor Ariza amassed 12 points and nine rebounds. Ryan Anderson had a game to forget, as he went 1-of-8 from three-point range, while failing to record a rebound, an assist or a defensive statistic. Those four players combined to go 7-of-30 from three-point range in the defeat.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves earned their third straight win, as they defeated the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder, 96-86, at Target Center on Friday evening. 

After the Timberwolves won the first quarter, the Thunder battled back to take a 50-45 lead into halftime. However, the Timberwolves were not deterred, as they came out of the dressing room with a fire lit beneath them. They fought to regain the lead with 6:24 left in the third and did not look back, leading the entire fourth quarter, while stretching the deficit to as many as 14 in the quarter. 

This marks the third win in a row for the Timberwolves (14-26), who have now knocked off two of the more dangerous teams in the league, defeating Houston and Oklahoma City in the matter of a few days. Despite being notoriously poor in second halves early in the season, the Timberwolves used a 51-36 second half to bury the Thunder in this one. Karl-Anthony Towns led the charge, with a game-high 29 points, to go along with 17 rebounds, three blocks, two steals and one assist, in 37 minutes. Andrew Wiggins added 19 points, while Ricky Rubio chipped in 14 points and dished 14 assists. The Timberwolves gave up 16 turnovers, but forced 19 out of their opponent, while they shot 45.3 percent from the field and managed to hold the Thunder to only 38.8 percent. The T-Wolves are now 9-13 at home and can look ahead to their next game on Sunday in Dallas. 

Meanwhile, the Thunder (24-17) saw their three-game win streak come to an end, as they were stifled by the determined Timberwolves. The Thunder struggled from long range, going only 3-of-20. Russell Westbrook had a quiet night in the points column, by his standards that is, as he finished with 21 points. Westbrook added 12 assists and 11 rebounds to notch his 19th triple-double of the season, which is a career-high for him. Enes Kanter continued his solid play, as he added 21 points, in 30 minutes off the bench, while the only other player to score in double digits for the Thunder was Victor Oladipo, who finished with 19. The Thunder will look to bounce back as they take on the Kings in Sacramento on Sunday, which will mark the second game of their current six-game road trip.

												The Boston Celtics hung on to defeat the host Atlanta Hawks, 103-101, at Phillips Arena on Friday evening. 

After a strong 28-18 first quarter, the Celtics let up a bit in the second, allowing the Hawks to pull within four points heading into halftime. The Celtics came out of the locker room firing on all cylinders and pushed the lead back up to 13 heading into the fourth. However, the Hawks were not done yet as they rallied back with a 34-23 run in the fourth quarter, capped off by a Paul Millsap jumper to tie the game up at 101, with 25 seconds to go. The Celtics had the answer though, in the form of a 5-foot-9 point guard, as Isaiah Thomas fearlessly knocked down a 19-foot jumper, with two seconds remaining to give Boston the lead and ultimately seal the win. 

This marks the fifth win in six games for the Celtics (25-15), as they hang on tight to their third-place position in the Eastern Conference. Isaiah Thomas has been leading the charge all season and this game was no different, as he poured in 13 of his team-high 28 points in the fourth quarter. Thomas had help though, as Kelly Olynyk poured in a season-high 26 points on 9-of-11 shooting, in 32 minutes off the bench. Jae Crowder chipped in 18 points, while the only other Celtics player to score in double digits was Al Horford, who added 10. Horford had a relatively quiet game in his return to his old stomping ground, but the fact that his new team came away with the win is enough. The Celtics move to 13-9 on the road, and will head back home to play host to the Hornets on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the Hawks (22-17) saw their seven-game win streak come to an end, as the visiting Celtics stole one from them at home. Atlanta had five players score in double digits, including Tim Hardaway Jr. and Paul Millsap, who each finished with a team-high 23 points. Dwight Howard added 11 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while Malcolm Delaney added 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting, including 3-of-3 from long range, in 27 minutes off the bench. The Hawks move to 10-8 at home this season and will look to bounce back, as they play host to the Bucks on Sunday.

												The visiting Orlando Magic took down the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, 115-109.

Orlando (17-24) got off to a hot start in Portland, establishing a double-digit lead by the end of the first quarter. Center Nikola Vucevic helped power the Magic's stellar offense, scoring a team-high 30 points to go with 10 rebounds. It was an excellent night for the Magic on the offensive end, as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and 55 percent from beyond the arc. Five players scored in double digits, including two off the bench. Power forward Serge Ibaka added his own double-double, scoring 13 along with 10 rebounds.  

Portland (18-24) managed to take care of the ball effectively and force turnovers, but struggled when shooting the ball. The team hit just 40 percent of its shots and 29 percent of its three-pointers. Star Damian Lillard returned to peak form on Friday with 34 points and eight rebounds. Guard C.J. McCollum added a stellar 26 points. However, the rest of Portland's starting five struggled particularly badly on the offensive end, going a combined 8-of-26 from the field.

The Magic will see Utah on Saturday, while the Trail Blazers will visit Washington on Monday.

												The visiting Cleveland Cavaliers took down the Sacramento Kings on Friday, 120-108.

Cleveland (29-10) snapped a surprising two-game losing streak with the convincing win on Friday. The Cavs had dropped both games since trading for veteran sharpshooter Kyle Korver, but picked up the win against the middling Kings. The Cavaliers' big three played to each of their strengths on Friday. Kevin Love posted a double-double and led the team with a whopping 18 rebounds, while LeBron James dished out 15 assists and Kyrie Irving scored a team-high 26 points. Five Cavaliers scored in double figures, including Korver, who came off the bench for 18.

Sacramento (16-23) has struggled lately, having now lost six of its last eight games. On Friday, the Kings were once again led by superstar DeMarcus Cousins. Cousins scored 26 points and dished out 11 assists while pulling down eight rebounds. As a whole, the Kings were superb when shooting the ball, hitting 52 percent of their shots. However, they could not match the Cavs from deep, hitting only nine three-pointers to Cleveland's 15.

												The Utah Jazz completely dismantled the visiting Detroit Pistons on Friday, 110-77.

Utah (25-16) was firing on all cylinders on Friday, excelling on both ends of the floor. After a stagnant 14-point first quarter, Utah quickly ran away with the rest of the game. The team drained 16 three-pointers while shooting over 53 percent from the field and 51 percent from beyond the arc. On defense, the Jazz came away with 10 steals and blocked six shots while holding their opponent to under 40 percent shooting from the field. They also crushed the Pistons on the glass, out-rebounding Detroit 48-35. On offense, the team's success was due largely to a combination of guards George Hill and Rodney Hood, who scored 22 and 27, respectively. The duo was responsible for 12 of the three-pointers that made up Utah's barrage of shots from deep. Defensively, elite rim protector Rudy Gobert anchored one of Utah's most impressive outings of the season. Gobert led the team with 11 rebounds and blocked three shots.

It was a miserable game for the Pistons (18-24), who had suffered a 20-point loss at the hands of Golden State the night before. Detroit was simply suffocated on offense, shooting just over 39 percent from the field and hitting only six three-pointers. The Pistons' top scorer was Tobias Harris, who scored only 13 on 4-of-12 shooting. Only three Pistons scored in double digits. While it was an impressive individual rebounding night for Andre Drummond, who walked away with 19 boards, the team was massively out-rebounded.  

Utah will host the Magic on Saturday, while the Pistons will visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Indiana Pacers, 140-112, at O2 Arena in London, England on Thursday.

In the first NBA game of the season across seas, the Nuggets put it to the Pacers in this 28-point blowout. Denver actually led for 47 minutes of this game, as the Pacers one and only lead came early in the second quarter. The middle quarters were the difference in the game, with Denver outscoring Indiana, 76-47, in that 24-minute stretch. The Nuggets offense was on point, as they went 57 percent from the field and recorded 37 assists in the win. Rebounding was a huge factor as well, with Denver winning that battle, 48-34. The Nuggets also hit 15 three-pointers and scored 70 points in the paint.

The Pacers (20-19) came into this game extremely hot, but their defense clearly didn't travel with them across seas. Jeff Teague and Paul George were the only starters in double figures, as Teague led them with 14 points. He also added nine assists, while George swiped away four steals. C.J. Miles was the leading scorer, as he dropped 20 points, going 6-of-7 from three-point range off the bench. Monta Ellis, Aaron Brooks and Kevin Seraphin all scored in double figures off the bench as well, as garbage time started in the third quarter. 

The Nuggets (15-23) had lost five-straight headed into this matchup, so a 28-point win is just what the doctor ordered. Nikola Jokic was the player of the game, accumulating 22 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Wilson Chandler wasn't far behind, tallying 21 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Danilo Gallinari provided 18 points of his own. Gary Harris also shot well, accruing 16 points, five rebounds and six assists. Those four starters actually combined to go 28-of-47 from the field, with each of them shooting 55 percent or higher. Kenneth Faried was a nice spark off the bench too, totaling 15 points and nine rebounds. 

Both teams return to action on Monday, as the Pacers host the New Orleans Pelicans, while the Nuggets host the Orlando Magic.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 104-95, at Barclays Center on Thursday.

The Pelicans (16-24) learned earlier in the day that Anthony Davis would miss the contest with the hip injury that he suffered after a flagrant foul by the Knicks' Kyle O'Quinn on Monday. However, that didn't deter them from notching their sixth road victory of the season on the strength of standout efforts from Davis' replacement Terrence Jones and the surging Tyreke Evans off the bench. The two combined for more than half of the Pelicans' points on the night, and New Orleans also forced 16 turnovers from the Nets (8-30), which continue to give the ball away at the league's highest clip.

Evans led all scorers with 29 points, which he supplemented with four rebounds, three assists, four steals and a block over 28 minutes. Jones posted a 24-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a steal. Jrue Holiday tallied 21 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals. Solomon Hill went for 14 points, 10 boards, three assists and a pair of steals. Not all was clicking on the New Orleans side, however, as Omer Asik received only five minutes and went scoreless, while Buddy Hield compiled just five points, five rebounds and an assist over 24 minutes, shooting just 2-of-9 from the field and 1-of-6 from three-point range.

Brook Lopez paced the Nets with 20 points, six rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block, but also committed a game-high six turnovers. Joe Harris produced 15 points, two rebounds and two assists. Bojan Bogdanovic supplied 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal, while Trevor Booker generated a modest eight points but complemented them with 12 boards, four assists, a steal and a block. Sean Kilpatrick led the second unit with 18 points, seven boards, an assist and a steal, and Caris LeVert was productive in a reserve role as well with 10 points.

The Pelicans continue on the road and visit the Chicago Bulls on Saturday afternoon, while the Nets head north of the border to tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Friday night.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 104-89, at Madison Square Garden on Thursday.

The Knicks (18-22) haven't exactly caught many breaks over the last two-plus weeks, having lost nine of their last 10. They were on the right side of Lady Luck for a change Thursday, however, as the Bulls (19-21) were without Jimmy Butler and Nikola Mirotic due to illness. The Knicks were a bit on the short-handed side themselves, as Kristaps Porzingis sat out with a sore Achilles. New York was better able to cope with the absence of one of their important pieces, though, as Carmelo Anthony stepped up to deliver a game-high 23 points, and Joakim Noah posted a 12-point, 15-rebound double-double against his former teammates. The Knicks also played stellar defense, holding the visitors to respective 39.8 percent and 16.7 percent success rates from the field and three-point range.

In Butler's absence, it was Dwyane Wade who paced the Bulls, tallying 22 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Taj Gibson registered a near double-double with 12 points and nine boards. Robin Lopez totaled 10 points, seven rebounds and a pair of blocks. Paul Zipser drew the start in Butler's stead and contributed seven points, five rebounds and two assists. Jerian Grant totaled 14 points, four assists, three rebounds and a steal to lead the bench, while Cristiano Felicio offered 13 points, five boards and a block over 24 minutes in a reserve role.

Anthony added nine rebounds, six assists and a steal to his aforementioned scoring total. Derrick Rose checked in behind him on the starting five with 17 points, four boards and three assists. Mindaugas Kuzminskas mustered 19 points, four rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block to lead the second unit. Kyle O'Quinn supplied a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three assists and four blocks in just 17 minutes off the bench.

												The host San Antonio Spurs blew out the Los Angeles Lakers, 134-94, at AT&T Center on Thursday. 

The Spurs (31-8) jumped out to a major lead to start the game, holding a double-digit advantage in the first quarter. They only built on that lead from there, shooting a whopping 60 percent as a team en route to their highest-scoring game of the season. Reigning Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard led the team with 31 points on 10-of-13 shooting and came away with a pair of steals in 26 minutes. Veteran big man Pau Gasol added 22 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists. Everything seemed to be clicking for the Spurs, as the team dished out 31 assists and held a 46-29 rebounding advantage.

Los Angeles (15-28) lost its second straight in ugly fashion on Thursday. The team shot only 41 percent with six three-pointers and was massively out-rebounded. Power forward Julius Randle led the team with 22 points, but the remainder of the starting five combined for just 20. Bench guard Jordan Clarkson also put together a decent outing, shooting 6-of-11 for 14 points. Los Angeles simply was lost on defense, however, as the team allowed 28 or more points in every quarter.  

Both teams will play on Saturday, with the Spurs visiting Phoenix and the Lakers taking on the Clippers.

												The visiting Dallas Mavericks defeated the Phoenix Suns, 113-108, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Thursday.

Dallas (12-27) was able to pull away with a strong start to the second half. All five Dallas starters scored in double digits, with the lead coming from veteran point guard Deron Williams. Williams scored 23 points to go with a team-high 12 assists. Forward Harrison Barnes also had a strong outing, scoring 22 points. As a whole, the Mavericks shot an impressive 48 percent from the field and buried 15 three-pointers. The team also dished out an impressive 29 assists.

Phoenix (12-27) was kept afloat by strong play from sophomore guard Devin Booker. Booker scored 39 points, including six three-pointers, two of which came with under 45 seconds remaining in the game. Unfortunately for the Suns, Booker's cold-blooded performance was not enough for the win. The team struggled to maintain possession all game, finishing with 19 turnovers. Even in the face of the loss, however, Phoenix was able to attain a stellar advantage on the boards, out-rebounding Dallas, 47-32.

Phoenix will host the Spurs on Saturday, while Dallas will see the Timberwolves on Sunday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Detroit Pistons, 127-107, at Oracle Arena on Thursday. 

The Warriors were heavy favorites headed into this matchup and they left no doubt who the better team was. It wasn't lopsided throughout though, as there were 11 ties and 21 lead changes in the first half. That's when Golden State turned it on though, outscoring Detroit, 67-49, in the second half. The Warriors offense was on point, shooting 56 percent from the field, 51 percent from three-point range and recording 39 assists. Three-point shooting really killed Detroit, as they went just 6-of-28 from long distance. 

The Pistons (18-23) have struggled on the road all season and a matchup against Golden State is the last thing they wanted to see. Marcus Morris was Detroit's best player, as he tallied 21 points, five rebounds and three assists. Andre Drummond recorded another double-double, totaling 12 points and 10 rebounds. Tobias Harris got the start and amassed 18 points and four rebounds. Boban Marjanovic was the only bench player in double figures, amassing 13 points and 11 rebounds on 5-of-7 from the field. 

The Warriors (34-6) have been taking it to teams all season and this blowout win was no different. Kevin Durant led the team in scoring, accruing 25 points, six rebounds and nine assists on 10-of-15 shooting. Steph Curry was just as good, collecting 24 points, six assists and five steals. Klay Thompson dropped 23 points of his own. Draymond Green failed to hit a shot, but he provided nine rebounds and 13 assists. Ian Clark and Shaun Livingston each scored in double figures off the bench.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the New York Knicks, 98-97, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

Both teams engaged in a nip-and-tuck battle throughout four quarters which rather fittingly came down to the closing seconds. Down 97-96 with six seconds remaining, the Sixers (11-25) started their comeback with a Gerald Henderson defensive rebound off a Kristaps Porzingis missed 23-foot three-pointer. T.J. McConnell eventually ended up with the ball in his hand and put up a successful 12-foot shot attempt as the clock hit zeros, sealing the home victory. 

Carmelo Anthony led the way for the Knicks (17-22) with 28 points, two rebounds, an assist and three blocks. Derrick Rose, fresh off his much talked-about one-game absence, was right behind with 25 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal. The remainder of the starting five, Courtney Lee, Porzingis and Joakim Noah, underwhelmed, as they were only able to produce a trio of seven-point efforts apiece. Kyle O'Quinn led the bench with a 10-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included three assists, two steals and two blocks. 

Joel Embiid paced the Sixers with a 21-point, 14-rebound double-double with an assist, a steal and a block. Ersan Ilyasova supplied 16 points, five assists and four rebounds. Robert Covington and Nerlens Noel turned in matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, four assists and a steal, and the latter tallying eight rebounds, an assist and two steals. Gerald Henderson was productive in a reserve role as well with 12 points, two boards and an assist. McConnell compiled a modest but full stat line of eight points, seven assists, six rebounds and two steals. 

The Knicks head back home to face off with the Chicago Bulls on Thursday evening, while the Sixers remain home to tangle with the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 103-95, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday. 

Wire-to-wire wins in the NBA usually indicate a blowout, but that was far from the case here. In fact, the Thunder never led by more than 12, as this was a single-digit game for well over 40 minutes. Oklahoma City did most of their damage in the first half, as they took an 11-point lead into the locker room. Memphis struggled with their shots all night, as they went 41 percent from the field, 57 percent from the free-throw line and 29 percent from three-point range. Defensive rebounding was key for Oklahoma City, winning that battle, 42-26. 

The Grizzlies (24-17) had a tough task against the Thunder and just couldn't quite make a big enough run to grab that elusive lead. Mike Conley led the team, accruing 22 points, four rebounds, six assists and three steals. Chandler Parsons had one of his best games for Memphis, dropping 14 points in 18 minutes. Zach Randolph was huge off the bench, amassing 14 points and nine rebounds. Marc Gasol went just 4-of-12 from the field, but finished with nine points, seven rebounds, seven assists, two steals and two blocks. Memphis will be in Houston for their next game on Friday, as they look to slow down a potent Rockets offense. 

The Thunder (24-16) have now won three-straight games, as Russell Westbrook continues to add to his historic numbers. Westbrook recorded another triple-double, accumulating 24 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists. His efficiency numbers weren't pretty though, as he committed six turnovers and went 6-of-19 from the field and 0-of-7 from three-point range. Enes Kanter was second on the team, as he totaled 19 points and 13 rebounds off the bench. Steven Adams provided 12 points and eight rebounds, while playing elite defense against Gasol. Victor Oladipo was second among starters, collecting 16 points, three rebounds and two assists. The Thunder start a six-game road trip on Friday against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

												The visiting Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Houston Rockets, 119-105, Wednesday at Target Center.

The Timberwolves (13-26) were without one of their young stars in Zach LaVine (hip) in Wednesday's showdown with one of the NBA's best teams, but it ended up not mattering, as Minnesota managed to lead from start to finish on the backs of their other two stars, Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. Wiggins led the way scoring, putting up 28 points in 38 minutes, while Towns managed to post a monster double-double of 23 points and 18 rebounds. Shabazz Muhammed also added a stellar performance off the bench, as he scored 20 points and grabbed seven rebounds in 30 minutes as a reserve. As a team, it was a great all-around effort for the Wolves, as six players managed to score in double-figures Wednesday night. 

As for the Rockets (31-10), the loss ended their nine-game win streak, but even in defeat, MVP-candidate James Harden still managed to put up spectacular numbers, posting 30 points, 12 assists and six rebounds in 39 minutes. Their problems stemmed from their lack of bench production, however, as without Eric Gordon (toe) for the second straight game, the bench lacked its usual luster and produced just 29 total points. The loss is just a minor scratch on the Rockets' season however, as the team has now put win streaks of nine and ten games together over the past month and remain just a half-game behind the Spurs for first place in the Southwest Division. 

Up next, the Timberwolves will look to extend their win streak to three games when they take on the Thunder on Friday, while the Rockets look to start a new win streak Friday against the Grizzlies.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Washington Wizards, 117-108, at TD Garden on Wednesday.

A battle of two offensively proficient squads went according to script, starting from the opening tip. A breakneck-paced opening 12 minutes saw the Celtics (24-15) emerge with a 36-35 edge. The Wizards (19-19) proceeded to take the next two periods by a 50-47 margin, setting up the decisive fourth quarter. Boston pulled away with a 34-point effort to close matters out in a game that featured a pair of spectacular dueling performances from Bradley Beal and Isaiah Thomas. The former led the Wizards with 35 points, which he supplemented with four assists, two rebounds, a steal and a block, while the latter provided 38 points, 20 of which came in the fourth quarter, along with six boards and five assists. Washington took better care of the ball, with their seven turnovers representing only half of the Celtics' total; however, Boston outperformed the visitors from the field, with their 50.6 percent success rate significantly outpacing the Wizards' 42.9 percent tally.

Otto Porter, Jr. was second behind Beal with 20 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Markieff Morris registered 14 points, nine boards, four assists and a pair of steals. Marcin Gortat produced a near double-double with 10 points, nine boards and two assists. John Wall endured one of the worst shooting nights of his career, supplying just nine points on a 4-of-21 effort from the field. He did dish out 10 assists, while also recording three steals and a block. Jason Smith paced the bench with 13 points, five boards and an assist.

Jae Crowder checked in behind Thomas with 20 points, five rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Al Horford compiled 16 points, nine rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Marcus Smart drew another start in place of Avery Bradley (Achilles), managing nine points, four rebounds and four assists. Terry Rozier led the second unit with 11 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal.

The Wizards remain home to tangle with the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night, while the Celtics travel to Atlanta for a Friday evening showdown with the Hawks.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers beat the visiting Orlando Magic, 105-96, at Staples Center on Wednesday.

Los Angeles (27-14) has managed to stay afloat despite the absence of star forward Blake Griffin (knee). Griffin's absence has not kept the Clippers from winning their last five games, including Wednesday's tilt against the Magic. Guard J.J. Redick led the team with 22 points against Orlando, knocking down three three-pointers along the way. The Clippers shot an impressive 51 percent from the field on the night and hit nine three-pointers. Los Angeles also managed a significant rebounding advantage, due in part to a 20-board outing from center DeAndre Jordan. Jordan added two steals and three blocks on the defensive end.

Orlando (16-24), meanwhile, is heading in the opposite direction. The Magic have lost four straight and sit squarely out of the current Eastern Conference playoff picture. Wednesday did see a promising performance from forward Aaron Gordon, who had a team-high 28 points and four three-pointers. As a team, however, Orlando struggled to find the basket. The Magic shot just 42 percent and hit only six three-pointers on the night.  

The Magic will visit Portland on Friday, while the Clippers will face the Lakers on Saturday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 102-86, at Moda Center on Wednesday. 

The Trail Blazers (18-23) outscored the Cavaliers (28-10) in every quarter, and were able to contain Cleveland's big three of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with transition defense and contested jump shots. Allen Crabbe's 24 points off the bench, with a lights out 9-of-11 shooting, proved to be the main difference maker throughout the contest. Across 31 minutes of action, Crabbe simply could not miss, which made up for a still sluggish offensive return from Damian Lillard. The star point guard for the Blazers turned in 14 points, three rebounds and three assists, and continued to defer the scoring to the hot hand of C.J. McCollum. The Blazers shooting guard, who has been averaging over 30.0 points per game over the last seven contests, added 27 points on 11-of-20 shooting. 

The Cavaliers shot just 34.1 percent from the field as a unit, and while LeBron James' box score numbers stood out, the actual game plan seemed to lack communication. Cleveland turned the ball over 15 times, compared to that of the Blazers, who made only nine errors throughout the game. James went on to finish with 20 points, 11 rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined for 28 points. 

Both teams play on Friday, as the Blazers host the Orlando Magic, while the Cavaliers visit the Sacramento Kings.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Chicago Bulls, 101-99, at Verizon Center on Tuesday.

The Bulls (19-20), which play a total of five games this week, announced before the game that both Jimmy Butler (illness) and Dwyane Wade (rest) would sit out Tuesday's contest, which automatically made them a sizable underdog on the road against a Wizards (19-18) squad that was at full strength. However, it was clear from the onset that Chicago had a different mindset, as they walloped their hosts by a 36-26 margin in the first quarter. They maintained their advantage through the second period, leading to a 61-48 halftime edge. However, intermission must have served as a wake-up call for Washington, which roared out of the gates in the third quarter and doubled up their feisty visitors, 32-16. Ultimately, however, it all came down to the best player on the court, John Wall. The Wizards' point guard led all scorers with 26 points, and his 16-foot basket with five seconds remaining snapped a 99-99 deadlock and provided the home team with the final margin of victory.

Chicago was paced by Denzel Valentine, who went for 19 points, two rebounds, two assists and two steals in 30 minutes off the bench.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Boston Celtics, 114-106, at Air Canada Centre on Tuesday. 

Throughout his first seven seasons, DeMar DeRozan had managed two performances of over 40 points. In what has already proven to be a stellar 2016-17 campaign, the All-Star shooting guard has already accomplished the feat on three occasions, with Tuesday night being one of those. DeRozan led all scorers with 41 points, which he complemented with 13 boards and two steals. The effort included a 16-of-29 tally from the field, and even a rather rare three-pointer on two attempts from beyond the arc. Toronto (25-13) was hot collectively from long range, and it proved to be the difference in the game. Both teams equaled the others' solid 47.1 percent success rate from the field, yet the Raptors managed to drain their 22 three-point attempts at a 45.5 percent clip. The Celtics (23-15), meanwhile, noticeably lagged behind with a 33.3 percent figure. 

Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston with 27 points, seven assists and a rebound. Marcus Smart logged another start for Avery Bradley (Achilles) and went for 16 points, five assists, four rebounds, four steals and a block. Al Horford managed a near double-double with 14 points, nine rebounds, four assists and a steal. Jae Crowder and Amir Johnson combined for just 13 points, but Gerald Green and Kelly Olynyk helped make up for the void off the bench. Green led the second unit with 14 points and five rebounds, and Olynyk provided 13 points, four boards, an assist and a block.

DeRozan's usual partner-in-crime, Kyle Lowry, backed him up with 24 points, nine assists, four rebounds, two steals and a block. Jonas Valanciunas contributed an impressive 18-point, 23-rebound double-double that also included a pair of blocks. DeMarre Carroll supplied 11 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Patrick Patterson drew the start but went scoreless over 21 minutes. Lucas Nogueira and Cory Joseph paced the bench with matching seven-point efforts.

The Celtics return home to face off with the Washington Wizards on Wednesday evening, while the Raptors remain home and next tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 117-97, at Barclay's Center on Tuesday. 

These two teams came into this matchup on the opposite ends of six-game runs, as the Hawks added to their win streak, while the Nets continued their losing streak. Atlanta took care of business in the first half, carrying an 18-point lead into the locker room. This was actually a wire-to-wire win for the Hawks, as they held a double-digit lead for the final 30-plus minutes. Defense was key, as they held Brooklyn to 40 percent shooting, while forcing them to commit 17 turnovers. In addition, Atlanta recorded 11 steals and 12 blocks. The Hawks won the shooting, rebounding, assisting and turnover differentials in a dominant performance.

Atlanta (22-16) has now won seven-straight games, as they continue to revive their season. Dennis Schroder was the catalyst, leading the team with 19 points and 10 assists. Dwight Howard recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points and 16 rebounds. Paul Millsap accumulated 14 points, eight rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Kris Humphries led the bench in scoring and rebounding, amassing 13 points and eight boards. The Hawks are off until Friday when they host the Boston Celtics for their next game.

This gives Brooklyn (8-29) a seventh-straight loss, adding to their league-worst record. Brook Lopez led the team in scoring, dropping 20 points on 8-of-14 from the field. Bojan Bogdanovic was the team's best player, accruing 16 points, six rebounds and four assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson got his first start in over a month and contributed 10 points and seven rebounds. Sean Kilpatrick and Caris LeVert each scored in double figures off the bench. Brooklyn will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday for their next game.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 121-114, at Toyota Center on Tuesday. 

While this scoreline was close, Houston led for nearly the entirety of this game. In fact, Charlotte never led by more than one point, as they held the lead for less than a minute in total. It was a tale of two halves, as the Rockets outscored the Hornets, 67-47, in the first half, with Charlotte responding with a, 67-54, second half. Both teams relied heavily on long distance shooting, as they combined for 36 three-point makes in this shootout. Fastbreak points were the most decisive statistic, with the Rockets winning that battle, 25-2. They also took advantage of the whistle, taking 33 free-throws, while holding Charlotte to just nine free-throw attempts. 

Charlotte (20-19) had to play this game without Nicolas Batum (knee) and they nearly pulled out the upset win. Kemba Walker carried the load, collecting 25 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. Frank Kaminsky was second on the team, as he tallied 22 points and three rebounds off the bench. Marvin Williams provided 16 points and eight rebounds as the starting power forward. Marco Belinelli and Spencer Hawes came off the bench to combine for 31 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists as well.

Houston (31-9) has now won 20 of their last 22 games, as they continue to rise in the standings. James Harden recorded yet another triple-double, accumulating 40 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists. Trevor Ariza was second on the team, accruing 16 points, four rebounds and three assists. Patrick Beverley was the only starter who failed to reach double figures in scoring, but he still contributed eight points, eight rebounds and five assists. Nene Hilario and Corey Brewer combined for 25 points and 10 rebounds to lead the bench.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 109-107, at AT&T Center on Tuesday. 

The Spurs were expected to win this game easily, but Milwaukee fought back for a huge road win. The Bucks really turned it on in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Spurs, 26-18. The offense was extremely efficient, as Milwaukee shot 52 percent from the field, while recording 32 assists. San Antonio actually led for over 42 minutes of this game, as the Bucks never led by more than four points. Scoring down low was huge for Milwaukee as well, as they outscored San Antonio, 52-38 in the paint.

Milwaukee (19-18) was a big underdog headed into this game and with Giannis Antetokounmpo leaving early because of a lingering illness, a win seemed nearly impossible. Michael Beasley stepped up big time though, as he led the team with 28 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and three blocks off the bench. Jabari Parker led the starters, tallying 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Malcolm Brogdon got another start at point guard and accumulated 17 points, six rebounds and six assists. Antetokounmpo went scoreless in nine minutes of action.

San Antonio (30-8) has been dominant this season, but losses like this simply don't make sense. Kawhi Leonard did all he could to keep the Spurs in this game, as he led the team with 30 points, seven rebounds, three steals and three blocks on 10-of-16 shooting. Tony Parker, Jonathan Simmons and Danny Green all finished with 14 points apiece, while Parker added seven dimes to his tally.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 100-92, Tuesday at Vivint Smart Home Arena.

LeBron James of the Cavaliers (28-9) came into Salt Lake City on Tuesday having not won there since 2010. That losing streak will extend at least one more year as the Jazz (24-16) managed to lead from wire-to-wire in what was a terrific defensive effort against an explosive Cleveland team. Offensively, though, it was Gordon Hayward who shined with a very efficient offensive performance, scoring a team-high 28 points on 10-of-12 shooting from the field and 4-of-5 shooting from behind the arc. Alongside Hayward, each of the other four Utah starters managed to score in double figures, and the starting unit accounted for 82 of the team's 100 points. 

For Cleveland, a stingy Jazz defense led to an uncharacteristically poor shooting night, as they finished shooting just 36.5 percent from the field and 29 percent from behind the arc. Two of the Cavaliers' big three were solid Tuesday, with James leading the way with 29 points, six rebounds, five assists and four steals, while Kyrie Irving scored 20 points of his own. Kevin Love, however, struggled, finishing with just 12 points and nine rebounds on a poor 4-of-14 shooting from the field. The loss ended what was a three-game road winning streak for the Cavaliers. 

Up next, the Jazz will look to build on Tuesday's victory on Thursday against the Pistons, while the Cavaliers will look to bounce back against the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 108-87, Tuesday at Staples Center. 

Tuesday's outing for the Trail Blazers (17-23) was a lot closer than the final score would make it seem, as Portland actually found themselves down by two points heading into halftime. Then, a dominant third quarter completely opened the game up and they never looked back. C.J. McCollum led the way with an excellent shooting performance, scoring a game-high 25 points on 10-of-18 shooting from the field. His running mate in the backcourt, Damian Lillard, was not too far behind, scoring 20 points on top of eight rebounds and six assists. It was a great shooting night for the Trail Blazers overall, as the team shot an impressive 50.6 percent from the field.

As for the Lakers (15-27), things did not go as smoothly after they put together a great performance in the first half. In the end, Luol Deng ended up as the only Los Angeles starter to score in double figures with his team-high 14 points, with Brandon Ingram scoring 12 points off the bench and Lou Williams adding 10 of his own. As a team, the Lakers shot horridly from both the field and the free throw line with percentages of 38.6 and 53.8, respectively. 

Up next, the Trail Blazers will head home Wednesday to play the Cavaliers, while the Lakers will head to San Antonio on Thursday to play the Spurs.

												The host Golden State Warriors beat the visiting Miami Heat on Tuesday, 107-95, at Oracle Arena.

Golden State (33-6) was able to pull out a win on Tuesday despite the absence of All-Star guard Klay Thompson (rest). Even with the sharpshooting Thompson out, the Warriors shot a stellar 11-of-27 from three-point range. Though Miami kept the score close for the majority of the game, the Warriors were able to hold advantages in shooting and rebounding. Golden State shot 45 percent from the field and had 48 rebounds on the night, despite a monster 20 boards from Miami center Hassan Whiteside. Kevin Durant led the team with 28 points, while reigning MVP Steph Curry scored 24 points to go with eight rebounds and nine assists.

Miami (11-29) saw superb play from recently-returned center Hassan Whiteside, but still walked away with the loss. In just his second game back after being held out with an eye injury, Whiteside scored 28 points on 13-of-17 shooting to go with 20 rebounds and two blocks. The Heat also saw strong play from their bench, with guard Tyler Johnson leading the second unit with 18 points. Forward James Johnson contributed 14, including a monster highlight dunk over the Warriors' Steph Curry. The Heat struggled mightily from beyond the arc, however, shooting just 6-of-30 from three-point range.

The Warriors will host the Pistons on Thursday, while the Heat will travel to Milwaukee on Friday.

												The host Sacramento Kings took down the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, 100-94, at Golden 1 Center.

Sacramento (16-22) trailed by double-digits at points in the second half, but mounted a major comeback with a 32-17 scoring advantage in the fourth quarter. Per usual, center DeMarcus Cousins managed to lead the Kings in seemingly every facet of the game. Cousins led the team with 24 points, 13 rebounds, and six assists, while also adding a steal and a block. The Kings were able to hold a substantial advantage on the glass, out-rebounding Detroit 46-35. Though Sacramento struggled at points with turnovers, the team was able to make up for it on offense with lights-out three-point shooting. The Kings hit 54 percent of their shots from beyond the arc.  

Detroit (18-22) was not as careless with the ball but struggled in multiple areas on Tuesday. The Pistons recorded just 14 assists on the night, relying heavily on transition offense and ISO ball to lead to scoring. On the defensive end, the team was able to limit scoring on the interior fairly effectively. This was largely due to strong play from All-Star center Andre Drummond, who recorded a whopping seven blocks to go with two steals and 12 rebounds. The Pistons were not as effective covering the perimeter, however, as the team allowed 13 three-pointers on the night.  

The Pistons will play the Warriors in Oakland on Thursday, while the Kings will host the Cavaliers on Friday.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the New York Knicks, 110-96, at Madison Square Garden on Monday. 

Anthony Davis is used to carrying the load for the Pelicans (15-24), but Monday's game was a particularly illustrative example of such. Davis exploded for 40 points, 18 rebounds, two assists and three blocks, impressively draining 14-of-22 shot attempts from the field and 11-of-12 attempts from the foul line. The All-Star forward may have been too effective for his own good, however, as he was forced from the contest after 29 minutes with a left hip injury sustained after a flagrant-2 foul by the Knicks' Kyle O'Quinn. Despite his early exit, as well as the fact that only three other Pelicans players hit double digits in the scoring column, New Orleans still managed the double-digit victory, in large part by shooting 48.2 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from three-point range. 

Buddy Hield was the only other member of the first unit with double-digit scoring, posting 11 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals. Jrue Holiday tallied nine points, seven assists, four rebounds and a steal. Dante Cunningham matched Holiday's point total and added three rebounds and a steal. Tyreke Evans paced the second unit with 12 points, while Terrence Jones went for 11 points in a reserve role as well.

The Knicks (17-21) were led by Brandon Jennings, who tallied 20 points in a start over Derrick Rose. He added five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Carmelo Anthony produced 18 points, six rebounds and an assist. Kristaps Porzingis had his hands full on defense against Davis throughout the night, likely leading to his modest totals of nine points, four rebounds, an assist and two blocks. Joakim Noah managed just four points but hauled in 10 rebounds and dished out a pair of assists. Justin Holiday and Lance Thomas led the bench with matching nine-point efforts, with each also adding a rebound. 

The Pelicans remain in the Empire State for their next contest, which comes on Thursday night against the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 109-94, at United Center on Monday.

In a game that was expected to be close, the Thunder gave it to the Bulls in this lopsided result. In fact, Oklahoma City won all of the first three quarters by at least six points, as they took a 22-point lead into the fourth quarter. Aside from Chicago grabbing the first lead of the game, the Thunder led for the final 45-plus minutes. All the statistics were one-sided, with the Thunder winning the shooting, rebounding and assisting differentials. The Thunder shot 57 percent from the field, while the Bulls barely cracked 40 percent shooting. In addition, Oklahoma City outscored Chicago 25-4 in fastbreak points and 60-36 in the paint.

The Thunder (23-16) were in a bit of a slide, so a road win against the Bulls is just what the doctor ordered. Russell Westbrook was once again the catalyst, accumulating 21 points, nine rebounds and 14 assists. Steven Adams led the team in scoring, totaling 22 points and five rebounds on 11-of-14 from the field. Enes Kanter was a nice spark off the bench, collecting 20 points and 11 rebounds on 9-of-11 shooting. On deck for Oklahoma City is a home matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. 

The Bulls (19-19) came into this game in the midst of a three-game winning streak, but that ended in rather embarrassing fashion. After winning player of the week last week, Jimmy Butler finished this game with one point, two rebounds and seven assists on 0-of-6 shooting, as he was clearly hampered by the sickness that made him questionable coming in. Dwyane Wade was the teams best player, tallying 22 points, four rebounds and six assists. Michael Carter-Williams was the only other starter in double figures, dropping 15 points and adding two assists. Cristiano Felicio got a bunch of garbage minutes and recorded an 11-point, 11-rebound double-double off the bench. Chicago will be in action again on Tuesday, as they play the Washington Wizards on the road.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 101-92, at Target Center on Monday. 

The Timberwolves (12-26) put an end to a four-game losing streak with Monday's victory, and it was thanks in large part to the monster performance put on by Karl-Anthony Towns. After scoring 20 points in the first quarter and outscoring the entire Mavericks (11-27) team by himself, Towns finished with a game-high 34 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and three blocks in 37 minutes. The big man's night was made even easier with Ricky Rubio shining as a facilitator, notching a double-double of his own with 13 points and 15 assists on top of five rebounds and five steals. The two helped the Timberwolves lead wire-to-wire Thursday, as the team overall shot a very impressive 56.3 percent from the field. 

As for the Mavericks, the loss leaves them alone at the very bottom of the Western Conference, but the defeat didn't come without a pair of great performances from their stars in the frontcourt. Harrison Barnes led the way with a team-high 30 points, while veteran Dirk Nowtizki posted 26 points, five rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes. Unfortunately for Dallas, they failed to get any other significant contributions elsewhere, with the other 10 Mavericks players who played combining to score just 36 points. And while Dallas managed to shoot an impressive 46 percent from behind the arc, their inability to get to the free throw line ended up hurting them, as they shot just 7-of-9 from the charity stripe. 

Up next, the Timberwolves will stay home Wednesday to play the Rockets, while the Mavericks will head home to take on the Suns on Thursday.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 105-95, at Barclays Center on Sunday.

The Sixers (10-25) checked in to Sunday's game with only three road victories in 14 tries, but a balanced offensive effort and opportunistic defense helped them improve that mark at the expense of the Nets (8-28). Joel Embiid, who'd tallied a career-high 33 points in the previous meeting between the two clubs, led the way once again with 20 points, while Robert Covington produced a 15-point, 11-rebound double-double. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia defense elicited 22 turnovers from the NBA's most mistake-prone team, which also played a pivotal part in the rare double-digit road win.

Embiid added five rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Covington also dished out an assist and recorded a game-high five steals, along with a block. Nik Stauskas totaled 15 points, five rebounds, two assists and a block. Ersan Ilyasova went for 14 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a block. Dario Saric paced the second unit with 18 points, five boards and a steal. 

Brook Lopez paced the Nets with a game-high 26 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Bojan Bogdanovic provided 12 points, eight boards, three assists and a steal. Isaiah Whitehead, Trevor Booker and Joe Harris combined for only nine points, but Justin Hamilton helped make up for it with 16 points, five rebounds and two blocks off the bench. Meanwhile, Sean Kilpatrick was productive again on the second unit, registering 10 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal. 

The Sixers head back home to face off with the New York Knicks on Wednesday night, while the Nets remain home and await the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday evening.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 107-101, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Sunday.

The Wizards (18-18) caught a break when Giannis Antetokounmpo was ruled out of Sunday's contest with an illness, but they still encountered a game Bucks (18-18) squad that was eager to defend their home court. Jabari Parker stepped up in his teammate's absence by scoring a game-high 28 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block. However, Bradley Beal practically countered Parker point-for-point, totaling a team-high 26 to help the Wizards stay a step ahead. The two teams' propensity for handing the ball to the opposition also played a pivotal part in neither being able to pull away from the other, as Washington was guilty of 19 turnovers, while Milwaukee committed 16 of their own. 

Beal supplemented his aforementioned scoring total with four rebounds, two assists and a block. Markieff Morris followed with 20 points, 10 rebounds, an assist and three steals, one of his most complete performances of the season. John Wall supplied 16 points, seven assists, three boards and a steal. Otto Porter turned in a typically full stat line of 13 points, seven rebounds, seven assists, two blocks and a steal. Kelly Oubre, Jr. led the second unit with 17 points, five boards, an assist and a steal.

Impressive rookie Malcolm Brogdon complemented Parker's effort with 22 points of his own, along with five assists, a rebound, three steals and a block. Tony Snell provided a modest seven points, while Mirza Teletovic, in the starting lineup as a result of Antetokounmpo's absence, registered just five points, four rebounds, two assists and a steal. Michael Beasley paced the bench with 18 points, a rebound and a steal, while Greg Monroe provided another stellar performance off the bench, posting a 12-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included three assists, four steals and a block. 

The Wizards head back home to face the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night, while the Bucks head to the Lone Star State for a Tuesday evening date with the San Antonio Spurs.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Miami Heat, 98-86, at Staples Center on Sunday.

A Clippers blowout appeared to be the likely result with the recent form of these teams and that was just the case in this easy 12-point win. Miami was able to grab two early leads, but the Clippers held a double-digit lead for the final 30 minutes to keep things at ease. The second quarter was the difference in the game, with Los Angeles winning that quarter, 32-20. Defense was key for Los Angeles as well, as they held Miami to 37 percent shooting, while forcing them to commit 15 turnovers. The Clippers, on the other hand, committed just 11 turnovers and recorded 27 assists to the Heat's 14. 

The Heat (11-28) have now lost 13 of their last 15 games. However, one plus is the fact that Hassan Whiteside (eye) returned for this game, as he totaled 15 points and 13 rebounds in 31 minutes of action. Goran Dragic led the team with 24 points, five rebounds and five assists, despite committing five turnovers. Tyler and James Johnson each scored in double figures off the bench, combining for 24 points, 13 rebounds and four assists. Unfortunately for Miami, they play the Golden State Warriors on the road for their next game Friday. 

The Clippers (26-14) have now won four-straight games, as the return of Chris Paul can't be understated. Paul was the player of the game in this win, collecting 19 points, six rebounds, and 18 assists on 7-of-11 shooting. DeAndre Jordan only scored seven points, but snatched down 18 rebounds. J.J. Redick had his best game in weeks, scoring 25 points and grabbing seven rebounds on 9-of-19 from the field. Marreese Speights led the bench, dropping 19 points before fouling out. The Clippers will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday for their next game.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Toronto Raptors, 129-122, at Air Canada Centre on Sunday. 

In a battle between two of the top-five teams in the league, the Rockets were able to add to their hot stretch with a huge road win over Toronto. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the difference in the game, with the Rockets recording 27 assists to 15 turnovers, while the Raptors committed 17 turnovers to just 19 assists. Houston also did damage in the interior, as they outscored Toronto, 66-50, in the paint. This high-scoring game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than 13 points.  

The Rockets (30-9) have now won 19 of their last 21 games, as wins like this show how much they've improved. James Harden recorded a triple-double in the win, accumulating 40 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists, despite committing 10 turnovers. Trevor Ariza was the only other starter in double figures, tallying 17 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Montrezl Harrell was huge off the bench, dropping 28 points on 12-of-13 from the field. Eric Gordon provided 19 points, four rebounds and three assists off the bench as well. The Rockets next game will be on Tuesday against the Charlotte Hornets.

The Raptors (24-13) have now lost four of their last six, as they continue to regress. DeMar DeRozan had another spectacular outing though, leading the team with 36 points, six rebounds and five assists. DeMarre Carroll dropped a season-high 26 points, while adding eight rebounds to his tally. Kyle Lowry went just 2-of-7 from the field to accrue 12 points, five rebounds, six assists and four steals. Toronto will host the Boston Celtics on Tuesday for their next game.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the visiting Utah Jazz, 88-79, at FedEx Forum on Sunday evening. 

This contest lived up to expectation in terms of a low scoring result, as two of the league's best defenses faced off in Memphis. The Grizzlies won the first three quarters and survived a fourth quarter rally from the Jazz, to hang on for their second straight win. With this win, the Grizzlies take a 2-1 lead in the season series and more importantly overtake the Jazz, for fifth place in the Western Conference standings. 

This marks the second straight win for the Grizzlies (24-16) and their 14th home win of the season, as they continue to find a way to get the job done. Mike Conley was the high-point man for Memphis, with 19 points, to go along with nine assists, two rebounds and one steal, in 35 minutes. Only two other players scored in double digits for the Grizz, including Marc Gasol, who finished with 17, and Zach Randolph, who added 13 points and 11 rebounds, in 27 minutes off the bench. The Grizzlies held the Jazz to only 38.9 percent from the field and forced Utah into 18 turnovers. The Grizz go on to face the Thunder in Oklahoma City on Wednesday, which stands as another significant game in terms of the conference standings. 

Meanwhile, the Jazz (23-16) also only had three players score in double digits, as they fell to 11-9 on the road and sixth place in the West. Gordon Hayward was the high-point man for the Jazz, with 22 points, to go along with five rebounds, two assists and two steals, in 34 minutes. Rudy Gobert only tallied three points, but hauled in 13 rebounds, including seven on the offensive end, to go along with three steals, two assists and one block, in 36 minutes. The only other player to score in double digits was Trey Lyles, who added 11 points. The Jazz are 5-5 in their last 10 games and will look to get back on track as they go on to host the Cavaliers on Tuesday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 120-116, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday evening. 

The Cavs (28-8) narrowly escaped Phoenix with the win, as the Suns (12-26) used a strong second half to come within two points, with 3:20 left in the fourth. The Cavs started out with a huge 41-point first quarter but the Suns retaliated in the third, winning the quarter 37-24, to bring the score to 93-90 at the start of the fourth. However, the Cavs were able to hang on to escape with a four-point win.  

Cleveland's big three earned their keep in this one, as they combined for 40 points in the first half, and another 40 in the second half, for a huge 80-point contribution on the night. LeBron James was the high-point man, with 28 points, to go along with eight rebounds and four assists, but gave up a troublesome seven turnovers, in 40 minutes. Kevin Love added 25 points and 10 rebounds, while Kyrie Irving totaled 27 points and seven assists, but also gave up seven turnovers. The Cavs shot 53.7 percent from the field and 15-of-34 from long range, but only tallied 15 assists in the game. They are now 2-0 on their current road trip, which will go on for four more games, beginning with a stop in Utah on Tuesday. 

Eric Bledsoe led the way for the Suns, as he finished with 31 points, eight assists, two rebounds, two steals and one block, while Devin Booker contributed 28 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Four other players scored in double digits in the valiant effort, including Tyson Chandler, who finished with 10 points and 15 rebounds. The Suns shot a solid 52.9 percent from the field and forced the Cavs into 20 turnovers, as they came very close to pulling off the upset. The Suns will look to carry on with similar intensity and fight, as they play host to the Mavericks on Thursday.

												The visiting Detroit Pistons defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in a double-overtime thriller, 125-124, at Moda Center on Sunday. 

Reggie Jackson had multiple attempts to put a much quicker end to Sunday's game, but missed final shots at the end of regulation, as well as the first overtime. However, despite the missed shots, Jackson was still a big reason the Pistons (18-21) were able to pull out the victory, as he scored a team-high 31 points (13-26 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 3-4 FT). Both teams shot extremely well from the floor, as the Pistons finished with a 51.4 percent clip from the field, while the Trail Blazers shot 52 percent. However, the Pistons were able to limit their mistakes, turning the ball over just nine times to the Trail Blazers' 16. 

Along with Jackson's solid offensive performance, both Andre Drummond and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope were key in Sunday's win. Drummond posted his fourth double-double over the last five games, logging 28 points (13-20 FG, 2-3 FT), 14 rebounds, four steals and a pair of blocked shots over 52 minutes. Caldwell-Pope was extremely efficient, going 9-for-14 from the field and 4-for-7 from the three-point line for 26 points. That included the go-ahead three-point bucket in the second overtime, which eventually provided the Pistons with their second consecutive win. The only negative was losing Jon Leuer early in the game with a right knee injury. He played just six minutes before exiting and is slated to undergo additional testing following the game. The Pistons match up with the Kings on Tuesday in Sacramento.

Keeping the Trail Blazers (16-23) alive was the duo of C.J. McCollum and Allen Crabbe. McCollum went off for a game-high 35 points (16-28 FG, 3-9 3Pt), while adding three rebounds, six assists, a steal and a block. Crabbe, who recently logged a few starts with Damian Lillard sidelined, returned to a bench role, but was nearly perfect from the field and chipped in with 30 points (12-15 FG, 5-5 3Pt, 1-1 FT) of his own. McCollum had a shot at the buzzer in the second overtime to secure the victory, but came up short, which leaves the the Trail Blazers at eighth in the Western Conference standings following the loss. The Trail Blazers travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday.

DeMarcus Cousins had the Kings (15-22) up 10 points with just about three minutes remaining in the second quarter before his frustrations got the better of him, leading to a technical foul and an outburst directed at the chair he was sitting on. Cousins did not see further penalty from the refs, but the Warriors (32-6) were able to rally behind their starters and retake the lead midway through the third quarter after Stephen Curry drained a 25-foot three pointer. The Golden State bench was otherwise absent from the contest given the 22 total points contributed from the likes of David West and Andre Iguodala, but the scoring output was not in peril given the 30 and 28 points that Curry and Kevin Durant dropped, respectively. 

Draymond Green rounded out the box score again and finished with nine points, seven rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and two blocks on 4-of-9 shooting, while Klay Thompson added 18 points and six rebounds on 8-of-19 shooting. The Kings got most of their offensive production from their starters as well, led by Rudy Gay's 23 points and Cousins' 17 points and 10 boards. Ty Lawson contributed 15 points across 22 minutes off the bench on 4-of-8 shooting, while doing most of his damage from the free throw line, where he finished 7-of-8 in the contest. 

Both teams play their next game on Tuesday, as the Warriors host the Miami Heat, while the Kings host the Detroit Pistons.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic, 112-95, at Staples Center on Sunday. 

The Lakers (15-26) were at full strength and ran away with a decisive victory in the fourth quarter after D'Angelo Russell and Julius Randle were able to lead the charge on both ends of the floor, while also holding the Magic (16-23) to just 37.8 percent shooting as a unit. Brandon Ingram scored 11 points in the fourth quarter for a second straight game, and also added a big block on the Magic in transition. After a massive 40-point quarter to open the game from Los Angeles, the Lakers were able to shift focus to a defensive-minded set in the second half, which payed off royally after holding the Magic to just nine points in the third quarter. 

Russell finished with 17 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and three steals, while Randle ended with 19 points, nine rebounds, five assists, one steal and one blocked shot. Randle's 19 points tied that of the Magic's Serge Ibaka and Evan Fournier, which was good to lead the scoring department for the contest. Ibaka and Biyombo finished with double-doubles, and combined for 29 points and 21 rebounds, but solving the Magic's shooting woes was more of a challenge for the wings, as their three-point shooting finished at 26.9 percent on 7-of-26 shooting as unit. 

Next up, the Lakers host the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, while the Magic visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks, 123-109, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday.

The Knicks (17-19) were playing on the second game of a back-to-back Saturday, and accordingly, looked sluggish in trying to defend a relentless and balanced attack by the Pacers (19-18). Indiana opened the game with a strong 33-point first quarter, and then proceeded to outscore their visitors by a dominating 29-14 margin in the second. That gave them the cushion they'd need to tally their 14th home victory in 19 games this season. The Pacers saw four of their five starters notch double digits in the scoring column and posted 50.0 and 45.8 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively.

New York was led by a pair of 17-point efforts from Carmelo Anthony and Justin Holiday. Anthony added five assists and two rebounds, while Holiday dished out four assists and brought down three boards. Kristaps Porzingis went for 16 points, four rebounds, three assists, four blocks and a steal. Derrick Rose, who'd endured a tough shooting night against the Bucks on Friday, bounced back with 14 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Courtney Lee chimed in with nine points, while the emerging Mindauguas Kuzminskas supplied 13 points in just 15 minutes off the bench.

Jeff Teague and Paul George set the pace for the Pacers with matching 19-point tallies, with the former complementing his scoring with eight assists, four rebounds and a steal and the latter also providing four assists, three rebounds and three steals. Thaddeus Young registered a near double-double with 16 points, nine rebounds, two assists and four steals, while Myles Turner posted a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included a pair of assists. C.J. Miles (15 points, four rebounds, two steals) and Al Jefferson (14 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal) were highly productive in reserve roles.

The Knicks return home to face off with the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night, and the Pacers are off until a Thursday home date versus the Denver Nuggets.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 117-108, at TD Garden on Saturday.

The Celtics (23-14) learned earlier in the afternoon that they'd play without Avery Bradley, who'd tallied a team-high 26 points on Friday versus the Sixers. Marcus Smart entered the starting five in his stead and didn't disappoint, producing 22 points, six assists, five rebounds, two steals and a block. However, the high-scoring affair was a showcase for two of the game's brightest stars, as Isaiah Thomas (38 points) and Anthony Davis (36 points, 15 rebounds, two assists, two blocks) put on a spectacular show on opposite ends of the court. Ultimately, a 36-point third quarter by Boston did in the Pelicans (14-24), which suffered their 13th road loss in 17 games this season. 

Langston Galloway was actually the second leading scorer on New Orleans in a bench role, posting 20 points, four rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. Jrue Holiday was next with 13 points, five assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block. Rookie Buddy Hield totaled nine points, four rebounds and two assists, with all three of his baskets coming from three-point range. Donatas Motiejunas made his season debut and supplied 11 points, five boards, four assists and a steal over 20 minutes. 

Thomas added three rebounds, two steals and a block to his game-high scoring total, and was also notably 6-of-11 from behind the arc. Al Horford and Jae Crowder had matching eight-point efforts, with the former adding eight assists, seven rebounds and a pair of blocks, and the latter providing six rebounds, two assists and a steal. Gerald Green paced the bench with 15 points and three boards, while Kelly Olynyk offered 12 points, four assists and four rebounds in a reserve role as well. 

The Pelicans continue on their trek through the Northeast with a visit to the New York Knicks on Monday night, while the Celtics tangle with the Toronto Raptors north of the border on Tuesday evening.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Toronto Raptors, 123-118, in overtime at United Center on Saturday.

The Bulls (19-18) survived a difficult second quarter and two last-second game-winning shot attempts by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan at the end of regulation to eventually secure the overtime win. Jimmy Butler spearheaded the victory with a game-high 42 points, which he supplemented with 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals. He also put matters away for good with a 25-foot jumper with 17 seconds remaining in overtime that gave Chicago a 121-116 lead at the time. The Bulls also played some solid defense against one of the best offenses in the league, limiting the Raptors (24-12) to 43.5 percent shooting overall, and a 25.8 percent tally from three-point range.

Toronto was led by DeRozan's 36 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. His scoring haul included a 16-for-17 performance from the foul line. Lowry followed with a 27-point, 12-assist double-double that also included nine rebounds, three steals and a block. Jonas Valanciunas contributed 14 points, seven boards and a pair of blocks, while Cory Joseph led the bench with 14 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

Dwayne Wade checked in second behind Butler with 20 points, seven assists, four rebounds and a block. Taj Gibson (eight points, six rebounds), Robin Lopez (six points, five rebounds) and Michael Carter-Williams (five points, five rebounds, four assists) turned in modest performances, but Doug McDermott checked in with a 17-point, 10-rebound double-double off the bench that also included an assist and a steal, and Nikola Mirotic supplied 12 points, nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block in a reserve role as well.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Denver Nuggets 121-106, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday evening. 

The Thunder snapped a three-game losing streak, as they led for the entirety of the second half, on their way to their 14th home win of the season. 

Russell Westbrook led the way for Oklahoma City (22-16) with his 17th triple-double of the season, this time consisting of 32 points, 17 rebounds and 11 assists. Cameron Payne made his season debut for the Thunder, after missing the first part of the season while recovering from a fractured foot. Payne contributed well in 13 minutes off the bench, as he chipped in eight points on 3-of-4 shooting, including 2-of-3 from long range, along with two rebounds and one assist. Domantas Sabonis started off the game blazing, with nine points in the first quarter but did not score for the remainder of the game. Enes Kanter continued his strong play with 14 points and six rebounds, in 21 minutes off the bench. The Thunder now have a day off before they face off against the Bulls in Chicago on Monday. 

The Nuggets (14-23) kept things competitive in the first half, but could not keep up the pace beyond that, as the game progressively slipped away throughout the second half. Wilson Chandler was the high-point man for Denver, with 24 on 10-of-18 shooting, and added seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks, in 32 minutes off the bench. Five other players scored in double digits for the Nuggets, including Will Barton, who finished with 21 points. Barton started in place of Gary Harris (groin), who was a late scratch. Nikola Jokic also sat this one out, as he was held up by an illness. The Nuggets have now dropped two straight on the road and five straight overall, but have a few days to figure things out before their next contest on Thursday, when they host the Pacers.

												The Utah Jazz rallied back to defeat the host Minnesota Timberwolves 94-92, at Target Center on Saturday evening. 

The Jazz used an 11-0 run late in the fourth quarter to come back and steal one from the Timberwolves. 

Utah (23-15) snapped their short two-game losing streak with an impressive come back win, thanks to a solid team performance. Five players scored in double digits for the Jazz, led by George Hill, who finished with 19 points, along with seven assists and five rebounds, in 33 minutes. This was Hill's first game back after missing three games due to concussion protocol, but he did not look like he missed a beat, as he led the way for the Jazz. Gordon Hayward followed up with 16 points, while Rudy Gobert continued his dominance in the paint, as he finished with 12 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks, in 31 minutes. The Jazz move to 11-8 on the road and will be right back in action on Sunday, as they face the fifth and final game of their current road trip, when they visit Memphis. 

Meanwhile, the Timberwolves (11-26) completely fell apart, as they went scoreless in the final 4:40 of the fourth quarter, leading to their fourth straight loss. All five starters scored in double digits for the T-Wolves, led by Zach LaVine, who finished with 24 points, to go along with nine rebounds, four assists and one steal, in 38 minutes. Karl-Anthony Towns was solid, with 18 points and 15 rebounds, while Andrew Wiggins chipped in 16 points. Minnesota's bench was very quiet, adding only 11 points to the cause. The Timberwolves fall to 6-13 at home and can only look ahead to their next contest, when they play host to the Mavericks on Monday, for a chance to get back on track.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Dallas Mavericks 97-82, at American Airlines Center on Saturday evening. 

The Hawks used a strong second half, where they outscored the Mavericks 52-40, in order to pull away and earn their sixth straight win. 

Tim Hardaway Jr. was the high-point man for Atlanta (21-16), finishing with 22 points on 7-of-13 shooting, in 31 minutes off the bench. Four other players scored in double digits for the Hawks, including Dennis Schroder, who added 20 points, three rebounds, three assists and one steal, in 29 minutes. Dwight Howard had a big game on the glass, as he hauled in 20 rebounds, to go along with 15 points, in 31 minutes. The Hawks shot 40 percent from the field but were efficient from long range, going 11-of-22. The Hawks are now 11-9 on the road, as they move on to the fourth and final game of their current road trip, when they take on the Nets in Brooklyn on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, the Mavericks (11-26) have now dropped two straight and fall to 7-11 at home, as they finished up a three-game home stand with a 1-2 record.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 102-85, at AT&T Center on Saturday. 

With the Spurs in a hot stretch and the Hornets struggling, a double-digit win for San Antonio is far from surprising. They really turned it on in the second half, outscoring Charlotte, 55-35. A 28-8 run spanning between the third and fourth quarters was the decisive stretch, as the Hornets had a 60-58 lead before that huge run. Both offenses struggled, with each team hitting just 40 percent of their shots. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the difference in the game, with San Antonio recording 29 assists to just seven turnovers, while Charlotte committed 15 turnovers to 18 assists. 

The Hornets (20-18) had to play this game without Nicolas Batum and that was simply too much to overcome against an elite team like the Spurs. Kemba Walker led the team in scoring, as he tallied 18 points, two rebounds and three assists. Jeremy Lamb got the start for Batum and finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went 6-of-9 from the field to accrue 12 points, nine rebounds and two steals. On deck for the Hornets is a road matchup against the Houston Rockets on Tuesday. 

The Spurs (30-7) have now won 12 of their last 14 games, as they continue to thrive at home. Davis Bertans led San Antonio in scoring, as he dropped a career-high 21 points on 5-of-6 shooting off the bench. LaMarcus Aldridge recorded a double-double, totaling 15 points and 11 rebounds. Kawhi Leonard led the starters, scoring 19 points and adding two rebounds and three assists to his tally. Dewayne Dedmon came off the bench to contribute 15 points and 10 rebounds on 6-of-6 from the field. San Antonio will look to keep rolling at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 112-105, at Verizon Center on Friday.

The Wizards (17-18) came in to the contest with a superb 13-6 home mark, while the Timberwolves (11-25) had only mustered five wins in 17 tries on the road. This alone gave Washington a built-in edge going in, but Andrew Wiggins did his best to try and buck the odds Friday. The standout forward scored a game-high 41 points, which he supplemented with two assists, two steals and a rebound. However, the hosts countered with a balanced attack, as all five members of the first unit scored in double digits. Those efforts led to a stellar 58.2 percent success rate from the field, and a 54.5 percent mark from three-point range. A 32-20 edge in the fourth quarter propelled the Wizards to victory, after they'd entered the period facing an 85-82 deficit.

Karl-Anthony Towns was a distant second on the Timberwolves with an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included five assists, a steal and a block. Gorgui Dieng also accomplished the feat, posting 15 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Zach LaVine endured a difficult shooting night as his 3-for-14 tally led to an eight-point effort. He also hauled in five boards and dished out three assists. Brandon Rush paced the bench with 10 points.

Bradley Beal led the way for the Wizards with 22 points, three assists and two rebounds. Marcin Gortat turned in a customary stat line of 19 points, 10 boards, an assist and three blocks. John Wall turned in a 18-point, 18-assist double-double that also included two rebounds and two steals. Otto Porter supplied 17 points, six boards, two assists, two blocks and a steal. Markieff Morris rounded out matters for the starting five with 15 points, six rebounds and an assist. Jason Smith had a productive night off the bench, totaling 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and a pair of blocks, one of those a highlight-worthy stuff of Karl-Anthony Towns. 

The Timberwolves head back home for a Saturday night showdown with the Utah Jazz, while the Wizards visit the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday afternoon.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Orlando Magic, 100-93, at Amway Center on Friday. 

Houston won despite going 7-of-12 from the charity stripe and 15-of-49 from long distance thanks to its defense. The Rockets held Orlando to just 42 percent from the field, 69 percent from the free-throw line and 35 percent from three-point range. The Rockets really turned it on in the second half, as they outscored the Magic, 56-41 in that 24-minute stretch. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive, with Houston recording eight more assists and the same amount of turnovers as the Magic. 

The Rockets (29-9) have now won 18 of their last 20 games, despite this being one of their worst offensive games of the season. Ryan Anderson led the Rockets in scoring, as he scored 17 of his 18 points in the third quarter. James Harden went 0-of-8 from three-point range, but still accumulated 14 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists. Patrick Beverley tallied 17 points, nine rebounds, three assists and three steals on 7-of-9 shooting. Eric Gordon was the lone bench player in double figures, as he accrued 17 points, three rebounds and four assists, despite going 3-of-16 from long range.  

The Magic (16-22) have struggled on offense all season and shooting nights like this have become all too common. D.J. Augustin led the team in scoring, as he dropped 19 points off the bench, with 16 of those coming in the second quarter. Aaron Gordon was the teams best player, as he collected 18 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Serge Ibaka recorded a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double in the defeat.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 110-106, at TD Garden on Friday. 

Facing a Sixers (9-25) squad that had only tallied three road wins in 13 tries coming in, it may have been hard to blame the Celtics (22-14) if they were guilty of a little overconfidence Friday. A 39-point second period by Philadelphia was therefore likely a rather sobering wake-up call, as was the 62-51 halftime deficit Boston found itself in. The Celtics were mostly a different team in the second half, as they outscored their visitors by a 59-44 margin over the final 24 minutes. However, the game wasn't truly decided until the closing seconds, with Al Horford's go-ahead three-pointer with 17.2 remaining and two key free throws by Isaiah Thomas with two seconds on the clock finally sealing the hard-fought home win.

Philadelphia was led by Joel Embiid's 23 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks. However, he battled foul trouble in the second half, and ultimately was charged with his sixth infraction with six seconds remaining. Ersan Ilyasova went for 20 points, three assists, two rebounds, two steals and two blocks, but missed a couple of key three-point attempts late with the Sixers trailing. T.J. McConnell was outstanding setting up his teammates for scoring opportunities, compiling 17 assists and supplementing them with nine points, four boards and a pair of steals. Robert Covington produced nine points, while Gerald Henderson led the second unit with 18 points, four rebounds, an assist and a block. Nerlens Noel was productive in a reserve role as well, registering 13 points, eight rebounds, two assists, three blocks and two steals. 

Avery Bradley was the high scorer for the Celtics on the night, totaling 26 points, and adding nine rebounds, two assists and a steal. Backcourt mate Thomas stepped up with 24 points, four rebounds and three assists, but did commit a game-high seven turnovers. Horford amassed 19 points, 12 rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Amir Johnson posted 13 points, five rebounds, three assists, four blocks and a steal. Jae Crowder notably went scoreless over 30 minutes, but did have three assists, two rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Marcus Smart paced the second unit with 14 points, eight assists, two rebounds, two blocks and a steal. 

The Sixers head to Brooklyn to face the Nets on Sunday, while the Celtics remain home to host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday evening.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 116-108, at Barclay's Center on Friday. 

Cleveland was expected to win this game rather easily and they took care of business, thanks to full health. In fact, the Cavaliers led for the final 30 minutes, leading by 24 at times in their easy win. Despite shooting worse from the free-throw line, the aggressiveness of Cleveland to get there was the difference, as they attempted 43 free-throws to the Nets 19. The turnovers were decisive as well, with the Cavaliers winning that battle, 19-12. Much of that is attributed to the fact that Cleveland recorded 14 steals in the win. 

The Cavaliers (27-8) didn't close out quite like they'd expect, but they got the result they wanted. LeBron James carried the load, as he tallied 36 points, nine rebounds and six assists on 14-of-20 from the field. Kyrie Irving wasn't far behind, as he scored 32 of his own, while handing out four assists. Kevin Love recorded a double-double, totaling 17 points and 13 rebounds. Tristan Thompson was the only other Cavs player in double figures, accumulating 10 points, nine rebounds, three steals and two blocks. On deck for the Cavaliers is a road matchup with the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.  

The Nets (8-27) did a nice job of sticking around in this game, but they simply didn't have enough to hang around with a team like the Cavaliers. Bojan Bogdanovic was easily the teams best player, as he accrued 23 points and four assists. Trevor Booker recorded a 13-point, 12-rebound, four-assist double-double in the defeat. Brook Lopez did score 17 points, but he committed five turnovers and added just one rebound, one assist and no defensive statistics to his tally. Caris LeVert led the bench with 19 points, four rebounds and five assists. Brooklyn have a winnable game in their next fixture, as they host the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.

												The New York Knicks snapped a six-game losing streak as they defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks 116-111, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening. 

The Knicks (17-19) used a monstrous fourth quarter, including an 8-0 run in final two minutes in order to take a five-point lead and earn their revenge against the Bucks (18-17), who had defeated them in the first game of this home-and-home series, in new York earlier this week.

Jeff Hornacek decided to go with his gut and roll with rookie point guard Ron Baker in the fourth quarter, while leaving Derrick Rose and Brandon Jennings on the bench. Baker finished with four assists and zero turnovers, as he helped fuel a 33-15 fourth quarter that saw the Knicks take their first lead since they led 34-33 early in the second quarter. Carmelo Anthony went cold near the end of the game, missing 6-of-7 shots but totally made up for it as he hit a three to give the Knicks the 112-111 lead with 51 seconds left. Joakim Noah and Kristaps Porzingis both fouled out in the final few minutes but Kyle O'Quinn and Lance Thomas came in to pick up right where the big men left off. Melo was the high-point man for New York, with 26 points to go along with 10 assists and six rebounds, while Porzingis followed up with 24 points, six rebounds and three blocks. The Knicks will be right back in action on Saturday, as they head to Indiana to take on the Pacers. 

Meanwhile, the Bucks saw their three-game win streak come to an end despite, a combined 50 points from Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Giannis added five blocks, six rebounds, two assists and two steals, while Parker added five assists and four steals. Greg Monroe was solid in 28 minutes off the bench, as he poured in 19 points, along with seven rebounds and four assists, in his fourth consecutive game scoring in double digits. The Bucks shot 50 percent from the field, including 54.5 percent from long range but were not able to hang on for the full 48, as the Knicks surged back to get their revenge.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers demolished the Miami Heat on Friday, 127-100.

The Lakers (14-26) are finally operating at full health after suffering injuries to key players throughout the month of December.  The team saw dominance on both ends of the floor on Friday, starting with the glass.  Los Angeles held a 62-41 rebounding advantage, recording 18 offensive boards on the night.  On the offensive end, the team shot a strong 50 percent from the field and drained 10 three-pointers.   Veteran forward Luol Deng scored 19 points and had a team-high 14 rebounds.  Sixth man Lou Williams, meanwhile, led the team with 24 points off the bench.

The Heat (11-27), on the other hand, were shorthanded on Friday, missing star center Hassan Whiteside.  Big man Willie Reed once again stepped up in a starting role, tying a career high with 22 points and pulling down 12 rebounds.  However, the team saw struggles on the offensive end, hitting just 41 percent of its shots with only eight threes. Forward James Johnson provided some spark off the bench, though, scoring 20 on 7-of-11 from the field.  

The Heat will face the Clippers on Sunday, while the Lakers will host the Magic.

												The Memphis Grizzlies snapped a two-game losing streak, as they defeated the host Golden State Warriors 128-119 in overtime, at Oracle Arena on Friday night.

The Grizzlies (23-16) trailed 98-79 at the beginning of the quarter, but fought their way back to tie it up at 111, as Mike Conley hit a super-clutch jumper over Draymond Green, with seven seconds remaining. It was the first tie since the first quarter when it was 6-6, while the Grizzlies had never led in the game until they went up 113-111 with their first possession in overtime; from which they did not look back, as they led for the rest of the overtime period. This marks the second time this season that the Grizzlies have defeated the Warriors (31-6). 

Mike Conley came up huge for Memphis as he finished with 27 points, including the tying bucket at the end of the fourth and some big points in overtime. He added 12 assists, four rebounds and one steal, as he led the way in the impressive comeback win. Zach Randolph also poured in 27 points, and added 11 rebounds and six assists, in 35 minutes off the bench. Marc Gasol added 23 points, while Tony Allen finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds, six steals and three assists. Allen was a huge part of the victory as he came up with some incredible defensive and hustle plays in the clutch. The Grizzlies will look to build off this amazing feat, as they go on to host the Jazz on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, a 40-point night from Stephen Curry was made obsolete by the Grizzlies relentless comeback. Kevin Durant poured in 27 points, to go along with 13 rebounds, four assists and three blocks, while Klay Thompson added 17 points, six rebounds and two assists. The Warriors went ice cold in the fourth quarter, where they only went 2-of-13 from the field, with the only two field goals coming from Curry. The Warriors bench was quiet, contributing only, 14 points in the loss. The Warriors will look to bounce back as they head to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Sunday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Sacramento Kings on Friday, 106-98.

Los Angeles (25-14) enjoyed the return of superstar point guard Chris Paul, who had missed the previous week of action with a hamstring injury.  Paul immediately got back to his pass-first play style, dishing out a team-high 12 assists to go with 14 points and three steals.  DeAndre Jordan, who narrowly edged out Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins last season for All-NBA First Team center, had an impressive performance of his own, scoring 20 points on 9-of-10 shooting and grabbing nine rebounds.  As a team, the Clippers saw relatively potent offense, shooting over 46 percent and hitting 13 three-pointers.  

Sacramento (15-21), meanwhile, is vying for the eighth seed in the Western Conference, hoping for its first playoff berth since 2006.  The Kings came out strong on Friday, hopping out to a double-digit lead in the first quarter, but saw an intense collapse in the second.  LA was able to go on a whopping 34-12 run in the second quarter, establishing a lead that eventually led them to victory.  The collapse was largely due to the horrid play of the Kings' bench, as the second unit shot just 6-of-20 for 14 points.  Sacramento's starters, on the other hand, saw solid performances.  Star center DeMarcus Cousins led the team with 25 points and 11 rebounds to go with seven assists, three steals, and two blocks.  

Los Angeles will host the Heat on Sunday, while Sacramento will host the Warriors.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 121-109, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Thursday. 

Indiana came into this game as a sizable favorite and they didn't disappoint. The Nets had just two leads in this game that lasted less than a minute and the final one at the end of the second quarter was followed up by a 33-11 run by the Pacers to open things up. The Pacers offense was hot all night, as they shot 52 percent from the field and 46 percent from three-point range. They were extremely efficient as well, with the Nets forcing just six turnovers, while committing 13 on their end. Indiana dominated in the paint too, winning that battle, 52-30.

The Nets (8-26) continue to falter on the defensive end, as this 121-point let up adds to their long list of defensive lapses. Trevor Booker continued his good form, as he led the starters with 16 points and six rebounds in just 19 minutes of action. Brook Lopez was the only other starter with more than 10 points, accruing 12 points, six rebounds and three assists. Sean Kilpatrick was demoted to the bench, but collected 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in a motivated performance. Justin Hamilton also played great off the bench, amassing 16 points and eight rebounds. Thing's don't get any easier for Brooklyn, as they play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday for their next game. 

The Pacers (19-18) have now added to a season-long four-game winning streak, as they finally appear to be living up to lofty expectations. Jeff Teague was the player of the game, as he accumulated 21 points, seven rebounds and 15 assists in the win. Paul George led the team in scoring, with 26 points, three assists and three steals. Myles Turner totaled 25 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks on 9-of-15 shooting in one of his best games of the year. Indiana will look to get to five-straight wins on Saturday against the New York Knicks.

												The Toronto Raptors rallied back to defeat the visiting Utah Jazz 101-93, at Air Canada Center on Thursday evening. 

The Jazz started out strong, with a 27-18 first quarter, but were outscored in each of the remaining quarters, resulting in their second straight loss. Kyle Lowry scored 16 points in the fourth quarter alone, to fuel the final run that the Raptors needed to pull off an impressive home win.

This was the first game back home after a six-game road trip for the Raptors (24-11). Despite shooting only 39.6 percent from the field, the Raptors scratched and clawed, with 10 steals, 27 points off turnovers and 12 fast break points, to pull off what seemed like an unlikely win. Kyle Lowry was the high-point man, with 33, along with six rebounds, five assists and three steals, in 41 minutes. DeMar DeRozan followed up with 23 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block, in 37 minutes. Jonas Valanciunas had his best game in a while, as he tallied 18 points and 13 rebounds, in 31 minutes. The Raptors improve to 12-5 at home, but will have to turn right around and head back out on the road, as they play Saturday evening in Chicago. 

This marks the second straight loss for the Jazz (22-15), as they are now 1-2 on their current five-game road trip. They played a solid game and even led 75-71 at the beginning of the fourth. However, they were not able to keep up with Toronto's hustle in the final quarter, where they were outscored by 10. Only three players scored in double digits for the Jazz, led by Shelvin Mack, with 17. Rudy Gobert totaled 15 points and 16 rebounds, while Gordon Hayward added 16 points. The Jazz shot 46 percent from the field and 35 percent from long range, but were outscored at the free throw line and in the paint. The Jazz are now 10-8 on the road and have dropped two straight, while they move on to face the Timberwolves in Minnesota on Saturday.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Charlotte Hornets 115-114 Thursday at the Palace in Auburn Hills. 

The game ended up being a lot closer than one would have thought as the final period kicked off, as the the Pistons (17-21) opened up a lead as large as 19 points before Kemba Walker and the Hornets (20-17) decided to come storming back. After tying the game late, Charlotte ultimately found themselves down one with 0.5 seconds remaining on the game clock. Marco Belinelli, without a teammate open, threw a pass off a defender's back and drained a jumper off the glass, but it ended up leaving his hands long after the buzzer had sounded. 

In their victory, the Pistons got a pair of nearly perfect performances off the bench Thursday night, with Tobias Harris continuing his hot streak off the bench, and Boban Marjanovic putting together his best performance of the season. Harris finished with a team-high 25 points on 10-of-16 shooting, while Marjanovic, recorded a double-double of 15 points and 18 rebounds in just 22 minutes. For the starters, Marcus Morris posted a double-double of his own of 20 points and 10 rebounds, while Reggie Jackson, on top of hitting some crucial free throws in crunch time, recorded 22 points and 11 assists. Detroit managed to move the ball efficiently and effectively, posting 24 assists to just seven turnovers as a team. 

For the Hornets, it was a very cold start with a very hot finish, as Walker carried the team on his back after struggling through the first three quarters. Walker shot 9-of-11 from the field in the fourth quarter en route to scoring 20 of his 32 points in the final period. He also finished with seven rebounds and five assists on top of that, but the team's subpar performance through the first three quarters ultimately led to a deficit that was too big to overcome.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 99-94 Thursday at Smoothie King Center. 

The Hawks' (20-16) victory was supplemented with the news that Kyle Korver was going to be traded to the Cavaliers, and the sharp-shooting wing didn't play as a result. But it didn't phase Atlanta on the road, as they managed to record their fifth straight win after hitting a cold spell in December. Dennis Schroder led the way for Atlanta with a solid all-around performance of 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes.  Meanwhile, the Hawks' starting frontcourt of Paul Millsap and Dwight Howard each recorded double-doubles, with Millsap posting 17 points and 10 rebounds and Howard netting 12 points and grabbing 11 boards, as the two worked to slow the one-man wrecking crew that is Anthony Davis. 

Davis finished with 20 points on just 7-of-20 shooting from the field for the Pelicans (14-23), but he did manage to grab a game-high 19 rebounds. Jrue Holiday posted 18 points of his own Thursday but was also very inefficient shooting from the field, going just 5-of-13. His poor shooting effort was only outdone by his running mate in the backcourt, Buddy Hield, who hit just five of his 16 shot attempts. As a team, the poor shooting was contagious, as the team shot just 36.6 percent from the field. 

Up next, the Hawks will look to extend their win streak to six against the Mavericks in Dallas on Saturday, while Pelicans will head to Boston on Saturday to take on the Celtics.

												Two of the league's better teams squared off on Thursday as the Houston Rockets took down the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder, 118-116.  Former teammates and MVP hopefuls James Harden and Russell Westbrook showed down in a battle of the league's top talent.

Houston (28-9) has been one of the league's hottest teams after a mediocre start.  The Rockets won 15 games in the month of December and have seen strong leadership from superstar combo guard James Harden.  Harden led the team in both scoring and assists on Thursday, pouring in 26 points to go with 12 assists and eight rebounds.  The team saw a strong 27 assists and turned it over just nine times on the night.  The Rockets also shot an excellent 48 percent from the field and hit 15 three-pointers.  Sixth man Eric Gordon, the league's leading three-point shooter, had five threes.  

OKC (21-16) dropped the game despite seeing 49 points from Russell Westbrook.  Westbrook shot 16-of-34 and had eight three-pointers while playing an integral part in the Thunder's 33-21 fourth quarter that allowed them to remain in the game.  The team crashed the boards with tenacity, recording 54 rebounds on the night to Houston's 43.  However, the Thunder shot a slightly lower 45 percent and had only 12 shots from beyond the arc.  

The Rockets will visit Orlando on Friday while OKC will host the Nuggets on Saturday.

												The visiting Phoenix Suns beat the host Dallas Mavericks, 102-95, on Thursday.

Phoenix (12-25) has now won two straight after an awful stretch towards the end of December.  On Thursday, point guard Eric Bledsoe led the way with 26 points, while sophomore guard Devin Booker added 22 of his own.  While guard play was key for Phoenix's offense, the team was able to pull away on the backs of strong rebounding.  Veteran center Tyson Chandler pulled down 18 boards, contributing to a 53-31 Phoenix advantage in the rebounding column.  The Suns shot almost 45 percent on the night and only made seven three-pointers.

Dallas (11-25) has begun to turn things around after an abysmal start to the season, but Thursday's loss was not promising.  Forward Harrison Barnes continued to be a reliable scoring option for the Mavericks, as he poured in 19 points.  Point guard Deron Williams, meanwhile, scored 20 with six assists.  However, the team could not keep up on the glass and only hit nine three-pointers, making it difficult to keep up with Phoenix. 

Dallas will host the Hawks on Saturday, while the Suns will host Cleveland on Sunday.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the host Denver Nuggets, 127-99, at Pepsi Center on Thursday.

The Spurs were expected to win this game according to recent results and they left very little doubt who the better team is. The second and third quarters is when they took control, as San Antonio outscored Denver, 61-44 in that 24-minute stretch. Shooting was the clear difference, with the Spurs shooting 56 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range, while the Nuggets hit just 45 percent from the field and 28 percent from three-point range. San Antonio also dominated the assist-to-turnover ratio, recording nine more assists than Denver, while committing six less turnovers.

The Spurs (29-7) had a tough task in altitude here, but they made it look easy in a blowout win. LaMarcus Aldridge led San Antonio in scoring, as he dropped 28 points on 11-of-18 from the field. Kawhi Leonard was second on the team, collecting 24 points, six rebounds and five assists. Tony Parker tallied 21 points, three rebounds and nine assists on 10-of-11 shooting. Pau Gasol totaled 17 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Manu Ginobili came off the bench to provide 11 points, three rebounds and three assists. On deck for the Spurs is a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday. 

The Nuggets (14-22) were recently called out for their poor defense and a 127-point outing allowed here won't quiet those notions. Nikola Jokic was easily Denver's best player, as he led the team with 19 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. Danilo Gallinari went just 5-of-13 from the field, but finished second on the team with 15 points. Wilson Chandler led the bench in scoring, amassing 11 points and seven rebounds. The Nuggets will look to get out of this slide on Saturday against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 118-109 at Moda Center on Thursday. 

The Trail Blazers (16-22) improved to 10-7 on their home court and saw a strong game from Damian Lillard, who returned to the lineup after a few missed games due to an ankle injury. LIllard's back court teammate, C.J. McCollum, was pullling the weight on the scoring front in Lillard's absence, and continued to pour in points with the back court now at full strength. The Blazers responded stronger in the second half, taking advantage of the Lakers pour ability to close out games, and scored 30-plus points as a unit in each of the third and fourth quarters. McCollum's driving six foot jumper with just over four minutes remaining in the game put the Blazers up by one point, and the hot shooting McCollum dropped in a long distance three to add to the lead. Portland did not have to look back after that, doing the finishing touches from the free throw line. 

The Lakers best performer was D'Angelo Russell, who finished the game with 22 points, four rebounds and two assists on 6-of-18 shooting. Nick Young managed three buckets from behind the arc, but finished just 3-of-9 for the game and scored 13 points. Julius Randle rounded out the box score again, as he went for 17 points, nine rebounds, five assists and one steal. Brandon Ingram drew the start at small forward and finished with 11 points on 3-of-6 shooting. 

Next up, the Lakers play the second game of a back-to-back when they host the Miami Heat, while the Blazers visit the Detroit Pistons on Saturday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 123-112, at Spectrum Center on Wednesday.

The Hornets (20-16) came in to Wednesday looking to cut a short two-game losing streak off at the pass, but faced the high hurdle known as Russell Westbrook in their attempt to do so. However, the dynamic duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum stepped up as they have so many times already this season, combining for 48 points to help offset a 33-point, 15-rebound, eight-assist effort from Westbrook that also included two steals and a block. The Hornets were also able to outperform the Thunder (21-14) shooting-wise, with their respective 46.3 and 37.5 percent tallies from the field and three-point range outpacing the corresponding 43.8 and 30.0 percent figures from the visitors on those categories. Charlotte was at its best in the fourth quarter, which they entered with a slight 88-87 deficit, outscoring OKC by a 36-24 margin over the final 12 minutes. 

Victor Oladipo and Steven Adams were next behind Westbrook with matching 18-point efforts, with the former supplementing his scoring with five assists, three rebounds and a steal, and the latter also providing 12 boards, three assists, a steal and a block. Andre Roberson and Domantas Sabonis only contributed two points apiece, but Enes Kanter made up for some of the scoring void from the bench, registering 22 points and eight rebounds in just 20 minutes.

Batum led the Hornets with 28 points, four assists, three rebounds and a block. Walker had a near double-double with 20 points, nine assists, four rebounds and two steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist posted a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included a block. Marvin Williams provided a solid stat line of eight points, eight rebounds, an assist and three blocks. Frank Kaminsky III totaled 17 points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block while leading the bench, while Ramon Sessions and Jeremy Lamb stepped up with a pair of nine efforts in reserve roles as well. With Cody Zeller out with a concussion and Roy Hibbert largely ineffective as a starter, even Spencer Hawes got into the act Wednesday, compiling eight points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks in 24 minutes off the bench. 

The Thunder next visit the Houston Rockets on Thursday night, while the Hornets head to Motown to face off with the Detroit Pistons on Thursday evening as well.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Orlando Magic, 111-92, at Amway Center on Wednesday.

In a battle between two teams battling for a playoff spot, the more experienced team went on a late run to cap off a big road win. In fact, the Hawks finished the game on a 23-8 run to open things up and win comfortably. They actually led for the majority of the game, as Orlando's only lead lasted less than two minutes in the second quarter. Shooting was the big difference in the game, with Atlanta hitting 54 percent from the field and 53 percent from three-point range, while Orlando went 43 percent from the field and 32 percent from three-point range on their end. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, as the Hawks recorded more assists than the Magic, while committing less turnovers. 

The Hawks (19-16) are starting to rebound after a terrible December and dominant road wins like this show just how good they can be. Dennis Schroeder ran the offense at ease, accumulating 18 points, six rebounds and seven assists in the win. Dwight Howard recorded a double-double, totaling 13 points and 12 rebounds. Paul Millsap tallied 16 points, six rebounds, four assists and four steals. Kent Bazmore was second in scoring, dropping 17 points and handing out four assists. The Hawks will play again on Thursday in a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans. 

The Magic (16-21) have been plying better with their recent lineup change, but that wasn't the case here. Elfrid Payton was moved back to the starting-five for this game and led the team with 15 points, four rebounds, six assists and three steals. Aaron Gordon tied the team lead in scoring, amassing 15 points and 10 rebounds. No other starter scored in double figures, as Serge Ibaka was ejected with nine points and 11 rebounds in the final minute. Nikola Vucevic came off the bench to provide 10 points, six rebounds and six assists. Evan Fournier returned from a five-game absence to contribute 14 points off the bench. Orlando will host the Houston Rockets on Friday for their next game.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks, 105-104, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. 

The Knicks (16-19) checked in to Wednesday's contest looking to snap a five-game losing streak and heading into the fourth quarter, they looked like they were well on their way to that goal. New York led the Bucks (18-16) by a comfortable 87-73 margin, but a surging Milwaukee squad wasn't done by any stretch. They ultimately outscored their hosts by a 32-17 spread in the final 12 minutes, capping off a momentous comeback with a 15-foot bucket from Giannis Antetokounmpo as time expired to seal the somewhat improbable road win. 

Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 27 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, a steal and three blocks, his second consecutive double-double. Greg Monroe actually checked in as the second-leading scorer and did so in his customary bench role, posting 18 points, along with nine boards, four assists, three steals and a block. Jabari Parker contributed 15 points, four rebounds, three assists and a steal. Malcolm Brogdon went for 12 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Mirza Teletovic was productive in a reserve role as well, generating 13 points and a rebound.

Carmelo Anthony totaled a game-high 30 points to lead the Knicks, a total he supplemented with 11 rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Derrick Rose was a distant second with 15 points, four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Courtney Lee checked in with 11 points, three assists, two rebounds, a steal and a block. Joakim Noah mustered a modest eight points but did haul in 16 boards, while Mindaugas Kuzminskas paced the second unit with 15 points, four rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 106-94, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday.

This marks Cleveland's third home loss of the season, as they didn't have enough in the arsenal to pull out a win. They really struggled late, as they made just one shot over the final six-plus minutes. Defense carried Chicago all night long, as they held Cleveland to 41 percent from the field and 32 percent from three-point range. The assist-to-turnover ratio was decisive as well, with the Bulls recording 10 more assists than the Cavaliers, while committing two less turnovers. 

The Bulls (18-18) have been playing terribly recently, but a road win against the Cavaliers is just what they need to get going. Jimmy Butler struggled through the first three quarters, but finished the game with 20 points, six rebounds and eight assists, with 14 of those points coming in the fourth quarter. Taj Gibson went 9-of-10 from the field to collect 18 points and seven rebounds. Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to combine for 33 points and 10 rebounds. Chicago will host the Toronto Bulls for their next game on Saturday. 

The Cavaliers (26-8) had to play this game without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, as they simply didn't have enough in the tank to beat a hungry Bulls team. LeBron James had to carry the load, as he led the team with 31 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Jordan McRae got the start for Irving and accrued 21 points, three rebounds, two assists and two blocks in the loss. Channing Frye was the only other starter with more than two points, as he amassed 15 points and five rebounds. Cleveland should fair better in their next game, as they take on the struggling Brooklyn Nets on Friday.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers took down the visiting Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday, 115-106.

Los Angeles (24-14) has been devastated by injuries midway through the season.  Stars Chris Paul (hamstring) and Blake Griffin (knee surgery) both sat on Wednesday, leaving LA shorthanded and reliant on its backups.  Fortunately for the Clippers, the bench pulled through, as point guard Austin Rivers had 28 points and seven assists.  Raymond Felton also played 37 minutes and had 11 points, six assists, and four steals.  The true star of the show, however, was All-NBA center and well-known ironman DeAndre Jordan.  Jordan had 18 points to go with a whopping 20 rebounds and two blocks.  As a team, the Clippers shot a solid 50 percent from the floor and poured in nine three-pointers.

The Grizzlies (22-16) have now dropped two games in two days on their road trip to Los Angeles, as the team lost by double-digits to the Lakers on Tuesday.  Memphis had ailments of its own, as the oft-injured Chandler Parsons missed yet another contest on Wednesday.  Marc Gasol had a strong night, scoring 23 points, and Mike Conley had a 17-point, 12-assist double-double.  While the team saw strong play from its stars, it shot just 43 percent from the field and 76 percent at the free-throw line.  

The Grizzlies will visit the Warriors on Friday, while the Clippers will take on the Kings.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 125-117 at Oracle Arena on Wednesday. 

The Warriors (31-5) made it four in a row on their home court in a tilt that was fairly one sided before tip-off, given Damian Lillard (ankle) was sidelined. Lillard's backcourt teammate, C.J. McCollum picked up the weight and led the Trail Blazers (15-22) with a sharp shooting first half to the tune of 26 points, six rebounds, three assists and two blocks. McCollum went on to finish with 35 points, however, when Klay Thompson was made the focal point on defense, the matchup did not go in the Blazers shooting guards favor. The Warriors put the game away late in the fourth quarter after Kevin Durant drove the lane and received an and-1 to put Golden State up 13 points with 2:05 remaining in the game. 

Stephen Curry matched McCollum's 35 points and went 5-of-13 from behind the arc. Kevin Durant also went for 30 points, while Draymond Green put up big box score numbers after he finished with nine points, 11 assists, seven rebounds, three steals and one blocked shot. All five Blazers starters finished in double figures scoring. Allen Crabbe contributed 18 points, while Mason Plumlee added 16 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three steals across 33 minutes. 

Next up, the Blazers play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, while the Warriors host the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Sacramento Kings, 107-102, despite a remarkable comeback by the Kings at Golden 1 Center on Wednesday. 

The first half was a one sided affair after the Heat (11-26) led for practically every minute from tip-off to the second quarter buzzer, but an emphatic third quarter rally on behalf of the Kings (15-20) made for an exciting second half. The Kings were down as much as 19 points with 2:11 left in the third quarter after James Johnson drained two free throws, but Sacramento responded with 13 straight points to close out the quarter and trailed by only six points heading into the final period. DeMarcus Cousins made a three foot layup to put the Kings up by two points with 7:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, but that was the last lead the Kings had in the game. Cousins went back to the line later in the period to tie the game at 102 points a piece, however, Tyler Johnson's and-1 sealed the deal with under :20 left and the Heat came away with a wild road victory. 

Both teams were led by their bench after a dreadful showing on behalf of most of the starters from each squad. Anthony Tolliver provided 14 points, three boards and two assists in 29 minutes for the Kings, while his bench counterparts Aaron Afflalo, Garrett Temple and Ty Lawson each provided 15 points. Cousins rounded out the box score, but not in the precise fashion that he has been providing all season long. The Sacramento all-star center posted 13 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals on 4-of-15 shooting across 32 minutes. 

As for the Heat, the story is the same. Tyler Johnson lit up the bench with 23 points, which led all scorers in the game, to go along with six rebounds, two assists, one steal and two blocks on 7-of-11 shooting. Goran Dragic led the starters with 19 points and seven assists, while the Heat, as a unit, shot 48.6 percent from the field en route to the road win. 

Both teams play Los Angeles based teams on Friday, as the Heat visit Staples Center to take on the Lakers, while the Kings host the Clippers at Golden 1 Center.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 93-91, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday.

The battle of two teams with unsightly records and questionable defenses turned out to surprisingly be a low-scoring affair, and saw the Sixers (9-24) jump out to an impressive 29-16 lead after one quarter. However the Timberwolves (11-24) battled back during the middle portion of the game, outscoring their hosts by a 52-50 margin over the second and third periods. They made a final push in the fourth, which culminated in the forging of a 91-91 tie with one second remaining after a Ricky Rubio 25-foot three-point jumper. However, it was not to be for Minnesota on Tuesday, as Robert Covington two-point basket off a Dario Saric assist on the ensuing possession sealed the win for Philadelphia at the buzzer.

The Timberwolves were led by Zach LaVine, who went for 28 points, three rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block. Karl-Anthony Towns produced a 23-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included five assists and two blocks. Gorgui Dieng was effective down low as well, posting 10 points, nine boards, two assists, a steal and two blocks. Andrew Wiggins endured a nightmarish shooting performance, going just 2-of-15 from the field, which helped lead an eight-point performance. Rubio produced five points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals, with one of his two made baskets from the floor being the aforementioned clutch three-pointer. Shabazz Muhammad led the bench with 10 points, five rebounds and a steal.

The Sixers were paced by Joel Embiid's 25 points, which he complemented with eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal. Ersan Ilyasova supplied 19 points, five boards, an assist and a block. Covington generated a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double that also featured two assists, four steals and a block. Nerlens Noel and Saric led the second unit with a pair of eight-point tallies, with the latter also contributing seven boards and the game-winning assist.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Utah Jazz, 115-104, at TD Center on Tuesday.

The Celtics (21-14) came in to the game refreshed, having last played when the calendar still read 2016. Isaiah Thomas, who'd posted a career-high 52 points in that Dec. 30 victory, decided that he wanted to get the new year off on a momentous note as well. This time his remarkable accomplishment came in the assist category, as the point guard dished out a career-best 15 dimes, and scored 29 points, hauled in four rebounds and recorded a steal. His standout effort helped Boston overcome a slim 29-28 deficit after one quarter and outscore the Jazz (22-14) by an 87-75 margin the rest of the way. 

Utah was led by Gordon Hayward's 23 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds, two assists and a steal. Derrick Favors saw 29 minutes, his highest allotment since returning from a lengthy absence due to knee trouble, and produced 12 points, seven assists and six boards. Rodney Hood supplied nine points, four assists and three rebounds. Rudy Gobert could only tally eight points but did haul in 13 rebounds and record a block. A pair of wily veterans led the bench, as Joe Johnson generated 17 points, three rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal, while Boris Diaw went for 15 points in just 15 minutes.

Al Horford and Jae Crowder checked in behind Thomas with matching 21-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, four assists and a steal, and the latter posting three boards, an assist and a steal. Avery Bradley returned from a recent illness to compile 14 points, three rebounds and two assists. Jaylen Brown led the second unit with 10-point tally, while Marcus Smart overcame the same stomach virus that had afflicted Bradley to suit up and go for nine points, three assists and a rebound off the bench over 28 minutes. 

The Jazz cross the border and take on the Toronto Raptors in their next contest on Thursday night, while the Celtics remain home and await the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday evening.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 121-116, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday.

In a battle between two middling Eastern Conference teams, the Pacers were able to prevail, thanks to a big fourth quarter. Indiana outscored Detroit 29-24 in the fourth quarter and held them to just 13 points through the first nine minutes of that period. The Pacers offense was on point all evening, as they shot 58 percent from the field, 87 percent from the free-throw line and 56 percent from three-point range. Detroit lost despite winning the rebounding, assisting and turnover battles. 

Indiana (18-18) had just four road wins headed into this matchup, so a fourth quarter surge to grab their fifth is just what they need to find some momentum. Paul George was the player of the game, as he scored a game-high 32 points on 10-of-17 shooting. George actually scored 12 of his 32 points in the final six minutes to secure the win for Indiana. Jeff Teague accrued 17 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Myles Turner totaled 17 points, seven rebounds, two blocks and two steals. Monta Ellis was a huge spark off the bench, dropping 17 points on 6-of-6 shooting. The Pacers have another favorable matchup in their next game, when they host the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday. 

Detroit (16-21) are now just 3-8 across their last 11 games and fourth quarter collapses like this are par for the course right now. The good news is that Reggie Jackson had one of his best games of the year, as he accumulated 20 points, seven rebounds and 12 assists. Andre Drummond recorded another double-double, amassing 20 points, 14 rebounds and two blocks. Tobias Harris led the team in scoring off the bench, as he scored 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting to go along with five boards. Jon Leuer and Marcus Morris scored 14 points a piece, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 16 points and five assists. The Pistons will look to get out of this slide on Thursday against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Washington Wizards, 113-105, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday. 

The Mavericks (10-24) came in to Tuesday's contest with only nine wins on the season, but five of those had come at home. With a Washington Wizards (16-17) team playing on the second game of a back-to-back set, they stood a solid chance of notching their sixth victory in the friendly confines of American Airlines Center, and did just that largely on the strength of a combined 47 points from Harrison Barnes and Deron Williams. The former scored nine of his team-high 26 points in the fourth period, including a 24-foot three-pointer with 24 seconds remaining after the Wizards had closed the gap to 110-105. Overall, Dallas enjoyed one of its better offensive nights of what has been a difficult season, as they generated success rates of 47.4 and 53.1 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively. 

The Wizards were led by John Wall's 27 points, which he supplemented with eight assists, four rebounds, three steals and a block. Bradley Beal followed with 25 points, six assists and four rebounds. Markieff Morris and Otto Porter, Jr. produced matching 13-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds and the latter supplying four rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks. Marcin Gortat continued his excellent work down low, registering 12 points, 16 boards, four assists and a block. 

Barnes supplemented his scoring total with seven rebounds, five assists and a block. Williams compiled 21 points, six assists and a rebound. Wesley Matthews chipped in with 12 points, two rebounds, two assists and a block. Dirk Nowitzki contributed a near-double-double with 11 points and nine boards. Devin Harris posted 17 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal to lead the bench. 

The Wizards heads back home to face off with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday evening, while the Mavericks remain home and await the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Toronto Raptors, 110-82, at AT&T Center on Tuesday. 

These are two teams at the top of the standings, but the Spurs really took it to the Raptors in this beatdown. It was a near wire-to-wire win for San Antonio, as Toronto held just one lead in the first three minutes, with the Spurs leading the rest of the way. Each quarter was decisive, as they won the first quarter by 11, the second quarter by eight and the third quarter by 11. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the biggest difference, with San Antonio dishing out 32 assists to just 15 turnovers, while Toronto committed 11 turnovers to just eight assists. The Spurs shot 55 percent from the field, while holding the Raptors to just 37 percent. 

Toronto (23-11) have been dominant all season, but playing in San Antonio is a different beast altogether. DeMar DeRozan was the only starter with more than 10 points, as he dropped 26 points on 12-of-21 from the field. Kyle Lowry struggled mightily, scoring six points and handing out two assists on 2-of-9 shooting. Terrence Ross was a lone bright spot off the bench, as he provided 17 points and five rebounds. Toronto will have another tough game on Thursday when it hosts the Utah Jazz.

Kawhi Leonard scored a game-high 25 points for San Antonio (28-7), while adding four rebounds, two steals and three blocks on 8-of-12 shooting. LaMarcus Aldridge was second on the team, accumulating 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists on 11-of-16 shooting. Tony Parker continued his recent surge, scoring 15 points and dishing out eight assists. Those were the only San Antonio players in double figures, but the Spurs had 10 other players score in this win. San Antonio will look to keep rolling on Thursday against the Denver Nuggets.

In a battle between two teams battling for the eight-seed in the west, the Kings were able to prevail with a big road win. An 18-2 run in the second quarter was the decisive stretch for Sacramento, as they never relinquished their lead after that big run. Turnovers really killed Denver, as they committed 14 of them, while forcing just eight from the Kings. Sacramento shot 52 percent from the field, with Denver shooting 48 percent on their end. 

Sacramento (15-19) haven't had many road wins to celebrate this season, but this won catapulted them into playoff positioning for the time being. DeMarcus Cousins was once again the catalyst for the Kings, as he accumulated 31 points, six rebounds and six assists. Darren Collison had one of his best games of the season, tallying 26 points and seven assists. Kosta Koufos was the only other starter in double figures, scoring 18 points on 8-of-9 shooting. Arron Afflalo punished his former team with 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting off the bench. The Kings will play again on Wednesday, when they host the injury-riddled Miami Heat. 

Denver (14-21) had to play this game in the second half of a back-to-back set and they clearly were hampered by that fact in this loss. Danilo Gallinari did all he could for the Nuggets, leading the team with 24 points, four rebounds and three assists on 8-of-12 from the field. Nikola Jokic continued his recent surge, collecting 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Jusuf Nurkic was a nice spark off the bench, accruing 16 points, six rebounds and four assists. Things don't get any easier for Denver, as they play the San Antonio Spurs for their next game on Thursday.

												The Phoenix Suns beat the visiting Miami Heat on Tuesday, 99-90.

The Suns (11-25) are spending another season near the bottom of the conference standings, but saw some promising success on Tuesday.  Sophomore guard Devin Booker led the team with 27 points, splashing in three three-pointers along the way.  Meanwhile, veteran center Tyson Chandler was able to feast against a depleted Miami frontcourt, pulling down a whopping 20 rebounds to go with two blocks.  Phoenix pulled away fairly convincingly in the third quarter, establishing a 20-point lead at one point, and was able to stave off a challenge from the Heat late in the fourth.  The team shot almost 47 percent and held its opponent to just 39 percent from the field with six three-pointers.  

Miami (10-26) is in the midst of a dismal run, having now gone 2-9 in its last 11 games.  The team struggled to find offense on Tuesday with star center Hassan Whiteside (eye) out.  Point guard Goran Dragic had a much-needed 24 points to lead the team, also dishing out nine assists.  Forward Willie Reed had a career night as he stepped into the starting lineup.  Reed scored 22 points and had a team-high 18 rebounds, with eight coming on the offensive end.  He added two blocks.  However, the rest of the Heat combined for just 44 points and struggled from beyond the arc.

												The Los Angeles Lakers had an impressive offensive night as they took down the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, 116-102, on Tuesday.

The Lakers (13-25) had 17 three-pointers and 34 assists en route to a double-digit win over the powerhouse Grizzlies.  The commanding performance came as a bit of a surprise for the struggling Lakers, as the team had lost 15 of its last 17 games prior to Tuesday's win.  Six players scored in double digits for Los Angeles, and the team shot a stellar 51 percent from the field.  Guard Nick Young led LA with 20 points, going 6-of-11 while attempting shots exclusively from beyond the arc.  Second-year forward Julius Randle, however, was the biggest difference-maker.  The big man had his second triple-double of the season and the third of his career, as he scored 19 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 11 assists.  

Memphis (22-15) found itself in somewhat of the opposite position of Los Angeles after Tuesday's game.  The Grizzlies had been on a roll, having won four of their last six and sitting comfortably in the playoff picture.  The team struggled on Tuesday, however, shooting just 39 percent and proving unable to defend against LA's powerful perimeter shooters.  Stars Marc Gasol and Mike Conley impressed per usual, scoring 22 and 21 respectively.  The rest of Memphis's lineup was less dominant, however, as the remainder of the starting five combined for just 13.  

The Grizzlies will stay in Los Angeles to face the Clippers on Wednesday, while the Lakers will visit Portland on Thursday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 98-94, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Monday.

The game was a showcase for two of the NBA's hottest talents, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Russell Westbrook, with both players having filled out the stat sheet on a nightly basis to date this season. Neither disappointed in the Monday night showdown, as they both led their respective clubs in scoring. After a big third quarter from the Bucks (17-16) that saw them outscore the Thunder (21-14) by a 29-16 margin, OKC battled back to actually take an 88-86 lead with 5:56 remaining on a Westbrook driving layup. Ultimately, a pair of clutch free throws from standout rookie Malcolm Brogdon with eight seconds remaining following a Westbrook foul gave the Bucks the final margin of victory.

Westbrook scored a game-high 30 points and complemented them with seven rebounds, six assists and three steals over 36 minutes. Steven Adams was his wing man on the night, posting 20 points, eight boards, two assists, a steal and three blocks. Victor Oladipo was solid again in his second game back in action, tallying 18 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal. Semaj Christon paced the bench with 11 points, two assists and a rebound. Andre Roberson and Domantas Sabonis notably both went scoreless over a combined 45 minutes on the court.

Antetokounmpo contributed a 26-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included five assists, a steal and a block. Jabari Parker supplied 19 points, six rebounds, two assists and a block. John Henson chipped in with 12 points, five boards, an assist, a steal and a block. Brodgon matched Henson's scoring total and added five assists and a pair of boards. Greg Monroe continued his strong work off the Milwaukee bench, registering 15 points, seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. 

The Thunder continue their road trip, with their next stop in Charlotte for a Wednesday night showdown with the Hornets. Milwaukee faces off with the Knicks in New York on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 90-82, at Quicken Loans Arena on Monday. 

Cleveland were expected to win this game rather easily, but it took a late run to escape with an important victory. In fact, the Cavaliers outscored the Pelicans, 23-13, in the fourth quarter to cap off their comeback win. There were seven ties and 15 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 10 points. Both squads really struggled shooting, as the Cavaliers hit 38 percent of their shots, while New Orleans shot just 36 percent from the field. Rebounding was the biggest key for the Cavaliers, winning that battle, 56-45. Three-point shooting kept the Pelicans hanging around, as Cleveland went just 6-of-31 from long distance, to New Orleans' 11 of-26. The Cavaliers bench outscored the Pelicans bench, 44-19, as well. 

The Pelicans (14-22) had a tough task here in Cleveland and they nearly pulled out an impressive road win. Anthony Davis once again led the team, as he accumulated 20 points, 17 rebounds and three blocks on 10-of-27 shooting. Buddy Hield tied that team-lead in scoring, as he dropped 20 points of his own, going 4-of-6 from three-point range. Jrue Holiday ran the offense at ease, collecting 11 points, four rebounds, 13 assists and three steals. The Pelicans will return to action on Thursday against the Atlanta Hawks.

The Cavaliers (26-7) had to play this game without Kyrie Irving, but they let their other two studs take care of business. LeBron James carried the load, as he led the team with 26 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Kevin Love recorded a double-double, totaling 12 points and 11 rebounds on 5-of-19 shooting. The other three starters combined for just eight points, as they had three players come off the bench to drop at least 12 points. Richard Jefferson was the most valuable bench player, as he accrued 12 points and 12 rebounds. Cleveland will host the Chicago Bulls for their next game on Thursday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 101-89, at Barclays Center on Monday.

The duo of Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert has often been the bedrock of the Jazz (22-13) offense during the respective absences of George Hill, Rodney Hood and Derrick Favors this season, and the talented pair were at it again Monday, even with the latter two in the lineup. Hayward led the way with a game-high 30 points, while Gobert supplied a 15-point, 16-rebound double-double, the 13th occasion in which he's accomplished the feat over the last 14 contests. The French big man, who's rim-guarding prowess has earned him the nickname of Stifle Tower, added two assists, three blocks and a steal. In typical fashion, the Utah defense also stymied the Nets (8-25) overall, limiting them to a 42.3 percent success rate from the field and eliciting 15 turnovers from their hosts as well.

Hayward supplemented his aforementioned scoring total with four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Shelvin Mack and Hood followed Gobert's lead with matching 15-point efforts, with the former also tallying two rebounds, two assists and three steals, and the latter registering three rebounds and an assist. Joe Johnson led the Jazz second unit with a modest seven points, which he complemented with four boards.

The Nets were paced by Trevor Booker's 17-point, 15-rebound double-double that also featured two assists and a block. Brook Lopez managed 14 points, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks in a tough matchup against Gobert. Isaiah Whitehead drew another start at point guard and went for 12 points, six boards, an assist and a block. Bojan Bogdanovic and Sean Kilpatrick put forth a pair of eight-point performances apiece, while Rondae Hollis-Jefferson continued to be productive in a reserve role with 11 points, a rebound and an assist in just 14 minutes.

The Jazz are right back at it Tuesday night when they take on the Celtics in Boston, while the Nets are off until Thursday evening, when take on the Pacers in Indiana.

												The host Chicago Bulls took down the visiting Charlotte Hornets on Monday, 118-111.  Bulls star Jimmy Butler scored a season-high 52 points, leading his team and recording the NBA's third 50-point game in the last four days.

Butler was an integral piece of the Bulls' (17-18) strong offensive night, as he shot 15-of-24 and an absurd 21-of-22 from the free-throw line.  32 of Butler's points came in the second half, with 11 coming in the final two minutes of what was a tight game.  Chicago's next-highest scorer was bench big man Nikola Mirotic, who had just 12.  On top of his 52 points, Butler recorded a team-high 12 rebounds and six assists, along with three steals on the defensive end.  The Bulls managed to take care of the ball very well, turning it over just nine times on the night. 

Charlotte (19-16), meanwhile, saw strong play from their own star.  Point guard Kemba Walker led the team with 34 points and pulled down 11 rebounds.  The team as a whole shot impressively, hitting over 49 percent of its shots from the field and going 9-of-19 from beyond the arc.  However, the team committed 14 turnovers on the night, errors that made a difference in what was a tight game.  Moreover, the team simply could not find an answer for Jimmy Butler at the end of the game, as Butler scored the majority of Chicago's closing points.

Both teams will face tough competition on Wednesday, as Charlotte hosts the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Bulls travel to Cleveland to face the defending champion Cavaliers.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the host New York Knicks, 115-103, at Madison Square Garden on Monday. 

These are two teams who will battle to sneak into the playoffs, but the Magic looked like the far superior team in this game. They nearly pulled out a wire-to-wire win, as the Knicks never led by more than one and failed to tie or recapture the lead after the first quarter. The assist-to-turnover differential was the decisive statistic, as the Magic recorded 35 assists to just 12 turnovers, while New York committed 18 turnovers to match their 18 assists. Three-point shooting was a big factor as well, with the Magic going 15-of-31, to the Knicks, 8-of-21. 

The Magic (16-20) have been playing much better on the offensive end recently and this performance only adds to those numbers. Serge Ibaka continued his good form, as he tallied 22 points and six rebounds in the win. Aaron Gordon had a nice all-around game too, collecting 22 points, six rebounds and six assists. Jodie Meeks had one of his best games of the season, as he led the team with 23 points on 7-of-9 shooting. Nikola Vucevic recorded a double-double off the bench, totaling 14 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. Elfrid Payton also came off the bench to score 13 points and hand out 14 assists. Orlando will look to build off this win on Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks. 

The Knicks (16-18) have now lost five-straight games, as they continue to fall down the standings. Carmelo Anthony did play despite being ruled questionable with a knee injury and led the team with 19 points, seven rebounds and three assists on 6-of-17 shooting. Derrick Rose was second on the team, as he accrued 18 points, three rebounds and four assists. Brandon Jennings was the only bench player in double figures, as he accumulated 12 points, three rebounds and four assists. The Knicks had to play this game without Kristaps Porzingis, who continues to nurse an Achilles' injury. New York will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday for their next game.

												The Houston Rockets took down the visiting Washington Wizards on Monday, 101-91.

Houston (27-9) may be the league's hottest team, as the Rockets are now 9-2 in their last 11.  Much of the credit for the team's success is due to All-Star guard James Harden, who has led the league in assists and churned out triple-doubles at a ridiculous rate through the early part of the season.  Harden followed a career-best performance against New York on New Year's Eve with his third straight triple-double on Monday against the Wizards.  Despite shooting just 6-of-24, Harden scored 23 points to go with 10 rebounds and 10 assists.  Sharpshooting sixth man Eric Gordon, meanwhile, led the team with 31 points off the bench, including six three-pointers. 

Washington (16-17) had been on a hot streak, going 7-3 in its last 10 games before Monday.  Point guard John Wall was crowned Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the final week of 2016, and continued his strong play in Houston.  Wall scored 18 points and dished out 12 assists.  Shooting guard Bradley Beal led the team with 27 points.  However, the Wizards struggled to find their shot from beyond the arc, going just 6-of-26 from long-range.  

The Wizards will travel to Dallas on Tuesday, while the Rockets will host OKC on Thursday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Phoenix Suns 109-98 at Staples Center on Monday. 

The banged up Clippers (23-14) have gone through a brutal stretch of games, but erased a six game losing streak with a needed win at home. J.J. Reddick and DeAndre Jordan led Los Angeles in a variety of ways and staved off a late Suns (10-25) rally. A tight knit first half saw Los Angeles start to pull away in midway through the second quarter, but T.J. Warren tipped in a shot and Tyson Chandler followed up with a pair of free throws to cut the lead to six points with just over 3:00 remaining in the second quarter. The third quarter saw the Clippers pile on to the building lead, especially after an emphatic Jordan dunk that put Los Angeles up 19 points. Phoenix tried to chip away throughout the final period, and although they flashed signs of getting back into the game behind Eric Bledsoe's slashing to the rim and long three-pointer, they simply ran out of clock before any real drama could have occurred. 

Reddick led the Clippers with 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting across 34 minutes, while Jordan posted a line just one point shy of a massive double-double, as the big man scored nine points and added 20 rebounds and three blocks. Warren and Eric Bledsoe led the Suns in the scoring department, as the two players combined to go for 46 points, while Devin Booker finished with a lowly 13 points on a rough 4-of-15 shooting. The often exciting sophomore scorer also picked up a late technical foul after using the net to try and block one of Reddick's layups off the backboard. 

The Suns will play the second game of a back-to-back on Tuesday when they host the Miami Heat, while the Clippers host the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets 127-119 at Oracle Arena on Monday. 

The Warriors (30-5) picked up their eighth straight home win behind a strong all-around performance from their big scoring three. With the likes of Draymond Green in the mix as the team leader in assists per game this season, he found himself as the outside part of the big three consisting of Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. Green benefited off of his three hot shooting teammates on his way to a triple-double to the tune of 15 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds. Durant rocked the rim multiple times, beating his matchup's off the dribble consistently, while also efficiently connecting from the mid-range. Durant finished with 21 points on 10-of-19 shooting, while Curry added 22 points and Thompson led all scorers with 25 points. The former MVP brought the Warriors within four points of the Nuggets lead with a wild and heavily contested buzzer-beating three point shot to close out the half, and Golden State took the momentum into the third quarter. 

The Nuggets (14-20), who were coming off of a difficult loss to the 76ers on Friday, hung with the high paced Warriors offense for three quarters of basketball. Nikola Jokic flashed big man handles after going behind the back and slamming home a highlight reel dunk, while Will Barton went flying towards the rim on a similar transition possession, as Denver exploited the Warriors weak defensive effort in the paint early on. Jokic finished with 21 points, 13 rebounds and five assists, while Barton added 14 points in 27 minutes. Wilson Chandler matched Jokic's 21 points, but was overmatched when up against Draymond Green or Kevin Durant on the defensive end. 

The Nuggets will visit the Kings in the second game of a back-to-back on Tuesday, while the Warriors host the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 114-112, in overtime at Phillips Arena on Sunday.

Kawhi Leonard made his return for the Spurs (27-7) after a two-game absence due to a stomach virus, but the bigger story on the San Antonio side turned out to be LaMarcus Aldridge, who bounced back nicely from an eight-point performance against his former Trail Blazers teammates on Friday to score 27 points, along with 13 rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Meanwhile, on Atlanta's end, it was Tim Hardaway, Jr. who posted 29 points off the bench. His 26-foot three-point jumper with three seconds remaining in regulation knotted the game at 100, and Leonard's missed 14-foot shot as time expired insured a fifth quarter. Hardaway drained two more three-pointers early and a key free throw late in the extra period, and Leonard missed a driving layup at the buzzer, helping the Hawks (18-16) escape with a hard-fought win. 

Tony Parker tallied 22 points, six assists and three rebounds behind Aldridge. Pau Gasol had a near double-double with 18 points, nine boards, two assists, a steal and a block. Leonard had 13 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Manu Ginobili led the second unit with 10 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. 

Paul Millsap paced the Hawks with 32 points, 13 rebounds, three assists and a block. Hardaway supplemented his point total with five rebounds and an assist. Dennis Schroder followed with 16 points, 10 assists, two rebounds and a block. Kyle Korver posted 14 points, eight rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block in 39 minutes off the bench. Kent Bazemore, Thabo Sefolosha and Dwight Howard notably underwhelmed on the starting five, combining for just 17 points overall. 

The Spurs head back home to face the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday evening, while the Hawks head to Orlando for a Wednesday night date with the Magic.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Miami Heat, 107-98, at American Airlines Arena on Sunday. 

While there were only two ties and five lead changes in total, this game was close throughout. Miami actually led for the first 30 minutes, while the Pistons took their first lead in the third quarter and never looked back. Defense in the second half was key for Detroit, as they held Miami to just 32 points in that 24-minute stretch. Rebounding was the biggest factor in Detroit's win, as they won that battle, 48-34. They also dominated scoring down low as well, as they outscored the Heat, 42-26 in the paint. 

The Pistons (16-20) have been in a terrible rut recently, but this is a big road win to get them closer to .500. Reggie Jackson had his best game of the season, as he led the team with 27 points, two rebounds and four assists. Andre Drummond was equally as good, as he totaled 25 points, 18 rebounds and two blocks. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the only other starter with more than 11, as he tallied 23 points, six rebounds and five assists. More importantly, those three players combined to go 31-of-51 from the field. Detroit will return to action on Tuesday in a home matchup against the Indiana Pacers. 

The Heat (10-25) had to play this game without Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside and Justise Winslow, as they simply didn't have enough bullets to win this fight. Josh Richardson had to carry the load, as he accumulated 14 points, eight assists and two steals in the loss. Wayne Ellington led the starters in scoring, as he accrued 18 points, four rebounds and three assists. James Johnson led the team in scoring off the bench, collecting 20 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Miami will look to get out of this slide on Thursday against the Phoenix Suns.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Orlando Magic, 117-104, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday. 

Indiana got out to a hot start in the first quarter and they never looked back after that. In fact, the Pacers took a 27-17 lead after the first quarter, as they never trailed after that. The Indiana offense was as efficient as ever, going 50 percent from the field, 41 percent from three-point range and 92 percent from the free-throw line. Defensive rebounding was a huge factor as well, with the Pacers winning that battle, 38-32. 

Orlando (15-20) have not been able to get a winning-streak going this season, as their defense continues to falter. Serge Ibaka led the starters in scoring, as he totaled 17 points and eight rebounds in the loss. Nikola Vucevic led the team in scoring, as he accrued 18 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Jeff Green provided 17 points on his own off the bench on 7-of-12 shooting. Aaron Gordon went just 4-of-10 from the field, to finish with 13 points and six rebounds. On deck for the Magic is a road matchup with the New York Knicks on Monday.  

Indiana (17-18) needed this win after a poor stretch and they didn't let fans down in this offensive showcase. Myles Turner was the player of the game, as he accumulated 23 points, 12 rebounds and three assists on 7-of-13 shooting. Paul George was second on the team, collecting 19 points, five rebounds and three assists. Jeff Teague scored just 12 points, but dished out nine assists in the win. Off the bench, Al Jefferson scored 12 points, while Aaron Brooks dropped 14 of his own. Indiana will look to keep rolling against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers beat the host Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday, 95-89.

With star point guard Damian Lillard (ankle) sidelined, shooting guard C.J. McCollum led the Blazers (15-21) to victory with a career-high 43 points.  McCollum had been performing at a high level with Lillard out, averaging 26.0 points per game over the team's last three games.  Sunday, however, saw the biggest performane of McCollum's career, as the guard scored 43 points along with five rebounds, three assists, three steals, and a block.  As a team, the Blazers had a respectable offensive night despite shooting just 6-of-22 from beyond the arc.  Portland finished the game shooting over 49 percent from the field.

Minnesota (11-23), meanwhile, kept the game close despite a shoddy shooting night.  The team hit just 40 percent of its shots and only seven three-pointers.  Leading scorer Andrew Wiggins still impressed, however, scoring 24 points and shooting 10-of-20 from the field.  Star center Karl-Anthony Towns, meanwhile, had an off night on offense, scoring just 11 points and shooting only 3-of-15 overall.

												The visiting Toronto Raptors defeated the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, 123-114.

Toronto (23-10) needed the win after having dropped two straight games earlier in the week.  The team was treated to a close game by the struggling Lakers, but pulled away in the fourth quarter due in large part to the play of All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry.  Lowry scored 18 points in the fourth quarter and 41 overall to go with nine rebounds and seven assists.  He shot 12-of-16, playing a big part in Toronto's 56 percent shooting on the night.  Lowry was complemented by backcourt partner DeMar DeRozan, who had 31 points.  Overall, the team shot impeccably, hitting 10 three-pointers and over 90 percent of its free-throws en route to the win.

Los Angeles (12-25), meanwhile, has struggled mightily since starting the season at 8-8.  The team put up a strong fight in the first three quarters but was buried by the Raptors' All-Star backcourt at the end of the game.  The Lakers saw strong play from its own backcourt, as D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young scored 28 and 26 points, respectively.  However, the team struggled to find true offensive rhythm, hitting just 40 percent of its shots on the night.

The Raptors will close their road trip on Tuesday in San Antonio, while the Lakers will host the Grizzlies.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Sacramento Kings, 112-98, at Golden 1 Center on Saturday afternoon.

The Grizzlies (22-14) benefited from the return of star point guard Mike Conley, who'd missed the previous two contests with a toe injury. The veteran looked fully healthy and well-rested after his brief layoff, scoring a team-high 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field, which included a 3-of-5 tally from three-point range. He complemented his offense with eight rebounds, three assists and a block. Memphis had the hot hand overall, posting respective success rates of 50.6 and 48.6 percent from the floor and behind the arc. Meanwhile, they played their typically stingy defense, holding the Kings (14-19) to 43.1 percent shooting and inducing 12 turnovers from them. 

JaMychal Green provided solid support for Conley, going for 18 points, seven rebounds, four assists and a steal. Tony Allen provided 11 points, four boards, an assist and a steal. Chandler Parsons continued his slow journey back to full health, posting seven points, two assists, a rebound and a steal over 16 minutes. Marc Gasol had a particularly quiet effort, amassing just two points on a pair of free throws and adding only two rebounds and two assists over 21 minutes. Zach Randolph co-led the second unit with 14 points, six rebounds and three assists to make up for some of that offensive void, while the ageless Vince Carter matched his point total and supplemented it with three rebounds, a steal and a block. Troy Daniels supplied 11 points in a reserve role as well. 

DeMarcus Cousins led the way for Sacramento with a game-high 26 points, along with eight assists, four rebounds and five steals. Matt Barnes got the start at small forward and totaled 20 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Darren Collison compiled 16 points, four rebounds and two assists. Anthony Tolliver came off the bench to register 16 points, six rebounds and two assists over 28 minutes.

The Grizzlies next head to Los Angeles for a Tuesday evening date with the Lakers, while the Kings travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Tuesday night as well.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 116-96, at United Center on Saturday.

The dynamic duo of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker were at it again for the Bucks (16-16), as they posted over half of the team's scoring total while each played at least 40 minutes. Their combined 23-of-34 effort from the field spearheaded a red-hot Milwaukee offense that drained their buckets at a 56.6 percent clip, and that also was successful on 60 percent of their 15 attempts from behind the arc. Meanwhile, the Bulls (16-18) could only get one such standout effort, which came from Jimmy Butler. The offensive imbalance ultimately left them unable to keep pace as the game wore on, and accordingly, the Bucks outscored their hosts by a 67-45 margin in the second half. 

Antetokounmpo tallied a game-high 35 points, and added nine rebounds, seven assists, seven blocks and two steals in a remarkable performance. Parker followed with 27 points, five rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block. Malcolm Brogdon continued his rapid development, as he managed 15 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds, his first career triple-double. Greg Monroe led the bench with 15 points, 12 rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals. 

Butler's 26 points paved the way for Chicago, and he complemented them with eight assists, seven boards and two steals. Robin Lopez provided a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a block. Taj Gibson contributed 11 points, five rebounds, an assist and a block. Michael Carter-Williams, who drew the start for the struggling Rajon Rondo, and Dwyane Wade both struggled, as they only supplied four and eight points, respectively. Doug McDermott (13 points, three assists, a rebound and a steal) and Nikola Mirotic (10 points, four rebounds) helped make up for some of the scoring void off the bench.

The Bucks head back home to host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night, while the Bulls remain home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Monday evening as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 121-109, at Spectrum Center on Saturday.

The Cavs (25-7) entered the contest down one of their Big Three, as Kyrie Irving's hamstring strain proved too much to play on. That left a larger load than usual on the capable shoulders of LeBron James and Kevin Love, and as customary, both All-Stars were up to the challenge. However, Kemba Walker was in no mood to let the Hornets (19-15) back down from the reigning NBA champs on Charlotte's home court, and went off for a game-high 37 points. He supplemented his scoring haul with five rebounds and five assists over 35 minutes, and went 13-of-22 from the field overall. Despite his remarkable effort and the fact that the Hornets managed a 51.3 percent success rate from the field, the visitors still proved to be a bit too much to handle, as they drained their buckets at an equally impressive 50.6 percent clip, including 45.2 percent from three-point range. 

James' 32 points led Cleveland, and he added nine assists, six boards and a steal. Love provided a 28-point, 10-rebound double-double, while Jordan McRae, drawing the start in Irving's stead, totaled 20 points, four rebounds and an assist while putting on a shooting clinic. The second-year guard was 8-of-12 from the floor, including 3-of-4 from three-point range. Tristan Thompson supplied 11 points, six rebounds and a steal and Kay Felder, another young backcourt player getting extended opportunity due to Irving's injury, led the second unit with 13 points. 

Frank Kaminsky III was actually second in scoring behind Walker on the Hornets, as he registered 15 points and five rebounds. Nicolas Batum compiled 13 points, eight assists, six rebounds and a pair of blocks in another stat-sheet-stuffing outing. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist amassed 12 points, eight rebounds and a block, while Marvin Williams managed 10 points, four rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the New York Knicks, 129-122, at Toyota Center on Saturday. 

This has been the year of the triple-double, but there hasn't been a performance like this in quite some time. James Harden accumulated 53 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists on the way to his best game of his career. His game carried this offense to some gaudy numbers too, as they recorded 30 assists and went 21-of-55 from three-point range. There were no ties and only one lead change, as the Rockets never relinquished the lead after the second quarter. 

New York (16-17) had to play this game extremely shorthanded and they did a good job of hanging around against a potent Houston attack. Kristaps Porzingis sat this game out with an Achilles injury and Carmelo Anthony had to depart early due to renewed knee soreness. That put Brandon Jennings in the starting lineup and he didn't disappoint, as he led the team with 32 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Derrick Rose also played well, accumulating 21 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Joakim Noah recorded a 15-point, 16-rebound double-double in the loss. On deck for the Knicks is a home matchup against the Orlando Magic on Monday. 

Houston (26-9) have gotten some unbelievable performances from James Harden this season, but this one tops them all. Harden finished the game with 53 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists in the best game of his career. Ryan Anderson helped him get those assists up, as he was second on the team with 25 points and six rebounds on 8-of-12 shooting. Montrezl Harrell got a rare start at center and amassed 13 points, four rebounds and four assists on 6-of-7 shooting. They'll look to keep rolling on Monday against the Washington Wizards.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Phoenix Suns, 91-86, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday. 

While the Jazz were expected to win this game rather easily, it took a monster effort to beat this battling Suns team. This game was tight throughout, as there were eight ties and 20 lead changes, with neither team grabbing a double-digit lead. Defense was key for the Jazz, as they held the Suns to 41 percent shooting and just nine assists. Utah shot 48 percent on their end and recorded 17 assists.  

Phoenix (10-24) are in a tough stretch right now, as this marks their seventh loss in their last nine games. Devin Booker led the team in scoring, as he tallied 20 points, three rebounds and three steals. Eric Bledsoe was the team's best player though, as he accumulated 19 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Tyson Chandler was the only other starter to play well, as he totaled eight points and 11 rebounds. Leandro Barbosa led the bench in scoring, dropping 12 points and five rebounds. Phoenix will return to action on Monday against a struggling Los Angeles Clippers squad. 

Utah (21-13) didn't play their best game against the Suns, but they did enough to escape with a win. Rudy Gobert continued his fantastic season, as he tied the team-lead with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Gordon Hayward matched that 18-point total, adding nine rebounds and four assists to his tally. George Hill left after just seven minutes, as he re-injured the foot that kept him out for over a month. Derrick Favors neared a double-double, as he amassed nine points eight rebounds and three assists. Utah will look to keep rolling on Monday against the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 114-88, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday. 

With the recent form of these teams a Thunder blowout was the expected result and they didn't disappoint. In fact, Oklahoma City got out to a 33-12 lead after the first quarter and never looked back. All the statistics were in the Thunder's favor, as they won the shooting, assisting, rebounding, steals, blocks and turnover categories. The assist-to-turnover differential was the biggest factor, with the Clippers recording 14 assists and 15 turnovers, while the Thunder committed just eight turnovers to 25 assists. 

The Clippers (22-14) are in a nightmare slump right now, as they've lost five-straight games. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin sat out this game with differing ailments and the secondary players simply didn't do enough. Austin Rivers led the starters in scoring, as he tallied 14 points and three assists on 3-of-11 shooting. Deandre Jordan was the starter to shoot over 40 percent, as he finished with nine points and 11 rebounds on 4-of-5 shooting. Brandon Bass was a lone bright spot, as he amassed 18 points and six rebounds on 7-of-9 shooting off the bench. Marreese Speights played well off the bench too, dropping 18 points and five boards. The Clippers will look to get out of this slide on Monday against the Phoenix Suns.

The Thunder (21-13) have gotten a historic season from Russell Westbrook and he only added to his numbers with yet another triple-double. Westbrook actually sat out the fourth quarter, as he recorded his triple-double late in the second quarter. He finished the game with 17 points, 12 rebounds and 14 assists. Victor Oladipo made his return from a wrist injury to accrue 15 points, four rebounds and two assists. Enes Kanter led the team in scoring, as he totaled 23 points and eight rebounds off the bench. The Thunder will look to keep rolling on Monday against the Milwaukee Bucks.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Chicago Bulls, 111-101, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday afternoon.

The Pacers (16-18), and particularly Paul George, may have had some redemption on their minds against the Bulls (16-17) on Friday. The All-Star forward had been limited to just 14 points last Monday at United Center in a 90-85 loss, his lowest scoring total since Nov. 14. He made sure the tables were turned this go-around, as he went for a game-high 32 points, 11 of which came in the final 4:30 of the game, and he complemented the offense with four rebounds, an assist and two steals. It was his second straight 30-point game, and with another perfect 9-of-9 effort from the foul line, he upped his tally in that category to 17-of-17 over the last two contests. His stellar performance spearheaded a Pacers squad that managed a 48.1 percent success rate from the field, and a serviceable 36.8 percent figure from behind the arc.

Chicago was led by their own standout forward in Jimmy Butler, who went for 25 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. Dwyane Wade came back successfully from the migraines that had caused an early exit for him on Wednesday, posting 20 points, five assists, two rebounds and two steals. Taj Gibson compiled 10 points, five boards, an assist and a steal. Cristiano Felicio and Michael Carter-Williams supplied matching 12-point totals off the bench, with the former also hauling in 12 rebounds, dishing out a pair of assists and recording a steal, and the latter also registering eight boards and recording an assist and a block. Doug McDermott was productive in a reserve role as well with 10 points, four rebounds, two assists and a steal. Rajon Rondo notably played only 11 minutes, going scoreless and providing only a rebound and an assist.

Thaddeus Young was second on Indiana with 17 points, six rebounds and two assists. Myles Turner amassed 15 points, three boards and four blocks. Glenn Robinson III posted a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a steal.  Jeff Teague mustered only seven points on 2-of-13 shooting but handed out 17 assists, brought down six rebounds and notched a pair of steals. Aaron Brooks and C.J. Miles paced the bench with a pair of eight-point contributions. 

The Bulls head back home to face off with the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday evening, while the Pacers remain home and await the Orlando Magic for a New Year's Day showdown.

The Wizards (16-16) learned earlier in the day that Bradley Beal would rest his sprained right ankle against the Nets (8-24), which pushed Sheldon McClellan into the starting lineup alongside John Wall. Beal's absence was rather easy to overcome, however, as Washington dominated a reeling Brooklyn squad that's only won one road game all season from the opening tip. Wall led the way for the Wizards' first unit with a 19-point, 14-assist double-double that also included two rebounds, four steals and a block. The home team also received standout performances from Marcin Gortat and Wall's backup Trey Burke, who paced the team overall with a season-high 27 points. Washington had the collective hot hand on offense, shooting 56.6 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range. 

The Nets were led by Trevor Booker, who posted 16 points, seven boards and three assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson matched Booker's point total in 29 minutes off the bench, and added five rebounds, an assist and a steal. Bojan Bogdanovic went for 12 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Brook Lopez compiled 11 points, six assists, five rebounds and a steal. Sean Kilpatrick (seven points) and Isaiah Whitehead (six points) underwhelmed, however, going a combined 4-of-14 from the field. Caris Levert was productive in a reserve role, supplying 12 points in 24 minutes.

Burke added two rebounds, two assists and two steals to his game-high scoring total. Gortat produced a 19-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist, a steal and a block. Otto Porter, Jr. chipped in with 12 points, four boards, two assists, a steal and a block, while Markieff Morris registered 10 points, six rebounds and a steal. McClellan went for eight points in his spot start, and Jason Smith totaled 10 points, eight rebounds, an assist and two blocks in just 18 minutes on the second unit.

The Nets head back home to take on the Utah Jazz on Monday night, while the Wizards head west to take on the Houston Rockets on Monday evening as well.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Miami Heat, 117-114, at TD Garden on Friday.

Boston were expected to win this game rather easily, but the Heat gave them a run for their money. There were 12 ties and 18 lead changes in total, as neither squad led by more than eight points. Both offenses were impressive, as Boston shot 51 percent, while Miami shot 53 percent. It was three-point shooting and free-throw shooting that decided the game, with the Celtics going 83 percent (24-of-29) from the free-throw line and 53 percent (17-of-32) from long distance. The Heat went just 70 percent (7-of-10) from the charity stripe and 39 percent from three (11-of-28) on their end. 

Miami (10-24) have made a habit of losing close games throughout the season, as this marks their 22nd loss by 12 points or less. Josh Richardson stepped up in the absence of Goran Dragic though, as he led the starters with 19 points, six rebounds, eight assists and four steals. The bench is what kept the Heat hanging around, as Wayne Ellington, James Johnson and Tyler Johnson all scored at least 14 points. Tyler Johnson finished the game with 19 points, four rebounds and six assists, while James Johnson led the team with 22 points, three rebounds and six assists. Justise Winslow accumulated 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists of his own.  Hassan Whiteside's recent struggles continued, as he totaled just 11 points, eight rebounds and one block in the loss. Miami will return to action on Sunday versus the Detroit Pistons. 

Boston (20-14) have gotten a career year out of Isaiah Thomas this season and they got a career night out of him in this win. Thomas dropped a career-high 52 points, with 27 of those coming in the fourth quarter. Strangely, he failed to provide an assist, but he went 15-of-26 from the field and 9-of-13 from three-point range in his historic night. Al Horford was the only other player in double figures, as he accrued 21 points, six rebounds and four assists on 8-of-12 shooting. No other player on the roster had more than nine points, five rebounds or five assists. The Celtics will be off until Tuesday, when they play the Utah Jazz for their next game.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the New York Knicks, 104-92, at Smoothie King Center on Friday.

The Pelicans came out with some fire early on, as they wouldn't allow the Knicks to comeback in this game. In fact, New Orleans took a 31-21 lead after the first quarter, as the Knicks only had one lead after that, which lasted less than two minutes. Defense was key for the Pelicans, as the Knicks shot 38 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. In addition, New Orleans won the assisting and turnover battles, en route to their 12-point win. 

New York (16-16) got down early in this game and they simply couldn't recover after that. Their ""big three"" did all they could though, as they each scored at least 20 points in the defeat. Carmelo Anthony led the team, as he tallied 26 points, 13 rebounds and three assists. Kristaps Porzingis also double-doubled, as he totaled 21 points, 12 rebounds and three assists. Derrick Rose dropped 20 points to go along with his three steals. Justin Holiday was the only player with more than five points, as he collected eight points, seven rebounds and four assists off the bench. On deck for the Knicks is a road matchup with the Houston Rockets on Saturday. 

New Orleans (14-21) has now won five of their last six games, as they continue to get healthy. Anthony Davis went off once again, as he led the team with 23 points and 18 rebounds. Tyreke Evans was second on the team, as he provided 16 points, five rebounds and four assists off the bench. Jrue Holiday recorded a double-double, as he accrued 12 points, four rebounds and 11 assists in the win. E'Twaun Moore and Buddy Hield scored 12 points a piece. The Pelicans will look to keep rolling on Tuesday against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Houston Rockets, 140-116, at Toyota Center on Friday.

These are two teams going in opposite directions right now, as the Rockets put it to the Clippers in this blowout win. Not only did they score at least 32 points in every quarter, they shot 56 percent from the field against one of the best defenses in the NBA. The Rockets did have a 26-point lead that was brought down to six in the fourth quarter, but they responded with a 16-0 run to take control late.  Houston took advantage of a happy whistle, as they went 36-of-43 from the free-throw line, while Los Angles took just 16 free-throw attempts. The Rockets also won the rebounding (45-38) and assisting (29-22) differential by seven a piece, as they never trailed after the first quarter. 

The Clippers (22-13) had to play this game without Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, as they were simply outmatched against a hot Rockets bunch. The frustration hit the fan too, as Austin Rivers and Doc Rivers were both ejected in the second quarter. Raymond Felton did all he could to keep them hanging around, as he led the team with 26 points, five rebounds and eight assists off the bench. DeAndre Jordan led the starters in his homecoming game, as he totaled 20 points and 13 rebounds on 9-of-11 shooting. Jamal Crawford and J.J. Redick struggled, as they combined for 13 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Marreese Speights played well off the bench, accruing 15 points and seven rebounds. Los Angeles will look to play better on Saturday, when they play the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road. 

The Rockets (25-9) have been dominant on offense all season, but this 140-spot marked their high of the year. James Harden recorded yet another triple-double, as he accumulated 30 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists and five steals on 10-of-15 shooting. Montrezl Harrell was second on the team, as he dropped a career-high 29 points on 10-of-14 shooting off the bench. Trevor Ariza collected 18 points, four rebounds and seven assists, while Patrick Beverley provided 15 points, seven rebounds and three assists of his own. Eric Gordon scored 19 points off the bench on 5-of-7 shooting. Houston plays again on Saturday, as they host the New York Knicks for their next game.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the visiting Milwaukee Bucks 116-99, at Target Center on Friday evening. 

The Timberwolves (11-22) led wire-to-wire as they shot 13-of-25 from long range and 55.8 percent from the field, en route to their second straight home win.

Andrew Wiggins was the high-point man in the contest with 31 on 10-of-18 shooting, and 11-of-13 from the foul line. Zach LaVine was on fire from downtown as he shot 6-of-9 from deep, finishing with 24 points in the game, while Karl-Anthony Towns controlled the middle, as he finished with 18 points and 16 rebounds. Shabazz Muhammad provided the T-Wolves with a huge boost of the bench, as he poured in 22 points, while shooting 4-of-5 from deep. The Timberwolves are now 6-11 at home and will look to keep the momentum going as they play host to the Trail Blazers on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, despite great performances from Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker, who combined for 45 points, the Bucks (15-16) came up short in the third game of their current four-game road trip. Antetokounmpo notched his 10th straight 20-point game, which is a career-high streak for him. He finished with a team-high 25 points, along with seven assists and five rebounds, in 32 minutes. Parker followed up with 20 points, while Malcolm Brogdon tallied 11 points, four rebounds and four assists, in his first NBA start.

												The Atlanta Hawks held off the Pistons to earn the 105-98 home win, at Phillips Arena on Friday. 

After trailing by 10 at halftime, the Pistons (15-20) battled back to make it a four-point game with four minutes to go, however the Hawks (17-16) executed down the stretch to hold on for their second straight win. 

The Hawks dominated the paint, where they outscored the Pistons 46-32. Atlanta's big men led the way, as Paul Millsap was the high-point man, with 26, while Dwight Howard tallied 10 points and 15 rebounds. Kyle Korver came up big with 22 points on 7-of-13 shooting, in 29 minutes off the bench, while Dennis Schroder helped ice the game with some clutch free throw shooting, and 17 points and seven assists in the contest. The Hawks improve to 9-7 at home and will look to keep the momentum going as they play host to the Spurs on Sunday. 

Despite all five starters scoring in double figures, the Pistons still came up short, in part due to a very limited contribution from the bench, as only three players came off the bench to combine for 15 points. Jon Leuer led the way in scoring for Detroit, as he totaled 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting, along with six rebounds. Andre Drummond chipped in 15 points and 15 rebounds, while Reggie Jackson struggled from the field, but still finished with 20 points and eight assists. This marks the second straight loss for the Pistons, as they fall to 6-12 on the road this season. They will look to get back on track as they go on to play in Miami on Sunday.

												The San Antonio Spurs dominated the second half in order to rally back and defeat the visiting Portland Trail Blazers 110-94, at AT&T center on Friday evening. 

The Spurs outscored the Blazers 63-42 in the second half to completely nullify the five-point deficit that they had faced at half time, and earn their fourth straight win. 

The Spurs (27-6) were without Kawhi Leonard for the second straight game as he remained sideline with an illness. However, Jonathon Simmons stepped up to lead San Antonio in scoring with 19 points, in 30 minutes off the bench. Four other players scored in double digits for the Spurs, including Tony Parker and Danny Green, who finished with 18 points each. The Spurs gave up an uncharacteristic 17 turnovers, including nine in the first quarter alone, but were able to make up for it by shooting 50 percent from the field, including hitting 11-of-22 from long range. The Spurs move to 11-4 at home, as they went 3-0 on their three-game home stand. They now look ahead to a contest in Atlanta on Sunday.  

The Blazers (14-21) were also without a star player, as Damian Lillard missed his third straight game with a sprained ankle. Meanwhile, C.J. McCollum led the way in scoring for the Blazers for the fourth game in a row, as he finished with 29 points, on 10-of-19 shooting, in the contest. The only other players to score in double digits for Portland were Maurice Harkless, who finished with 12 points, and Allen Crabbe, who chipped in 11 points. Eight players came off the bench for the Trail Blazers, and combined for only 28 points. The Blazers dropped to 5-14 on the road and are 2-9 in their last 11 games. They face a tough challenge ahead as their next game, on Sunday in Minnesota, marks the second game of a three-game road trip, which ends in Golden State on January 4th.

												The visiting Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Denver Nuggets on Friday, 124-122.

Philadelphia (8-24) saw strong big man play in Friday's win, with rookie center Joel Embiid taking the reigns.  Embiid led the team with 23 points and also had six rebounds, five assists, two steals, and three blocks.  Despite playing on limited minutes due to a foot injury that robbed him of two full seasons of play, Embiid is the runaway favorite for Rookie of the Year this season.  Forward Ersan Ilyasova also scored 23 and recorded a team-high 13 rebounds.  Philly was able to get the edge in the game with stellar shooting from long range, knocking down 16 three-pointers on the night.

Denver (14-19) was also led by its young standout center.  Sophomore Nikola Jokic scored 25 points to go with seven rebounds and four assists.  Jokic has led all centers in assists since being moved into the starting lineup. Sophomore point guard Emmanuel Mudiay, meanwhile, had a rare night of offensive efficiency, scoring 22 points on 7-of-11 shooting. The Nuggets as a whole shot over 47 percent from the field, but could not find the three-point shooting to match Philly.  

Both teams will enjoy a few days of rest carrying into the New Year.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the Dallas Mavericks on Friday, 108-99.

Golden State (29-5) made easy work of the Mavs, holding onto a double-digit lead for the majority of the game.  Former MVP Kevin Durant helped secure the win with an impressive triple-double.  Durant had 19 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.  All-Star Klay Thompson led the team with 29 points, while reigning MVP Steph Curry kept it fairly quiet with only 14 points and five assists.  It was another big night overall for the Warriors' historically strong offense, as the team shot 50 percent from the field, sank 11 three-pointers, and dished 31 assists.

Dallas (10-24) has picked it up since its horrendous start to the season, but struggled on Friday against the league's top team.  Veteran Dirk Nowitzki played only 23 minutes and shot just 3-of-12 for 11 points.  Harrison Barnes, meanwhile, scored 25 points and recorded two steals.  Barnes was the lone bright spot in what was a tough night for the Mavs, as the team shot just 41 percent from the field and 25 percent from three-point range.

The Mavericks will enjoy a few days of rest, while Golden State will take the court on Monday against the Denver Nuggets.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Miami Heat, 91-82, at Spectrum Center on Thursday.

The refrain is a familiar one for the Hornets (19-14), but doesn't seem to get old: The dynamic duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum supply a significant portion of the offense, and the complementary pieces around them step up in support as needed. That formula equaled another home victory for Charlotte on Thursday, their 11th of the season in 17 home games. Walker scored a game-high 22 points, while Batum provided 16. The hosts also played superior team defense, holding the Heat (10-23) to 40.2 percent shooting overall and inducing 16 turnovers. 

Miami was paced by Josh Richardson, who followed up a 22-point outing against the Thunder on Tuesday with another 20 points on Thursday, along with four rebounds, two assists, a block and a steal. Tyler Johnson came off the bench to supply 18 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Wayne Ellington provided 12 points, two boards and an assist in a reserve role as well. The returning Goran Dragic could only muster five points on 2-of-11 shooting, although he did add eight assists, three rebounds and a steal. Hassan Whiteside went for eight points, 10 rebounds and two blocks, notably taking only seven shots on the night. 

Walker complemented his aforementioned scoring total with seven rebounds, four assists and a steal. Batum filled out the stat sheet with 13 rebounds, eight assists, three steals and a block. Marvin Williams registered 13 points, two assists, a rebound and a steal.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 114-80, at FedEx Forum on Thursday.

The Grizzlies (21-14) have a well-earned defensive reputation, but their thorough domination of the Thunder (20-13) was significantly helped by the ejection of Russell Westbrook for back-to-back technical fouls after 23 minutes for arguing a referee's call. However, Memphis did earn the victory through their own strong offensive play as well, as they tallied superb 52.4 and 59.1 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively. Meanwhile, without their MVP, the Thunder's offense was largely neutered, as only two reserves, Enes Kanter and Alex Abrines, managed to get into double digits in the scoring column. 

Westbrook led OKC in scoring despite the early exit, supplying 21 points to go along with five rebounds and two steals, although he notably did not record any assists. Kanter totaled 19 points and five rebounds, while Abrines managed 10 points and three boards. Steven Adams mustered only six points but did haul in 15 rebounds and added two assists and two blocks. However, Andre Roberson, Domantas Sabonis and Anthony Morrow could only register two points apiece.

The Grizzlies were paced by Marc Gasol, who compiled 25 points, eight rebounds, two assists, a steal and five blocks. The next two highest point totals came from the bench, as Troy Daniels posted 22 points, along with three rebounds and two assists, and Zach Randolph went for 21 points, eight boards and two assists. JaMychal Green produced 17 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block, and Andrew Harrison, drawing another start for Mike Conley, tallied 10 points. Chandler Parsons returned after taking off the last game for rest purposes and produced two points, three assists and two steals over 15 minutes.

The Thunder return home to face the Los Angeles Clippers on New Year's Eve, while the Grizzlies are at Sacramento on Saturday afternoon as well.

												The host Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Boston Celtics on Thursday, 124-118.

Cleveland (24-7) remains the Eastern Conference's top team, having now won five of its last six games.  The Cavs saw a fantastic performance from their big three on Thursday, with Kyrie Irving scoring a team-high 32 points.  Irving added 12 assists and three steals and shot a ridiculous 12-of-17 in what was a truly tremendous performance.  Not far behind Irving was Kevin Love, who scored 30 points and pulled down a team-high 15 rebounds.  LeBron James, meanwhile, scored 23 points, dished out 11 assists, and pulled  down eight rebounds.  As a whole, Cleveland had an impressive night, shooting over 51 percent and draining 14 three-pointers.  

The Celtics (19-14), meanwhile, had an impressive offensive night of their own.  The team shot over 50 percent and had 12 three-pointers, with a large chunk of their offense coming in the fourth quarter.  After trailing by 20, Boston went on a 23-7 run and eventually pulled within one point of the defending champions.  All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas led the team with 31 points and dished out nine assists.  Forward Jonas Jerebko, meanwhile, played an instrumental role off the bench, chipping in 12 points and seven rebounds in 17 minutes of play.  

The Celtics will host the Heat on Friday, while the Cavs will visit Charlotte on Saturday.

												The host Utah Jazz blew out the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday, 100-83.

Utah (20-13) has won two in a row after sliding a bit towards the middle of the month.  The team welcomed the return of point guard George Hill (toe) on Thursday, and Hill made an immediate impact while sliding into his old starting role.  Hill led the team with 21 points to go along with eight rebounds and six assists.  Center Rudy Gobert, meanwhile, led the team with 13 rebounds and played lockdown defense, coming away with two blocks and two steals.  The game was close heading into the fourth, when Utah took over and turned the contest into an utter shellacking.  The Jazz outscored the Sixers 30-9 in the fourth quarter.

Philadelphia (7-24) holds the league's worst record once again, a title it finished with in two of the previous three seasons. On Thursday, rookie Joel Embiid sat out for rest, leaving Philadelphia with little in the way of offensive firepower. Forward Ersan Ilyasova led the team with 16 points and had a team-high 12 rebounds.  The Sixers looked truly lost down the stretch, scoring only nine in the final quarter.

Philly will take on Denver on Friday, while the Jazz will host Phoenix on Saturday.

												The host Phoenix Suns took down the powerhouse Toronto Raptors on Thursday, 99-91.

Phoenix (10-23) has struggled all season but found a big win on Thursday.  Point guard Eric Bledsoe continued to play a leading role for the Suns, as he scored 22 points and dished out 10 assists.  Sophomore Devin Booker, meanwhile, scored 19.  The Suns led at halftime but pulled away in the third quarter, outscoring Toronto 34-22.  Phoenix held Toronto to just 40 percent shooting and seven three-pointers, as well as forcing 18 turnovers on the night.

Toronto (22-10) has now lost two straight amidst a tough six-game road trip.  The Raptors remain in second place in the Eastern Conference but are facing a widening gap between themselves and first-place Cleveland.  Both Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan scored 24 on Thursday, but unfortunately for Toronto, the All-Star firepower was not enough to jump-start the team's offense.  The remaining Raptors combined for only 43 points, and the team shot only 25 percent from three-point range.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 101-89, at Staples Center on Thursday. 

In a battle between a young team and a veteran bunch, the elders were able to escape with a much needed victory. It was the third quarter in which the Mavericks took control, as they outscored the Lakers, 31-13, after trailing by double-digits in the first half. Strangely enough, there was only one tie and two lead changes, as that one momentum swing was extremely decisive. The Dallas offense was on point, as they shot 49 percent from the field, 79 percent from the free-throw line and 45 percent from three-point range. They also dominated the rebounding and assists, as they won the rebounding differential, 42-34 and the assist battle, 24-15.

Dallas (10-23) had just three road wins coming into this matchup, but they showed some serious fight in the second half to get that tally to four. Deron Williams was the catalyst of the offense, as he dished out 11 assists to go along with his eight points before fouling out in the final seconds. Harrison Barnes went just 6-of-17 from the field, but finished with 17 points, nine rebounds and four assists in the win. Wesley Matthews led the team in scoring, as he dropped 20 points to add to his six boards. Devin Harris and Dwight Powell came off the bench to score 14 points a piece.The Mavericks have a tough task ahead of them, as they play the Golden State Warriors on Friday for their next game.

Los Angeles (12-24) continues to falter, as they've now lost 13 of their last 15 games. Julius Randle led the team in scoring, as he accrued 18 points, four rebounds and three assists. Nick Young was lights out shooting, as he scored 17 points on 5-of-6 from three-point range. D'Angelo Russell went just 5-of-15 from the field, but accumulated 15 points, four rebounds and six assists. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams combined for 25 points off the bench.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Indiana Pacers, 111-105, at Verizon Center on Wednesday.

The Wizards (15-16) entered the fourth quarter with a seemingly comfortable 85-74 lead, and extend that edge to 87-74 early in the fourth after a Marcus Thornton layup in the opening minute. However, the Pacers (15-18) refused to go quietly, as they battled back throughout the quarter to eventually close the deficit to 100-98 with 1:54 remaining after a pair of Paul George free throws. That's as close as it would get, though, as Otto Porter drained a clutch three-pointer with 1:39 left, and John Wall, who led all scorers with 36 points, tallied the final six for Washington on a layup and two sets of free throws.

The Pacers were led by George, who nearly matched Wall point for point with 34 points (10-20 FG, 6-10 3Pt), four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Jeff Teague bounced back from one of his poorer shooting nights of the season with a 19-point, 11-assist double-double that also included a pair of rebounds and a steal. Myles Turner compiled 15 points and eight rebounds, along with a trio of blocks. Thaddeus Young filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and a game-high six steals. C.J. Miles provided his typically solid contribution off the bench with 15 points, three rebounds and an assist. 

Wall added 11 rebounds, nine assists and a pair of steals for a spectacular stat line overall. Porter scored 22 points overall, which he supplemented with a rebound. Marcin Gortat stepped up with a 13-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included four assists and a steal. Bradley Beal compiled 12 points, two assists, a rebound and a pair of steals, but he was limited to just 18 minutes due to a sprained right ankle suffered in the contest. Markieff Morris supplied 10 points, seven boards, an assist and a steal.

The Pacers return home for a Friday date with the Chicago Bulls, while the Wizards host the Brooklyn Nets on Friday evening as well.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic, 120-101, at Amway Center on Wednesday. 

While this game was close in the first half, the Hornets stung the Magic in the third quarter to run away with this one. In fact, they outscored Orlando, 35-13 in the third quarter, as the Magic simply couldn't recover from that blow. The Charlotte offense was on point, as they shot 55 percent from the field, 95 percent from the free-throw line and 42 percent from three-point range. Rebounding was also a huge factor, as the Hornets won that battle, 46-34. 

Charlotte (18-14) has thrived in the third quarter all season and they rode that momentum once again here. Nicolas Batum continued his fantastic form, as he accumulated 20 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in the win. Kemba Walker led the team in scoring, as he accrued 21 points, three rebounds and five assists. Ramon Sessions and Jeremy Lamb combined for 27 points and seven rebounds off the bench. On deck for the Hornets is a home matchup against the Miami Heat on Thursday. 

Orlando (15-19) have really struggled at home this season and this tough defeat adds to those deficiencies. Serge Ibaka was the Magic's best player, as he tallied 20 points, seven rebounds and three assists. The issue with that line is the fact that he went scoreless in the second half, going 0-for-4 from the field. The other four starters really struggled, as they combined for 25 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Nikola Vucevic led the team in scoring, as he provided 21 points, six rebounds and four assists on 10-of-13 shooting off the bench. Orlando will be off until Sunday, when they play the Indiana Pacers on the road for their next game.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the New York Knicks, 102-98, in overtime at Phillips Arena on Wednesday.

The game was a grind-it-out defensive battle that nevertheless featured multiple impressive individual performances. Things also got heated between Carmelo Anthony and the Hawks' Thabo Sefolosha, leading to an ejection for the former when he racked up a second flagrant foul on the evening. Despite losing their most pivotal offensive piece, the Knicks (16-15) hung tough, with Derrick Rose (26 points) and Kristaps Porzingis (24 points) helping them to keep pace with the Hawks (16-16). However, Dennis Schroder led all scorers with 27 points and had a key strip of Rose late in overtime, the Knicks' 17th and final turnover of the night, to help carry Atlanta to victory.

Rose added seven assists and six rebounds to his team-high point total, but went only 9-of-28 from the field. Porzingis also had eight boards, an assist, a steal and three blocks, but missed the first of three free throws after getting fouled behind the arc with the Knicks down by only three. He then purposely missed the third shot but New York was unable to take advantage due to his lane violation on the play. Joakim Noah posted an impressive 14-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included three assists, two steals and a block. Anthony compiled 10 points, five boards and an assist before being ejected after 15 minutes on the floor. Justin Holiday paced the bench with 14 points, which he supplemented with four assists, three rebounds, two steals and a block. 

Schroder complemented his aforementioned scoring total with five assists and a pair of steals. Dwight Howard was a force down low with 22 rebounds, along with 16 points, three assists, a steal and a block. Paul Millsap was only 4-of-20 from the field but mustered 12 points, seven rebounds, six assists, two blocks and a steal. Sefolosha and Kent Bazemore provided matching 11-point totals, while Kyle Korver led the second unit with 13 points, five rebounds and an assist.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Detroit Pistons, 119-94, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday.

It's rare to see a road team dominate from start to finish in an NBA game, but that was just the case here. Not only did the Bucks win each individual quarter, they outscored the Pistons by 26 points over the final 29 minutes. Detroit was really let down by their defense, as they allowed Milwaukee to shoot 57 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range. In addition, the Bucks recorded 36 assists, while committing just seven turnovers. 

Milwaukee (15-15) have riden their two youngsters all season and they were special once again here. Jabari Parker was the player of the game, as he scored a game-high 31 points on 13-of-18 shooting. In addition, he added nine rebounds and seven assists to one of his best lines of his career Giannis Antetokounmpo wasn't far behind, as he accumulated 23 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Greg Monroe was the only other player with more than 11 points, as he accrued 14 points, five rebounds and six assists off the bench. Milwaukee will look to keep rolling on Friday in a road matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves. 

Detroit (15-19) has now lost six of their last seven games and losses like this show just how bad their struggling. Tobias Harris did continue his great form off the bench though, as he led the team with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Andre Drummond led the starters in scoring, totaling 16 points and nine rebounds. Reggie Jackson played a season-high 33 minutes and accrued 14 points, three rebounds and six assists.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 101-99, at United Center on Wednesday. 

The normally porous Nets (8-23), they of the lone road victory on the season, didn't give an inch Wednesday, holding the Bulls (16-16) to sub-40 percent tallies from the field and three-point range and eliciting 18 turnovers from their hosts. However, as time wound down, the one player they'd failed to hold down throughout the night, Jimmy Butler, ultimately did them in. His jumper as time expired snapped a 99-99 deadlock and capped off a 40-point effort, while carrying Chicago back to .500 on the season.

Brook Lopez had a remarkable night of his own for the visitors, tallying 33 points, four assists and three rebounds. Sean Kilpatrick was a distant second with 18 points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal. Bojan Bogdanovic went for 10 points, two assists and two rebounds. Trevor Booker mustered a modest six points but hauled in 14 boards and added two assists and a block. Randy Foye led the bench with 11 points, five rebounds, an assist and a steal.

Butler added 11 boards, four assists and four steals to round out his spectacular stat line. Dwyane Wade went for 16 points, four boards and an assist. Robin Lopez turned in 12 points, while Rajon Rondo collected only five points but also supplied 12 assists, nine rebounds and a pair of steals. 

The Nets head to the Nation's Capital to take on the Wizards on Friday evening, while the Bulls visit the Indiana Pacers on Friday night as well.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 102-98, at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday.

Despite the Clippers leading by eight after the first quarter, the Pelicans fought back and took control in the fourth. In fact, New Orleans outscored Los Angeles by 12 in the second half and led for the majority of the fourth quarter. Defense was key for the Pelicans, as they held the Clippers to 39 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. The Pelicans were very efficient on offense too, as they shot 46 percent and committed just six turnovers. Fastbreak points was the most decisive statistic though, as New Orleans won that category, 29-2.  

The Clippers (22-12) got Chris Paul back for this game, but it simply wasn't enough against a hot Pelicans team. Paul played great in his return though, as he tallied 21 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Austin Rivers got the start for J.J. Redick and led the team with 22 points on 9-of-20 shooting. DeAndre Jordan had a monster game down low, totaling 13 points and 25 rebounds on 5-of-6 shooting. The bench really struggled, as Marreese Speights and Jamal Crawford combined to go 7-of-27 from the field. The Clippers will look to get out of this rut on Friday in a road matchup with the Houston Rockets. 

The Pelicans (13-21) have now won four of their last five and this was easily their most impressive win in that stretch. Anthony Davis didn't go off like usual, but he still led the team with 20 points, five rebounds, three steals and two blocks. Jrue Holiday accrued 11 points, four rebounds and nine assists in the win. Buddy Hield had one of his best games of his rookie campaign, collecting 17 points and six rebounds on 7-of-11 shooting. Langston Galloway, Terrence Jones, Tyreke Evans and E'Twaun Moore combined for 43 points off the bench. New Orleans will host the New York Knicks on Friday for their next game.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Phoenix Suns, 119-98, at AT&T Center on Wednesday.

While a Spurs blowout was the expected result, it took a monster second half to get there. In fact, there were six ties and eight lead changes in the first 30-plus minutes, as neither team led by more than 10 points until the final six minutes. San Antonio actually outscored Phoenix, 61-34 in the second half to pull away in their 21-point win. Rebounding was the biggest discrepancy, as the Spurs won that battle, 46-33. They dominated the paint through scoring as well, as San Antonio dropped 64 paint points in their win. 

Phoenix (9-23) did a great job of hanging around in this game, but the Spurs were simply too much to overcome in this lopsided matchup. All the starters struggled, as no one scored more than 13 points or played more than 28 minutes. Marquese Chriss and Eric Bledsoe were the only two starters in double figures, as they scored 13 points a piece. T.J. Warren led the team in scoring, as he accrued 24 points and six rebounds off the bench. Devin Booker had a game to forget, as he went 2-of-13 from the field en route to eight points, three rebounds and four assists. Phoenix will look to play better on Thursday in a home matchup against the Toronto Raptors. 

San Antonio (25-6) didn't play their best in the first half, but they really gave it to the Suns in the second half. Four starters scored in double figures, with Kyle Anderson failing to score in the absence of Kawhi Leonard (sickness). LaMarcus Aldridge continued his fantastic form. as he led the team with 27 points and eight rebounds on 10-of-12 shooting. Tony Parker was second on the team, as he scored 20 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Pau Gasol recorded a double-double, totaling 16 points and 10 rebounds. Manu Ginobili and David Lee scored 12 points a piece off the bench. On deck for the Spurs is a home matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday.

												The host Denver Nuggets squeezed out a win against the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, 105-103.

Denver (14-18) has worked its way into playoff contention, now sitting within half a game of the eighth seed.  On Tuesday, a balanced offensive approach helped guide the team to victory over the young and up-and-coming Timberwolves.  All five starters scored in double digits for Denver, with forward Danilo Gallinari leading the way with 18.  Sophomore Nikola Jokic also impressed, leading the team with 11 assists to go along with 16 points and eight rebounds.  The team made 10 three-pointers, and shot over 51 percent from the field on the night.

Minnesota (10-22), meanwhile, has seen struggles early in the season.  The Timberwolves also saw all five starters score double digits, with their young big three leading the way.  Reigning Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a triple-double, with 15 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.  Guards Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins scored 17 and 25, respectively.  Big man Gorgui Dieng also impressed, scoring 20 points on 9-of-11 shooting.  Minnesota's bench, however, had issues, scoring a combined eight points.

Minnesota will host the Bucks on Friday, while Denver will host the 76ers.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers took down the visiting Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, 102-89, in a battle of eighth-seed contenders.  

Portland (14-20) entered the game having lost six straight, but came away with a convincing win on Wednesday. Despite the absence of injured star Damian Lillard, the Trail Blazers were able to score effectively.  Six Blazers scored in double digits, with C.J. McCollum posting a team-high 20 points.  It was an excellent offensive night for the Blazers, who shot over 47 percent from the field and hit 12 three-pointers.  Surprisingly, though, it was an even better night on the defensive end, a domain in which Portland has struggled all season.  The Blazers managed to hold their opponents to just 39 percent from the field and only nine three-pointers on 32 percent from beyond the arc.  

Sacramento (14-18) saw a tough night on offense, as only center DeMarcus Cousins seemed to be able to find the basket.  Cousins finished with a team-high 28 points and had eight rebounds and six assists.  Only two other players scored in double figures, however, as the team struggled to score.  The Kings also had an off night on the boards, being out-rebounded 45-39 by a generally fairly weak Portland frontcourt.  

On Friday, the Blazers will visit San Antonio, while the Kings will see the Grizzlies on Saturday.

												The host Golden State Warriors took down the visiting Toronto Raptors, 121-111, on Wednesday.

Golden State (28-5) maintains the league's top record, despite leading by only a game and a half over the San Antonio Spurs.  The Warriors have the league's highest-scoring offense, and showed their firepower again against the tough Toronto D.  Three players scored 20 or more for Golden State.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry scored 28 to go with seven rebounds and seven assists.  Former MVP Kevin Durant scored 22 and added a team-high 17 rebounds and seven assists of his own. Klay Thompson scored 21.  The Warriors finished shooting an absurd 57 percent from the field with 33 assists and 51 rebounds.

Despite the Warriors' staggering numbers, the Raptors (22-9) kept the game close until the final minutes after a comeback in the fourth.  Guards Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan each had fantastic games, scoring 27 and 29 respectively.  Wing Terrence Ross came off the bench for 24.  The team shot a poor 38 percent, but was able to remain in the game thanks to tough defensive play.  The Raptors forced 20 turnovers while committing only seven of their own.

The Raptors will visit Phoenix Thursday while Golden State will host Dallas on Friday.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 113-103, at TD Garden on Tuesday.

The Celtics gave the Grizzlies a tough overtime loss less than two weeks ago and they inflicted more pain on them here. Rebounding was the biggest factor for Boston, as they won that battle, 47-37. The Grizzlies were really let down by their shooting, as they went 42 percent from the field, 30 percent from three-point range and 69 percent from the free-throw line. The Celtics did a great job of closing things out at the charity stripe themselves, going 19-of-21 from the free-throw line. Boston actually led for the majority of the game, with the Grizzlies only lead coming in the first quarter. 

Memphis (20-14) had to play this game without Mike Conley (toe) and they simply couldn't overcome his absence. Marc Gasol did all he could to carry the offense though, as he led the team with 26 points, four rebounds, nine assists, two steals and three blocks in a fantastic performance. Zach Randolph recorded a double-double off the bench, totaling 16 points and 10 rebounds. Tony Allen was second on the team with 17 points and eight rebounds on 6-of-9 shooting. Andrew Harrison filled-in for Conley to accrue 12 points, five rebounds and six assists as the starting point guard. Memphis will look to rebound in a home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday for their next matchup.

Boston (19-13) has now handed Memphis two tough losses in the past couple weeks, as they continue to rise up the standings. Avery Bradley was the catalyst in this win, as he led the team with 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Isaiah Thomas wasn't far behind, as he accrued 21 points and seven assists of his own. Jae Crowder had one of his best scoring games of the year, dropping 17 points and seven rebounds. Gerald Green and Marcus Smart were huge off the bench, as Green provided 19 points and five rebounds, while Smart collected 13 points, four rebounds and six assists. On deck for the Celtics is a road matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Miami Heat, 106-94, at America Airlines Arena on Tuesday. 

While Miami got out to an early lead, that was the only one they'd have all game. In fact, the Thunder led for the final 40-plus minutes, as they pulled out a near wire-to-wire win. Rebounding was the biggest factor to the Thunder's success, as they won that battle, 46-32. Fastbreak points and points in the paint were also decisive, as Oklahoma City outscored Miami, 58-32 in the paint and 16-4 in fastbreak points. The Thunder finished the game shooting 51 percent from the field, while holding the Heat to just 44 percent. 

Oklahoma City (20-12) have riden the back of Russell Westbrook all season and he carried the load once again here. Westbrook notched his 15th triple-double of the season, as he accumulated 29 points, 17 rebounds and 11 assists in the win. Steven Adams was the only other starter in double figures, as he totaled 15 points and eight rebounds. Enes Kanter was a nice spark off the bench, providing 19 points and eight rebounds. On deck for the Thunder is a road matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday. 

Miami (10-22) had to play this game without Goran Dragic and it clearly hampered them in this loss. Josh Richardson had been struggling this season, but he was a nice bright spot in this loss, tallying a career-high 22 points, five rebounds and three assists. The Johnson's once again led the bench in scoring, as Josh Johnson accrued 16 points and five rebounds, while Tyler Johnson dropped 15 points, two rebounds and two assists. Hassan Whiteside really struggled, as he went 4-of-11 from the field and committed four turnovers en route to a 12-point and eight-rebound dud. The Heat will look to play better on Thursday in a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The visiting Houston Rockets blew out the host Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, 123-107.  With the win, Houston completed its first sweep of the Mavericks in a season series in 19 years.

The Rockets (24-9) coasted to victory after taking a 19-point lead by the end of the first half. Superstar James Harden led the elite Rockets offense with 34 points and also dished out a team-high 11 assists.  The numbers were far from abnormal for Harden, however, as ""The Beard"" ranks fifth in the NBA in scoring and first in assists.  The Rockets shot over 52 percent from the field, and, unsurprisingly, drained 17 three-pointers.  Under coach Mike D'Antoni, Houston has become the top three-point shooting team in the NBA.  Of course, this is due in part to the arrival of free agents Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.  On Tuesday, Anderson had 22 points with four three-pointers and Gordon scored 13 with two threes.

The Mavericks (9-23) had won three of their previous five contests and looked to be on the rise before Tuesday's beat-down.  Veteran star Dirk Nowitzki recently returned from an Achilles injury, but remains on limited minutes.  On Tuesday, Nowitzki scored seven points and shot just 2-of-8 in 15 minutes.  Forward Harrison Barnes led the team with 21 points, while sharpshooter Wesley Matthews added 19.  As a whole, however, the team shot just 41 percent and struggled to match Houston's staggering scoring pace. 

On Thursday, Dallas will face the Lakers, while the Rockets will rest until Friday when they face the powerhouse Clippers.

												The visiting Utah Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 102-100.

Utah (19-13) snapped a three-game losing streak with Tuesday's win.  The Jazz remain among the NBA's most injury-depleted teams, as guards George Hill, Dante Exum, and Alec Burks were all sidelined for Tuesday's contest.  Forward Derrick Favors, meanwhile, is on a minutes restriction after recently returning from a knee injury.  None of those absences kept Utah from emerging victorious on Tuesday, however.  The Jazz shot over 50 percent from the field and hit nine three-pointers. Star forward Gordon Hayward scored 31 points and pulled down nine rebounds en route to the win.  Center Rudy Gobert, meanwhile, had a team-high 11 rebounds as well as two blocks.

The Lakers (12-23) have had injury issues of their own, but were close to full health on Tuesday.  Los Angeles has seen a monumental slide since beginning the season in the hunt for a playoff seed, as the team is now 2-9 in its last 11 games.  On Tuesday, offense came largely from two players: forward Julius Randle and sixth man Lou Williams.  Randle scored a team-high 25 along with 12 rebounds.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 107-102, at Verizon Center on Monday. 

The Wizards (14-16) have most frequently relied on their dynamic backcourt duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal for offensive production this season, but they aren't the only members of Washington's first unit that has the ability to light up the scoreboard. Otto Porter, Jr. went through a rough stretch on offense earlier in December, but has been coming on as of late, and his resurgence culminated Monday in explosive fashion against the Bucks (14-15). Capitalizing on one of the most generous defenses in the NBA against small forwards, Porter posted a game-high 32 points, while also compiling 13 rebounds, an assist and a block. He was in an impressive zone shooting-wise, going 13-of-18 from the field, a tally that included a 5-of-9 effort from three-point range. Combined with strong efforts from Wall, Beal and Markieff Morris, the Wizards shot 50.6 percent overall, which helped them overcome 16 turnovers. 

The Bucks were led once again by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who managed 22 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists and a block. Tony Snell chipped in with a season-high 20 points, which he supplemented with four rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. Jabari Parker supplied 14 points, six rebounds, four assists and a block. Matthew Dellavedova registered a modest eight points, but dished out 11 dimes, brought in three rebounds and recorded two steals. Greg Monroe led the second unit with 16 points, five rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

Beal checked in second on the Wizards with 22 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Wall put together an 18-point, 16-assist double-double that also included three rebounds, two steals and two blocks. He did, however, commit a game-high seven turnovers. Morris offered 18 points as well, which he complemented with four rebounds, two steals and a block. Marcin Gortat mustered four points but did record 12 rebounds, along with three assists and a block. 

The Bucks hit the road again to face off with the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, while the Wizards remain home to face the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 112-102, at Amway Center on Monday. 

While this scoreline looks moderately close, the Magic had this game well in hand early on. In fact, they led by 25 points at the half in a rare wire-to-wire win, as it took a 30-16 fourth quarter for Memphis to make the scoreline respectable. Orlando's offense was extremely efficient, as they shot 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range, while committing just nine turnovers and 23 assists. Rebounding was also a huge factor, with Orlando winning that battle, 44-35. 

Memphis (20-13) have thrived off their dominant defense all season, but they simply didn't have it tonight. Mike Conley had one of his best games since returning from injury though, as he tallied 17 points, twp rebounds and four assists. The bench was one of the only bright spots, as Zach Randolph, Troy Daniels and James Ennis III all scored in double figures. The Grizzlies will look to play better on Tuesday in a road matchup with the Boston Celtics. 

Orlando (15-18) have really struggled on the offensive end this season, but they had one of their best games here against a stifling Grizzlies defense. Aaron Gordon had one of the best games of his career, as he led the Magic with 30 points on 11-of-15 shooting. Bismack Biyombo recorded a double-double in the win, totaling 10 points and 12 boards in just 23 minutes. Elfrid Payton continued his great form off the bench, as he accumulated 16 points, four rebounds and seven assists. The Magic will look to keep rolling on Wednesday in a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 120-118, at Barclays Center on Monday. 

The 7-22 record the Nets came in to Monday's game with certainly inspired no confidence that they could topple a Hornets squad sporting a solid 17-12 mark, but the one glimmer of hope was the fact that all but one of Brooklyn's victories had come at home. Accordingly, the hosts put on a spectacular offensive display Monday, even after losing starting point guard Jeremy Lin to a hamstring injury in the third quarter. After a back-and-forth tussle for three quarters, the Nets entered the final period on the wrong end of an 88-83 score. However, they battled back to take a 111-105 lead with just 3:04 remaining after a Sean Kilpatrick three-pointer. The Hornets wouldn't go quietly however, and following a Cody Zeller put-back with three seconds left, they were back up on top by a 118-117 margin. That set up a final possession for Brooklyn, one that culminated in a buzzer-beating 25-foot three-pointer from veteran sharpshooter Randy Foye that sealed the victory. Notably, it was Foye's only basket of the evening.

Charlotte was paced by a 24-point effort from Nicolas Batum, which he supplemented with five rebounds, five assists and three steals. Jeremy Lamb followed from the bench with 17 points, four rebounds, an assist and a block. Kemba Walker and  Zeller contributed a pair of 15-point efforts, with the former also supplying six assists, three rebounds and two steals, and the latter adding nine rebounds, two assists and a steal. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist contributed a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two blocks.  Frank Kaminsky was productive in a reserve role as well with 13 points and five rebounds.

The Nets saw Bojan Bogdanovic lead them with 26 points in 27 minutes off the bench, a total he supplemented with four rebounds and two assists. Kilpatrick followed with 23 points, five boards and four assists. His point total consisted of a 9-of-15 tally from the field, including 4-of-7 from three-point range. Brook Lopez supplied 21 points, five, rebounds, five assists and three blocks. Jeremy Lin registered 17 points, four assists and a pair of steals. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson continued to be productive as a reserve with 10 points and four boards. 

The Hornets head down to Central Florida for a Wednesday night with the Orlando Magic, while the Nets visit Chicago on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 106-90, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday. 

The form of these teams would indicate an easy Cleveland win, but once LeBron James was declared inactive, Detroit felt as it was their game to have. They took care of business too, as they pulled out a wire-to-wire win and won each individual quarter by at least three points. Defense was key for the Pistons, as they held the Cavaliers to 38 percent shooting, while forcing 21 turnovers to just 30 made baskets. Three-point shooting really carried Detroit as well, as they went 16-of-28 from long range in their win. 

The Cavaliers (23-7) are coming off a historic win against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday, but it led to LeBron James being rested here and a lackluster performance from the rest of the team. Kyrie Irving led Cleveland in scoring, as he accrued 18 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Kevin Love recorded a double-double, tallying 17 points and 14 rebounds, while committing five turnovers in the defeat. Iman Shumpert, Key Felder and Channing Frye all provided 11 points a piece off the bench. Cleveland will be back to full force on Thursday in their next game against the Boston Celtics. 

The Pistons (15-18) have been in a terrible slide recently and a win over the team like the Cavaliers may be what they need to get going. Tobias Harries was moved to the bench last week and he continues to thrive in that role, as he led the team with 21 points, six rebounds and four assists. Reggie Jackson had one of his best games of the season, as he accumulated 13 points, six rebounds and six assists. Andre Drummond controlled the paint for Detroit, as he totaled 11 points, 17 rebounds and four assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope went 7-of-11 from the field to collect 18 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Detroit's next game is on Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers, 90-85, at United Center on Monday. 

The Bulls (15-16) jumped on their visitors early in a battle of division rivals, building a 28-19 advantage after one quarter. Save for a 20-12 edge by the Pacers (15-17) in the third quarter, Chicago had control of the contest for the most part, despite being outperformed on the offensive end by Indiana. The visitors posted a 42.0 percent success rate from the field and 36.0 percent from three-point range, which was notably superior to the Bulls' respective 38.6 and 24.0 percent tallies. However, a pair of strong efforts from Dwyane Wade and Nikola Mirotic helped carry the Bulls to the hosts to their ninth home victory of the season.

On a night when Jeff Teague significantly struggled with his shot, it was backup point guard Aaron Brooks who led the Pacers off the bench with 19 points, seven assists, four rebounds and a block. Myles Turner was next with 16 points and eight boards, while Paul George turned in 14 points, eight assists, three rebounds and a steal. Thaddeus Young chipped in with 12 points, six boards and a trio of steals. Teague could only muster six points, along with five assists and two rebounds, on 2-of-8 shooting. Al Jefferson posted 11 points, six rebounds and three assists in 20 minutes off the bench. 

Wade's 21 points paced the Bulls, a total he complemented with five assists, three rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Mirotic registered 20 points and seven boards in 30 minutes off the bench. Jimmy Butler filled out the stat sheet with 16 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals. Taj Gibson and Jeremi Grant turned in matching 10-point efforts, and Robin Lopez mustered eight points but hauled in 12 boards, recorded two steals and added a block.

The Pacers continue on their road trip, with their next stop being the Nation's Capital for a Wednesday night tussle with the Washington Wizards. The Bulls remain home to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday evening as well.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 111-104, at Smoothie King Center on Monday.

Despite there being just six ties and four lead changes, this game was close throughout. In fact, neither team led by more than 11 points, as it came down to the final seconds. Both offenses were on point, as the Pelicans shot 53 percent from the field to the Mavericks 49 percent. Transition defense was a big factor for New Orleans, as they won that battle, 7-0. The Pelicans also took care of business on the boards. as they outrebounded Dallas, 41-32. 

Dallas (9-22) has been playing much better recently, but they fell just short here against a talented New Orleans team. Deron Williams continued his recent resurgence, as he led the team with 24 points and nine assists. Seth Curry was the only bench player in double figures, as he accrued 16 points and seven assists. Harrison Barnes collected 15 points and seven boards in the defeat. Wesley Matthews did drop 17 points, but went just 4-of-11 from the field. The Mavericks will play again on Tuesday in a home matchup against the Houston Rockets. 

New Orleans (12-21) has now won three of their last four, albeit against the Sixers, Heat and Mavericks. Anthony Davis was once again the star, as he led the Pelicans with 28 points, 16 rebounds and four assists on 8-of-14 shooting. Jrue Holiday scored just seven points on 2-of-11 shooting, but did hand out 11 assists in the win. Langston Galloway and E'Twaun Moore combined for 33 points on 13-of-18 shooting off the bench. New Orleans will look to keep rolling on Wednesday against a shorthanded Los Angeles Clippers team.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns on Monday, 131-115.

Houston (23-9) has surprised many by holding the third-best record in the Western Conference over a third of the way through the season.  On Monday, the Rockets looked as strong as ever, due in large part to the strong play of superstar James Harden.  Harden predictably took over the game, scoring 32 points and dishing out 12 assists, both team highs.  Sixth man Eric Gordon, meanwhile, continued to be a key part of the Rockets' newfound high-paced offensive attack.  Gordon had 15 points and hit three three-pointers.  As a team, the Rockets had 15 three-pointers and shot an impressive 50 percent from the field.

Phoenix (9-22), on the other hand, sits near the bottom of the Western Conference for the second straight season.  The Suns have won just three of their last eight contests.  On Monday, Phoenix started the game off by accumulating a huge deficit, trailing 39-23 by the end of the first quarter.  Point guard Eric Bledsoe, however, continued to impress, scoring 24 points to go with six rebounds and four assists.

The Rockets will visit Dallas on Tuesday, while the Suns will travel to San Antonio on Wednesday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves beat the visiting Atlanta Hawks on Monday, 104-90.

After a tough Christmas Day loss, Minnesota (10-21) received a confidence boost as it cruised to a win over the Hawks.  The team's young core of Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, and Zach LaVine all impressed on Monday, scoring 22, 21, and 21 respectively.  Towns was particularly potent on offense, as the reigning Rookie of the Year shot a perfect 8-of-8 from the field, including three three-pointers, and 3-of-3 at the free-throw line.  Towns made a big impact on the defensive end as well, recording three blocks.  The team was immensely successful while shooting the ball, as they hit 15 three-pointers on over 48 percent shooting.  Six of those three-pointers came from LaVine, who is having a breakout season and averaging over 20 points per game for the first time in his career.

Atlanta (15-16), meanwhile, has crumbled since its hot 9-2 start to the season.  Once again, the Hawks looked lost on Monday, entering the fourth quarter down by 24 points.  Center Dwight Howard interestingly was also perfect from the field as he scored a team-leading 20 points.  Howard also had 12 rebounds and two steals.  It was not a good overall offensive night for Atlanta, though.  The team shot just 42 percent including 25 percent from three-point range, and had 19 turnovers on the night.  

On Wednesday, the Hawks will host the Knicks and the Wolves will visit the Nuggets in Denver.

												The visiting Toronto Raptors squeaked by the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday, winning 95-91.

Toronto (22-8) holds one of the league's top records, having now won nine of its last 11 games.  On Monday, Toronto saw stellar play from star point guard Kyle Lowry, who led the team with 27 points.  Lowry added seven rebounds and four assists.  Shooting guard DeMar DeRozan, meanwhile, had 20 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists.  The team struggled on offense overall, shooting just 33 percent.  However, the Raptors did have 12 three-pointers and reached the line 24 times in the game.  Five of those threes came off the bench, as forward Patrick Patterson hit 5-of-11 from beyond the arc.

Meanwhile, Portland (13-20) is currently in the midst of the league's biggest slide.  The Blazers hold the last-ranked defense in the NBA and are slowly falling out of the playoff picture in the West.  On Monday, though, it was offensive struggles that did the Blazers in.  With leading scorer Damian Lillard (ankle) out, the team was left struggling to find baskets.  The team shot only 42 percent and hit just eight threes.  The Blazers also committed a whopping 18 turnovers.  However, guard C.J. McCollum impressed with 29 points and seven assists.  

On Wednesday, the Raptors will face the Warriors and the Blazers will take on the Kings.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 106-102, at Staples Center on Monday.

The Clippers (22-11) came in to the game lacking some serious star power, as the starting backcourt of Chris Paul and J.J. Redick both joined Blake Griffin (knee) on the bench Monday night. That pushed ageless veteran Jamal Crawford and capable reserve Austin Rivers into the starting lineup, with both expected to play heavy minutes. That prognosis proved accurate, and the pair of guards turned in 24 and 19 points, respectively. However, the Nuggets (13-18) just had more firepower overall, as the duo of Nikola Jokic and Danilo Gallinari combined for a pair of double-doubles to lead the offensive attack. Gallinari sunk four key free throws in the last 16 seconds of the game to seal the win, Denver's seventh on the road this season.

Jokic's 24-point, 10-rebound double-double led the way for the visitors, and he supplemented those numbers with four assists and three steals. Gallinari added 23 points, along with 11 rebounds, an assist and three steals. Will Barton chipped in off the bench with 23 points of his own, as well as eight boards and six dimes. Gary Harris contributed a modest 10 points, four rebounds and an assist. Kenneth Faried produced eight points, 10 rebounds, an assist and a steal in 19 minutes.

Crawford complemented his aforementioned scoring total with six assists, four rebounds and two steals. Rivers supplied five assists, three rebounds and a steal in addition to his 19-point tally. DeAndre Jordan tallied a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three steals and a block. Brandon Bass and Raymond Felton registered 11 and 10 points, respectively, off the bench. 

The Nuggets head back home to face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday evening, while the Clippers visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night as well.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 102-100, at Golden 1 Center on Monday.

The two clubs nearly matched each other point for point in the first half, with the Kings (14-17) holding a slim 51-47 edge at halftime. However, the Sixers (7-23) stormed out of intermission to take the third quarter by a 30-19 margin, leaving them with a seven-point lead heading into the final period. Sacramento then turned the tables in the fourth, and DeMarcus Cousins made sure the visitors didn't prevail. First, the mercurial big man sunk a 26-foot three-point jumper with 20 seconds left to give the Kings a 99-97 lead. He subsequently netted one of two free throws with five seconds remaining to extend the advantage to three, and then stuffed a 25-foot shot attempt by the Sixers' Joel Embiid with three ticks on the clock. Embiid managed to get his hands on the ball again in time to hoist a 28-footer a second later, but the home team was assured the win when that shot failed to find the net. 

Despite the failed heroics, Philadelphia's emerging big man did pace them with 25 points, eight rebounds, an assist, two steals and two blocks. Sergio Rodriguez followed with 18 points, five assists, three rebounds and a trio of steals. The remaining three members of the first unit failed to hit double digits in the scoring column, however, as Jahlil Okafor (six points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal), Gerald Henderson (six points, two rebounds and an assist) and Robert Covington (five points, six rebounds, an assist, two steals and two blocks) under-performed on offense. However, the scoring void was partly made up by two big men off the bench, as Ersan Ilyasova and Dario Saric went for 17 and 12 points, respectively.

Cousins led the way for the home squad with 30 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and two blocks. Rudy Gay went for a near double-double with 17 points, nine boards, two assists and a block. Ty Lawson compiled 12 points off the bench, a total he supplemented with four rebounds, four assists and two steals. Darren Collison produced nine points, four assists, a rebound and a steal, but Ben McLemore and Kosta Koufos could only supply a combined 10 points.

The Sixers next visit the Utah Jazz on Thursday evening, while the Kings travel to Portland to face off with the Blazers on Wednesday night.

												The visiting Boston Celtics took down the New York Knicks, 119-114, in a classic Christmas rivalry matchup at Madison Square Garden. 

Boston (18-13) has heated up since the return of star point guard Isaiah Thomas, and is now 5-1 in its last six games.  The Celtics are now 12-7 on the road, having won more road games than any other team in the Eastern Conference.  On Sunday, the Celtics staved off a late comeback effort from the Knicks.  With the game tied and under a minute to go, guard Marcus Smart hit a clutch three-pointer from the corner to take the lead.  Smart had a terrific game off the bench, scoring 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting and dishing out seven assists.  Boston doubled down on the defensive end, with a clutch steal from shooting guard Avery Bradley and a game-ending block from All-Star center Al Horford.  Horford finished with 15 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals, and two blocks.  Thomas, the Celtics' leader in scoring average, led the team once again with 27 points.

New York (16-14), meanwhile, made a valiant comeback in the last three minutes of the game.  The Knicks went on a 16-3 run to tie the game after trailing by double digits.  Much of the comeback was due to the play of star forward Carmelo Anthony, who had 22 points in the second half.  Despite the clutch play, Melo ended up committing a costly crunch-time turnover when switched onto Avery Bradley.  Sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis had 22 points and 12 rebounds, while point guard Derrick Rose contributed 25.

The Cavs will visit Detroit on Monday, while Golden State will host Toronto on Wednesday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors, 109-108, at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday. 

The Cleveland-Golden State matchup is always one of the showcase games of the year and that ended up being the case in this Christmas Day classic. Despite Golden State leading for well over 40 minutes of this game, it was tight throughout, as they never led by more than 14 points, with 11 ties in total. Cleveland made the final, most important push though, as they overcame a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win by one. Both defenses did a great job, as the Warriors were held to a 25-19, assist-to-turnover ratio and 31 percent shooting from three-point range, while the Cavaliers were held to 39 percent shooting from the field. Offensive rebounding was the big difference for the Cavaliers, as they won that battle, 18-5. 

Golden State (27-5) has been spectacular all season, but a loss to their arch enemy is the last thing they wanted on Christmas. Kevin Durant showed why the Warriors wanted to acquire him though, as he scored a game-high 36 points, while also adding 15 rebounds in the defeat. Klay Thompson was second on the team, as he scored 24 points on 9-of-16 shooting. Draymond Green did commit six turnovers, but he accumulated 16 points, four rebounds and four assists on 7-of-9 shooting. Stephen Curry added to his Christmas Day struggles, as he totaled 15 points and three assists on 4-of-11 from the field, The Warriors next game won't be until Wednesday, when they host the Toronto Raptors. 

Cleveland (23-6) had a tough task here against one of the best offenses ever, but they put on a show in the game of the season. Kyrie Irving was the hero, as he hit the game-winning jumper from 15-feet out with three seconds left. He finished the game with 25 points, 10 assists and seven steals in a fantastic performance. LeBron James may have been even better though, as he accrued 31 points, 13 rebounds and four assists of his own. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier with more than 10 points, as he collected 20 points and six rebounds. Cleveland returns to action on Monday in a road matchup with the Detroit Pistons.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Chicago Bulls, 119-100, at AT&T Center on Sunday. 

San Antonio has been dominant at home over recent seasons and they were great once again in this Christmas Day showdown. They got out to a near perfect start, as they led 30-10 across the first eight minutes, while going 12-of-13 from the field. Chicago actually crawled back into the game to take their first and only lead in the third quarter, but San Antonio responded with a 12-0 run to recapture a double-digit lead. The Spurs offense was on point all day, as they hit 57 percent of their two's and 50 percent from three-point range. In addition, San Antonio dished out 30 assists on 48 made baskets, while committing just 13 turnovers.  

Chicago (14-16) has been in a terrible slide over recent weeks, but they did a good job to fight back in a game that looked to be a blowout early on. Dwyane Wade continued his Christmas Day success, as he led the team with 24 points, three rebounds and six assists. Jimmy Butler really struggled, as he went 8-of-19 from the field to collect 19 points, five rebounds and three assists. Chicago will have to play again on Monday, as they host the Indiana Pacers.

San Antonio (24-6) is playing some great ball right now and a near wire-to-wire win on Christmas Day is all fans could ask for. LaMarcus Aldridge added to his fantastic stretch, as he scored a game-high 33 points on 15-of-20 shooting, while also snatching down nine rebounds. Kawhi Leonard was equally as good, accumulating 25 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three steals of his own.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 112-100, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday.

In the extended absence of Victor Oladipo (wrist), the Thunder (19-12) have naturally depended heavily on perennial All-Star Russell Westbrook, and he's validated their faith on countless occasions. However, others in the OKC supporting cast have occasionally stepped up to lessen the load on the dynamic point guard, and such was the case on Christmas Day. It was the Thunder's pair of big men, Steven Adams and Enes Kanter, who turned in 22 and 20 points, respectively, to supplement a game-high 31 points from Westbrook, who also provided 15 assists, seven rebounds, a steal and a block. That trio of efforts helped lead to a 51.2 percent success rate from the field for the Thunder, which helped offset their 15 turnovers.

The Timberwolves (9-21) were led by Karl-Anthony Towns, who supplied 26 points and eight rebounds. Andrew Wiggins was right behind him with 23 points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals. Zach LaVine, coming off a 40-point explosion against the Sacramento Kings on Friday night, was relatively quiet with 16 points, which he supplemented with two assists, a rebound and a steal. Ricky Rubio was only able to muster three points, but he did hand out 10 assists, haul in seven boards and record a pair of steals. Shabazz Muhammad paced the second unit with 15 points.

Adams added six rebounds, an assist and two steals to his aforementioned scoring total. Kanter registered four rebounds, four assists and a steal in addition to his 20 points. The starting five outside of Westbrook and Adams provided precious little on the scoreboard, as Andre Roberson, Domantas Sabonis and Anthony Morrow combined for just nine points. Alex Abrines tallied 10 points over 21 minutes in a reserve role. 

The Timberwolves head back home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night, while the Thunder head down to South Florida to tangle with the Miami Heat on Tuesday evening.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 111-102, at Staples Center on Sunday.

The two intra-city rivals met for the first time this season, and the reeling Lakers (12-22) caught the Clippers (22-10) in a somewhat weakened state. The visitors checked in to the Christmas Day showdown without Chris Paul (hamstring), who missed his second straight game, and Blake Griffin, who is in for a multi-week absence due to his recent knee surgery. The hosts benefited from a balanced effort from their first unit, as all five players , and two reserves, hit double digits in the scoring column. The offensive proficiency led to a 47.6 percent success rate from the field, and their defense managed to elicit 15 turnovers from the Clippers. 

The Clippers were co-led by a pair of 22-point efforts from J.J. Redick and Jamal Crawford, with the former adding three assists, two rebounds and a steal, and the latter recording three assists and a steal as well. Raymond Felton drew another start in Paul's place and supplied eight points, 10 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. DeAndre Jordan mustered a modest seven points but did bring down 10 boards as well, while also dishing out six assists. Mareese Speights was productive in a reserve role as well, posting 15 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal.

Timofey Mozgov and Nick Young paced the Lakers with matching 19-point tallies. Mozgov added three rebounds, while Young added two rebounds, two assists and a steal. D'Angelo Russell went for 14 points, five boards and four assists. Luol Deng continued his offensive resurgence, managing a 13-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included two assists, two steals and two blocks. Julius Randle matched Deng's point total and supplemented it with eight assists, seven rebounds and two steals. Lou Williams paced the second unit with 14 points, three rebounds, an assist, a block and a steal. Brandon Ingram came off the bench to supply 10 points and six boards over 28 minutes.

The Clippers head back home to face off with the Denver Nuggets on Monday night, while the Lakers remain home to face off with the Utah Jazz on Tuesday evening.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Chicago Bulls, 103-91, at Spectrum Center on Friday night.

The Bulls (14-15) checked in to Friday night on a downturn, as they'd lost four of their last five. They were able to get off to a fast start ,however, outscoring the host Hornets (17-13) by a 26-22 margin in the first quarter. Charlotte turned the table quickly in the second period, however, almost doubling up the visitors with a 26-14 advantage. Although the Bulls bounced back in the third, the Hornets were able to keep pace every step of the way throughout the second half, which resulted in their tenth home win of the season. While Chicago failed to find much scoring from their starting five outside of Jimmy Butler, Charlotte benefited from a balanced effort across their first unit. As customary, the effective backcourt duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum led the way, as they supplied matching 20-point contributions. 

Butler's 24 points led the Bulls, a total he supplemented with four rebounds, four assists and a block. Dwyane Wade was second, registering 12 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Taj Gibson supplied 10 points, three rebounds and a pair of blocks. Rajon Rondo mustered a modest seven points but also provided 10 assists, nine rebounds and two steals. Doug McDermott led the second unit with 15 points, while Nikola Mirotic managed an 11-point, 10-rebound double that also included a steal and a block in just 19 minutes off the bench.

Walker added five rebounds, four assists and a steal to his co-leading point total, while Batum's performance was a triple-double that also consisted of 11 rebounds, 10 assists, a steal and a block. Cody Zeller went for 13 points, seven rebounds, four assists, two blocks and a steal. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had a near double-double with 12 points, nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and four blocks. Frank Kaminsky III paced the bench with 13 points, five boards, an assist and a block. 

The Bulls are in San Antonio on Christmas Day to take on the Spurs, while the Hornets visit the Brooklyn Nets on Monday evening.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 109-90, at Amway Center on Friday. 

The Magic wanted to get out to a hot start here and that carried them to an important wire-to-wire win. In fact, Orlando won the first quarter, 30-14 and recorded a franchise-record nine blocks in that 12-minute period. Shooting was the difference in the game, with the Lakers hitting just 36 percent of their shots to the Magic's 51 percent from the field. Los Angeles really struggled with their ball movement, as they matched their 16 assists with 16 turnovers, while Orlando recorded 25 assists to 14 turnovers. 

Los Angeles (11-22) has now lost 11 of their last 12 games, as they continue to fall down the standings. Every player on the roster struggled, as no on who took more than five shots could hit over 50 percent from the field. Jordan Clarkson led the team in scoring, as he tallied 18 points, five rebounds and two assists on 7-of-14 shooting off the bench. D'Angelo Russell led the starters in scoring, totaling 15 points, two rebounds, three assists and two steals in the defeat. Luol Deng recorded an 11-point, 11-rebound double-double. Thomas Robinson was the only player to shoot above 50 percent, as he amassed seven points and 11 rebounds on 3-of-5 shooting. The Lakers will look to get out of this slide in a rivalry game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. 

Orlando (14-18) have struggled this season, but wire-to-wire wins like this show their true potential. Serge Ibaka continues to emerge, as he led the starters with 19 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks in the victory. Elfrid Payton was their most valuable player though, as he accumulated 25 points, three rebounds and nine assists on 11-of-16 shooting off the bench. C.J. Watson, D.J. Augustin and Nikola Vucevic all scored 11 points a piece. Orlando is off until Monday, when they host the Memphis Grizzlies for their next fixture.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers notched their third straight win as they rolled over the visiting Brooklyn Nets 119-99, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday evening. 

The Cavs (22-6) dominated the first three quarters, leading 98-57 heading into the fourth. The Nets (7-22) managed to pour in 42 points in the fourth but it was too little, too late. Both teams shot below 30 percent from long range, while the Cavs outscored the Nets 60-48 in the paint.

LeBron James was the high-point man for Cleveland, with 19 points, along with six assists, five rebounds and three steals, in 27 minutes. Six other players scored in double digits for the Cavs, including Tristan Thompson, who finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Kyrie Irving also reached a double-double with 13 points and 10 assists, along with five rebounds and an amazing six steals. The Cavs are now 15-2 at home this season, but will have that record tested as they play host to the Warriors on Christmas day. 

Five players scored in double figures for the Nets, led by Brook Lopez, who finished with 16 points. Spencer Dinwiddie followed up with 13 points, along with three assists and three rebounds. Jeremy Lin added 10 points, six assists and two rebounds, in his third game back in the starting lineup after returning from injury.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Boston Celtics, 117-112, at TD Garden on Friday.

The Celtics (17-13) have been at their best on the road this season, carrying just a 6-5 home record into Friday night's tilt. Despite a game effort, their struggles continued Friday, as Russell Westbrook's 45-point, 11-rebound, 11-assist triple-double led the way for the Thunder (18-12). The dynamic point guard went to the line a game-high 16 times, converting 14 of those opportunities into points. Overall, Oklahoma City had the hot hand shooting-wise, posting success rates of 51.3 and 42.3 percent, respectively, from the field and three-point range. The Celtics couldn't quite keep up late, despite standout efforts from Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford.

Domantas Sabonis was a surprising second on the Thunder in scoring with a career-high 20 points, which he supplemented with a rebound, an assist and a steal. Steven Adams supplied a modest eight points but did haul in 11 boards, while also recording three assists, two steals and a block. Andre Roberson managed five points, five rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Enes Kanter was an invaluable source of scoring off the bench with 20 points, six boards and two assists. 

Thomas' 34 points led the Celtics, a total he complemented with 10 assists, two rebounds and a steal. Horford was next with 23 points, six rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block. Amir Johnson posted 17 points, six rebounds, five assists and two steals, supplying back-to-back double-digit scoring performances for the first time this season. Avery Bradley registered 16 points, six boards and an assist. 

The Thunder return home to face off with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Christmas Night, while the Celtics head to the Big Apple to take on the Knicks for a Christmas Day showdown.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Detroit Pistons, 119-113, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Friday.

While the Pistons have struggled mightily recently, they fought as hard as they could against the best team in the league. The Warriors were able to prevail though, as there were 10 ties and 18 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than eight points. Both of these offenses were on point in this close-fought battle, as they both shot over 50 percent from the field. Golden State's efficiency was one of the biggest factors, as they recorded 35 assists on 56 percent shooting to Detroit's' 22 dimes on 51 percent. Free-throw shooting also killed the Pistons, as they shot 61 percent (17-of-28), while the Warriors shot 92 percent (22-of-24). 

Golden State (27-4) had a tough task here in a back-to-back set, but they pulled out another huge win on the road. Kevin Durant continued his amazing season, as he tallied 32 points, eight rebounds and three assists on 13-of-18 shooting. Stephen Curry was second on the team, as he finished with 25 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Draymond Green went just 1-of-8 from the field to score five points, but still provided 10 rebounds and 12 assists in his homecoming game. On deck for the Warriors is their game of the season, as they play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Christmas. 

While this adds to Detroit's (14-18) recent five-game slide, this is not a loss to be discouraged by. Tobias Harris was shifted to the bench for this game and had his best performance of the season, as he accrued 26 points and seven rebounds in the defeat. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the starters in scoring, as he dropped 25 points. Andre Drummond fell a rebound shy of a double-double, totaling 15 points and nine rebounds on 6-of-7 shooting, Reggie Jackson accumulated 17 points, three rebounds and six assists as the starting point guard. Detroit is off until Monday, when they also host the Cleveland Cavaliers for their next game.

												The Milwaukee Bucks snapped a two-game losing streak as they stomped over the visiting Washington Wizards 123-96, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday evening, 

Washington came into this game winners of six of their last eight games, while Milwaukee came in as losers of five of their last seven, however judging by the final score one might have assumed that each team was on the opposite trend, as the struggling Bucks rolled over the surging Wizards. 

The Bucks (14-14) dominated from the start, taking a 37-29 lead after the first quarter. They went on to win the next three quarters, while Giannis Antetokounmpo had his way with a career-high 39 points, along with eight rebounds, six assists and two steals, in 33 minutes. Jabari Parker followed up with 21 points, while Malcolm Brogdon added 17, in 29 minutes off the bench. The Bucks shot a blistering 56 percent from the field and owned the paint, where they outscored the Wizards 66-46. The Bucks are now 10-7 at home, while their next contest comes on Boxing Day, when they visit Washington, for the second game of a home-and-home series. 

The Wizards (13-16) shot 46.8 percent from the field and 29 percent from long range, but were not able to slow the stampeding Bucks. Four players scored in double digits for Washington, led by John Wall and Otto Porter Jr., who tallied 18 each. Markieff Morris chipped in 14 points, while Bradley Beal added 10, on 3-10 shooting from the field. The Wizards are now 3-10 on the road. Their next contest takes place on Boxing Day, when they play host to the Bucks.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Houston Rockets, 115-109, at FedEx Forum on Friday.

The Grizzlies (20-12) hold a reputation as one of the true grinding, defensive-minded squads in the NBA, and rightfully so. They checked in to Friday's showdown with the high-octane Rockets (22-9) second only to the Jazz in points allowed per game (96.9), while holding opponents to a 42.7 percent success rate from the field that also ranked them as second-best behind Utah. However, Memphis flashed the ability to give the scoreboard operator a workout Friday, as they broke out for a season-high 115 points to secure their 12th home victory of the season. Mike Conley, recently recovered from a serious back injury, led the way with 24 points, and the Grizzlies impressively shot 50.6 percent from the field and 52.0 percent from three-point range. On the defensive end, they were able to contain the prolific Rockets to 42.7 percent and 38.5 percent success rates, respectively.

Houston was led by Ryan Anderson's season-high 31 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds and two blocks. James Harden provided a modest 16 points while only taking 13 shot attempts, but served as a master facilitator, handing out 17 dimes. He also recorded seven rebounds and a steal, but turned the ball over a game-high nine times. Montrezl Harrell compiled 16 points and provided eight rebounds and an assist while drawing another start center. Patrick Beverley went for 13 points, six rebounds, an assist and two steals. Eric Gordon got his money's worth out of his 32 minutes on the floor, posting 17 points, four assists, two rebounds, a steal and a block while taking a whopping 16 of his 19 shot attempts fro three-point range. 

Conley complemented his aforementioned team-high scoring total with five assists, three rebounds and a steal. Marc Gasol was next with 16 points, five rebounds, four assists, two blocks and a steal. Tony Allen filled out the stat sheet with nine points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Chandler Parsons played a scant 15 minutes as he continues to build up his conditioning following a long absence, and he managed four points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal.

												The Toronto Raptors took down the host Utah Jazz on Friday, 104-98.

The Raptors (21-8) are in second place in the East and have been separating from the lower seeds in recent weeks.  On Friday, the team squeezed out a narrow win against the Jazz thanks to a strong fourth quarter push.  The Raptors trailed by two points heading into the fourth but outscored the Jazz 32-24 in the quarter.  Toronto was led by star point guard Kyle Lowry, who scored 36 points on 15-of-20 shooting.  The lights-out Lowry was complemented by 24 from shooting guard DeMar DeRozan.  'The Quadruple Capital' added six rebounds and four steals on the defensive end.

The Jazz (18-13) appear to be in a bit of a slump, having now lost three straight games.  The team lost its second straight on a fourth quarter collapse, as the team once again led heading into the game's final quarter.  Center Rudy Gobert once again played strong basketball, scoring 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting and pulling down 14 rebounds.  Forward Gordon Hayward led the team with 23 points and also had five assists.  

Both teams will break until after Christmas.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the visiting Philadelphia 76ers on Friday, 123-116.

Phoenix (9-21) saw strong guard play en route to the win.  Sophomore Devin Booker had four threes and scored 23 points to go along with six rebounds and six assists.  Meanwhile, starting point guard Eric Bledsoe led the team with 24 points.  Bledsoe, who has caught fire in the month of December, also dished a whopping 11 assists.  One of the keys to victory for the Suns was a strong effort on the glass, as the team managed to hold a 43-28 rebounding advantage by the game's end.

Philadelphia (7-22) reclaimed the title of worst team in the league with the loss, but saw promising play from its young rising stars.  Most notably, Rookie of the Year front-runner Joel Embiid absolutely dominated Phoenix's frontcourt.  Embiid had 27 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in just 28 minutes of play.  Embiid is playing on a minutes restriction after injuries robbed him of two consecutive seasons.  However, he has made the most of limited minutes and delivered one of his best nights of the season on Friday.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs demolished the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, 110-90.

The Spurs (24-6) bounced back from a loss to the Clippers on Thursday with a crushing defeat of the Blazers on Friday.  San Antonio advanced to 16-2 on the road, remaining the league's best road team.  On Friday, star forward Kawhi Leonard led the way with 33 points on incredible efficiency.  Leonard shot 9-of-15 including 5-of-7 from three and made all ten of his free-throw attempts. Forward LaMarcus Aldridge upped his production in the absence of big man Pau Gasol (rest), dropping 18 points, 14 rebounds, and six assists.  Bench guard Patty Mills also added 23.

Portland (13-19) is in the midst of a midseason crisis, as the team has now gone just 1-9 in its last ten games.  The Blazers' defense currently ranks as the worst of any team in this decade, and it showed on Friday.  Portland allowed the Spurs to shoot a scorching 50 percent from the field and 60 percent from beyond the arc.  The team also saw underwhelming offensive production, as star guards Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum scored only 16 points each.  

The Spurs will play host to the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day.

												The visiting Dallas Mavericks upset the powerhouse Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, 90-88.

Dallas (9-21) has now won four of its last seven games after a horrendous start to the season that had seated them at last in the Western Conference.  On Friday, the team saw the return of star forward Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles).  Despite only playing 15 minutes, Nowitzki was a difference-maker for the Mavs, scoring 17 points on 7-of-12 shooting.  Forward Harrison Barnes, meanwhile, led the team with 24 points.  The Mavericks played tough defense, forcing 20 Clippers turnovers on the night.

Los Angeles (22-9) defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a major win on Thursday, but saw a fourth quarter collapse against the Mavericks.  Despite leading by as much as eight early in the fourth, the Clippers walked away with a loss at the end of the day.  LA is missing star forward Blake Griffin, who recently underwent surgery and is expected to be sidelined until mid-January.  Griffin's absence was felt, as the Clippers' starting five combined for just 34 points.  Sixth man Jamal Crawford led the team with 26 off the bench.

The Clippers will play the Lakers on Christmas Day.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Indiana Pacers, 109-102, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Thursday.

The Pacers (15-16) got off to a quick start, outscoring the Celtics (17-12) by a 31-22 margin in the first quarter. However, Boston came roaring back in the second period, which helped propel them to the eventual mark. They blasted their hosts 29-9 leading into halftime, building a lead that they'd sustain the rest of the way. As has become the norm, it was Isaiah Thomas who led the way for the visitors, tallying 28 points, nine assists and a rebound. That helped offset a standout effort by the point guard opposite him, as Jeff Teague posted a game-high 31 points for Indiana. 

Jae Crowder supplied 15 points, five rebounds, two assists and a steal. Avery Bradley matched his point total and added six rebounds and three steals. Amir Johnson made some surprising offensive contributions, registering 11 points, six rebounds, an assist and a steal. Al Horford mustered a modest eight points but did haul in 11 boards. Marcus Smart (12 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block) and Kelly Olynyk (11 points, five rebounds, two assists and a steal) were productive off the bench.

Teague added eight assists, five rebounds and a block to his aforementioned scoring haul. Paul George followed with 19 points, eight boards, five assists and a pair of steals. Thaddeus Young stepped up with a 15-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included four assists and a steal. Myles Turner poured in 10 points and supplemented them with eight rebounds and a block. C.J. Miles led the bench with 19 points, along with two rebounds and a block.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 117-101, at Barclays Center on Thursday.

The Warriors (26-4) have a reputation for being just slightly less prolific on the road, but they had no trouble generating offense against the lowest-ranked defensive unit in the league Thursday, even without Draymond Green, who missed the contest for the birth of his child. Kevin Durant led the way with a near double-double consisting of 26 points and nine rebounds, and he added seven assists and three steals. The Golden State defense was the other star on the night, as they elicited 26 turnovers from the Nets, while only committing 12 of their own.

Klay Thompson was second with 23 points, five rebounds, two assists and four steals. Stephen Curry had one of his poorer shooting nights, going for only 15 points (6-19 FG, 3-13 3Pt) and adding seven assists, two rebounds and five steals. Zaza Pachulia was particularly productive, supplying 15 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and a block. David West led the bench with 10 points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks.

The Nets (7-21) were paced by Brook Lopez, who registered 28 points, eight boards, two assists and two blocks. Sean Kilpatrick totaled 14 points, four boards and two assists. Bojan Bogdanovic was next with 12 points and three boards. Jeremy Lin put together a 10-point, 11-assist double-double that also included two steals and two blocks. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson collected 13 points, six rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block while leading the second unit.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Orlando Magic, 106-95, at Madison Square Garden on Thursday. 

While this scoreline appears to be close, the Knicks were in control for the majority of this game. In fact, Orlando had just one lead in the first quarter and trailed every other minute, Rebounding was a huge beneficiary for the Knicks, as they won that battle, 52-41. In addition, three-point shooting was a key difference as well, with New York going 9-of-20 and Orlando hitting just 5-of-27 from long distance. New York's bench really carried the load, as they outscored the Magic's bench, 44-34.

Orlando (13-18) continues to struggle on offense and a 95-point effort against the Knicks is another poor showing. Serge Ibaka was the Magic's best player, as he tallied 23 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double-double. Evan Fournier was the only other starter in double figures, as he accumulated 21 points, five rebounds and four assists. Elfrid Payton, Jeff Green and Nikola Vucevic each scored 10 points a piece off the bench. On deck for Orlando is a home matchup against the Los Angels Lakers on Friday. 

New York (16-13) got some great bench performances here, as that was the difference in the game.

Even though Miami trailed by 19 at times in the second quarter, they rallied to pull out a much needed win. The third and fourth quarters is when Miami did their damage, as they outscored Los Angeles. 62-47 in that stretch. The Heat's offense was efficient as ever, as they shot 54 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range. Rebounding and assists were lopsided as well, as Miami won the rebounding, 47-40 and the assist differential, 25-18. The Heat's first lead did not come until there was a minute left in the third quarter. 

Los Angeles (11-21) is in their worst stretch of the season right now and they continue to falter against bad teams. Lou Williams was once again the best player for the Lakers, as he dropped 27 points off the bench. Nick Young led the starters in scoring, as he scored 20 points on 7-of-14 shooting. D'Angelo Russell had his bets game in weeks, accumulating 17 points, four rebounds and seven assists. On deck for Los Angeles is a road matchup against the Orlando Magic on Friday. 

Miami (10-20) have been playing better than results would show, so a win here is just what the doctor ordered. Justise Winslow was the Heat's most valuable player, as he accrued 23 points, 13 rebounds and four steals in 42 minutes of action. Hassan Whiteside matched Winslow, as he provided 23 points and 13 rebounds of his own. Goran Dragic was the only other starter in double figures, as he collected 21 points and seven assists.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the San Antonio Spurs 106-101 at Staples Center on Thursday. 

The Clippers (22-8) snapped the Spurs (23-6) five game winning streak, even without Blake Griffin (knee) and Chris Paul (hamstring). Paul left towards the end of the third quarter and was questionable to return, leaving the reigns to Raymond Felton. Los Angeles maintained a steady lead throughout most of the second half, picking apart a weak defensive effort, save from that of Kawhi Leoanrd. The Clippers leaned on a handful of reserve players like Austin Rivers, Felton and Jamal Crawford to come away with the edgy victory. Aside from a minor lapse during the waning seconds of the fourth quarter, the score finished far closer than most of the game showed. 

Before leaving, Paul scored scored 19 points, to go along with seven rebounds, six assists, and two steals across 24 minutes. Marreese Speights and Felton combined for 27 points off the bench, and the Warriors implant pretty much closed out the game for Los Angeles with a three-pointer that salvaged a 0-of-5 effort up to that point late in the fourth quarter. Kawhi Leonard added another strong performance to his already impressive first half of the season. The Spurs forward scored 27 points, grabbed nine rebounds and dished out five assists on 8-of-19 shooting. San Antonio went seven players deep on the bench, led by Jonathon Simmons eight points and five rebounds across 22 minutes. 

Both teams play the second game of a back-to-back on Friday, as the Spurs visit the Portland Trail Blazers, while the Clippers host the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 113-102, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday.

The two teams met for the second straight night after going into overtime yesterday, but LeBron James and Kyrie Irving showed little sign of fatigue. With Kevin Love out once again with a knee injury, the Big Two stepped up in his stead, tallying 29 and 31 points, respectively. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker did a pretty good job going blow for blow with the All-Star duo, but received precious little support from anyone else on the Bucks (13-14). Meanwhile, the Cavs (21-6) were just a bit better with their shot, as they managed success rates of 49.4 and 55.6 percent, respectively, from the field and three-point range. 

Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee with 28 points, five rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Parker was right behind him with 27 points, two assists, a rebound and a block. However, John Henson (four points, eight rebounds, an assist and two blocks), Tony Snell (three points, one rebound, one assist) and Matthew Dellavedova (two points, three assists, two rebounds, two steals) significantly underwhelmed on the offensive end. In fact, the only other double-digit scorer for the vistors came from the bench, as rookie Malcolm Brogdon went for 11 points, seven assists, five rebounds and three steals. 

Irving added a career-high 13 assists, six rebounds and a steal to his game-high scoring total. James complemented his points with nine rebounds and six assists. Richard Jefferson drew another start in Love's place and supplied 10 points, four assists and a block. Tristan Thompson turned in just five points but hauled in 15 rebounds. Iman Shumpert and Channing Frye paced the second unit with a pair of 10-point efforts.

The Bucks head back home to face off with the Washington Wizards on Friday evening, while the Cavs remain home to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Friday evening as well.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 92-84, at Phillips Arena on Wednesday.

Gorgui Dieng had a near double-double with 12 points, nine boards, an assist, three blocks and a steal. Ricky Rubio went for 10 points, eight assists, five rebounds and a pair of steals. 

Dennis Schroder led an Atlanta squad that endured a sluggish night on the offensive end, compiling 21 points, seven assists and a rebound. Paul Millsap put together an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included seven assists and two steals. Kyle Korver went for 10 points, five rebounds, three assists and four blocks.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Detroit Pistons, 98-86, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday.

These are two defensive-minded teams and that showed with both of these offense struggling mightily in this matchup. Detroit was especially bad, as they shot 36 percent from the field and 26 percent from three-point range. The key for Memphis was the assist-to-turnover ratio, as they recorded 25 assists to just eight turnovers, while the Pistons committed 17 turnovers to just 17 assists. This was a near wire-to-wire win for the Grizzlies, as the Pistons never tied or led after the first quarter. 

Memphis (18-13) came into this game losing four of their last five, so a road win is just what the doctor ordered. Marc Gasol was easily the player of the game, as he tallied 38 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks on 14-of-17 shooting. In fact, Gasol was the only Memphis player to score more than 10 points, as they had eight players score between five and 10 points. JaMychal Green was the only other player in double figures, as he amassed 10 points and nine rebounds in the win. Andrew Harrison and Mike Conley played all the point guard minutes and combined for 18 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. On deck for Memphis is a home matchup against the Houston Rockets on Friday. 

Detroit (14-17) is in the midst of their worst stretch of the season and this marks their fourth-straight loss by at least 12 points. Reggie Jackson left in the first three minutes due to a leg injury, but returned to drop a team-high 18 points and seven assists in the defeat. Jon Leuer matched that 18-point total, as he added six rebounds off the bench. Andre Drummond recorded a double-double, totaling 13 points and 19 rebounds. Marcus Morris did score 12 points and grab five rebounds, but went just 1-of-11 from the field. Detroit will look to get out of this slide on Friday in a tough matchup against the Golden State Warriors.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 107-97, at United Center on Wednesday.

These are two teams going in opposite directions and this result shows just which way. This game was close throughout though, as there were 11 ties and 17 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 13 points. The fourth quarter is when things really separated, with Washington winning that quarter, 30-20. The shooting was the glaring difference, as the Wizards shot 52 percent from the field, while the Bulls barely cracked 40 percent. In addition, Chicago went just 3-of-18 from three-point range and 18-of-25 from the free-throw line. Fastbreak points was the only other big differential, with Washington doubling up Chicago, 32-16 in that category.

Washington (13-15) have now won six of their last eight games and road wins against a tough team like the Bulls shows their recent progression. John Wall was once again the catalyst, as he tallied 23 points, six rebounds, nine assists and three steals. Bradley Beal wasn't far behind, as he accrued 21 points, five assists and two steals. Marcin Gortat recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points and 11 rebounds. Otto Porter played just 12 minutes, as he left with back spasms in the second quarter. The Wizards will look to keep rolling on Friday in a road matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks. 

Chicago (14-14) has now lost seven of their last 10 games and home losses against teams like the Wizards simply won't get it done. Jimmy Butler did all he could for the Bulls, as he led the team with 20 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. Taj Gibson also played well, amassing 17 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in the defeat. Rajon Rondo did provide six rebounds and 10 assists, but shot just 1-of-10 from the field to score three points. Dwyane Wade also shot poorly, but accumulated 19 points, three rebounds and three assists. Butler, Rondo and Wade combined to shoot 14-of-50 in the loss. The Bulls will look to get out of this slump on Friday in a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 121-110 Wednesday at Smoothie King Center.

The Thunder (17-12) were once again led by their fearless leader Russell Westbrook, who put together another 40-point performance with 42 points,  10 rebounds and seven assists in just 34 minutes. Westbrook once again carried a team that failed to get many significant contributions from its starters. Alex Abrines, however, did have a surprise performance off the bench Wednesday, scoring 18 points in 30 minutes -- just his second double-digit performance of the season. Additionally, Enes Kanter posted yet another double-double as a reserve, posting 14 points and 14 rebounds in 34 minutes. As a team, the Thunder did shoot the ball rather effectively, hitting 51 percent of their shots overall and 39 percent of their threes. 

The Pelicans (10-21) got another stellar performance out of their superstar forward Anthony Davis, as he posted 34 points and 15 rebounds in 36 minutes. And while Jrue Holiday and Terrence Jones each had great nights themselves, scoring 23 and 21 points respectively, the other nine players who saw the floor for New Orleans managed to score a total of just 32 points. Despite not having a full team effort, the game was ultimately lost for New Orleans on the boards, as they were out-rebounded by the Thunder 49-to-34.

Up next, the Thunder will travel to Boston on Friday to take on the Celtics, while the Pelicans will stay home Friday and play the Heat.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Utah Jazz 94-93 Wednesday at Vivint Smart Home Arena. 

The Kings (12-17) looked sluggish for the first three quarters of Wednesday's game, and rightfully so after a hard-fought home victory over the Trail Blazers the night before. Something clicked, however, in the final period, as Sacramento managed to erase a double-digit victory and pull out the victory thanks to some timely free throws from DeMarcus Cousins. Cousins finished with a team-high 21 points and eight rebounds in 31 minutes as the only starter to reach double figures. Meanwhile, the reserve backcourt pairing of Ty Lawson and Garrett Temple combined for 30 points to help make up for a lackluster performance from the starters. 

For the Jazz (18-12), they came into the game undermanned in the backcourt, with George Hill (toe), Dante Exum (knee) and Rodney Hood (illness) all ruled out prior to Wednesday's matchup. That left their bench thin, and it showed, as the four reserves managed to combine for just 21 points. As a result, it was on Gordon Hayward to carry the load offensively, and he did not disappoint, scoring a game-high 28 points on 9-of-18 shooting from the field on top of 10 rebounds. Rudy Gobert also made his presence felt down low, as not only did he give Cousins' problems from start to finish, but he also managed to record 17 points and 14 rebounds. Ultimately, on a night where both teams were playing the second game of a back-to-back set, the Jazz just couldn't finish the deal in the fourth quarter.

Up next, the Kings will travel to Minnesota on Friday to take on the Timberwolves, while the Jazz will stay at home Friday to play the Raptors.

												The visiting Houston Rockets took down the host Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, 125-111.

Houston (22-8) has won 11 of its last 12 contests, bouncing back with the win over the Suns after having lost to the Spurs on Tuesday night.  Point guard James Harden continued his ridiculous stretch of play, posting a team-high 27 points to go along with 14 assists.  Guard Eric Gordon, meanwhile, scored 24 points off the bench and passed Steph Curry for the league lead in three pointers made thanks to a whopping seven shots from beyond the arc on Wednesday.  Seven Rockets scored in double digits in the win, including every member of the Houston starting five.

Phoenix (8-21) is in the opposite position of Houston, having now lost four straight.  The Suns sit near the bottom of the Western Conference despite having seen strong play from star point guard Eric Bledsoe recently.  On Wednesday, Bledsoe scored 16, but took a back seat to sophomore guard Devin Booker.  Booker poured in a team-high 28 points in addition to six rebounds and seven assists.  Bench players TJ Warren and Brandon Knight scored 19 and 17, respectively.  

The Rockets will visit Memphis on Friday, while the Suns will host the 76ers.

												The visiting Dallas Mavericks took down the host Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, 96-95..

Dallas (8-21) is now 6-8 in its last 14 games after a dismal 2-13 start.  Though veteran star Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles) remains out, the team has seemingly begun to find its groove.  On Wednesday, forward Harrison Barnes led the team with 28 points and added seven rebounds.  Point guard Deron Williams also had 23 points along with five rebounds and five assists.  Dallas excelled on the defensive end, forcing the Blazers to give up 17 turnovers.

Portland (13-18) has seen the opposite trajectory of the Mavs, going ice cold after a hot start to the season.  On Wednesday, guard Damian Lillard was a one-man show, scoring 29 points to lead the team.  No other Blazer had more than 14, and star shooting guard C.J. McCollum was held to just 13.  Portland was able to out-shoot its opponent from the field but struggled to keep the hall secure, holding a seven-turnover disadvantage.  The Blazers have now lost four straight.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 108-93, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday.

The Pelicans (10-20) checked in to Tuesday with only three road victories, but with a 5-13 home record, the Sixers (7-21) didn't exactly shape up as very imposing. Accordingly, New Orleans used a standout effort from Anthony Davis (31 points, 16 boards, two assists, two blocks) and a 53-point contribution from their bench to secure a 15-point win. The Sixers jumped on the Pelicans early and won the first quarter by a 23-15 margin, but New Orleans' 42-point second period gave them the momentum they used the rest of the way. The Pelicans' three-point shooting was particularly impressive, as they tallied a 58.8 percent success rate from behind the arc. 

Terrence Jones was New Orleans' second-leading scorer and accomplished it from the bench, posting 17 points, 10 rebounds and three assists over 30 minutes. E'Twaun Moore was next in a reserve role as well, supplying 15 points and two assists. Jrue Holiday's offensive downturn continued, but he did fill out the stat sheet with 12 points, nine assists and four rebounds, although he shot just 4-of-14 from the field. Buddy Hield drew the start and poured in 10 points, while also recording a rebound and an assist.

Although Joel Embiid and Jahil Okafor started together once again, it was reserve big man Ersan Ilyasova who led the Sixers in scoring, totaling 14 points, four rebounds and a block. Gerald Henderson managed 13 points, three rebounds, an assist and a block. A trio of 11-point efforts from Okafor, Embiid and Robert Covington followed, with the big men also contributing seven, six and eight rebounds, respectively. T.J. McConnell was also productive in a reserve role, supplying 10 points.

The Pelicans visit the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday night, while the Sixers hit the road to face the Phoenix Suns on Friday evening.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 117-113, at Spectrum Center on Tuesday.

A somewhat surprisingly tightly-contested battle saw the Lakers (11-20) ambush the host Hornets (16-13) early, building an impressive 41-35 lead after one quarter. They didn't take their foot off the gas in the second quarter, which led to an even more eye-opening 73-59 edge at halftime. However, Charlotte apparently got a wake-up call at intermission, outscoring their visitors 58-40 over the final two periods. Fittingly, it was the dynamic backcourt duo of Nicolas Batum and Kemba Walker that led the way, and that helped seal the victory when things tightened up late. A Marco Belinelli three-pointer with 2:21 remaining knotted the game up at 113, but it was Batum who put the finishing touches on the win by draining an eight-foot basket with 13 seconds on the clock, and two free throws with six ticks left to provide the final margin of victory.

The Lakers were led by Jordan Clarkson off the bench, as he went with 25 points, five assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Starting two-guard Nick Young was right behind him with 24 points and two boards. D'Angelo Russell supplied 15 points, five boards, five assists and two blocks. Luol Deng went furnished 11 points, seven rebounds, an assist and three blocks, while Larry Nance, Jr. also was productive in a reserve role, totaling 10 points over 21 minutes.

Walker's 28 points, which came on 11-of-26 shooting, paced the Hornets, a total he supplemented with 10 assists and eight rebounds. Batum had his own double-double with 23 points, 10 assists, five rebounds and a steal. Marvin Williams continued his recently resurgent offensive play, posting 15 points, five rebounds and a pair of assists. Cody Zeller registered 11 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Belinelli and Frank Kaminsky III went for 13 and 11 points, respectively, off the bench.

The Lakers head down to South Florida for a Thursday evening date with the Miami Heat, while the Hornets are home again against the Bulls on Friday night.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 116-104, at Air Canada Centre on Tuesday.

The Nets (7-20) already faced some tough odds before the opening tip, as they checked in to Tuesday as losers in 11 of 12 road games, while the Raptors (20-8) had tallied 10 of their 19 wins at home. Both trends endured Tuesday, as Toronto rode a solid team shooting night and strong efforts from Kyle Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas to secure the victory. The Raptors tallied success rates of 46.2 and 44.4 percent, respectively, from the field and three-point range, while holding their visitors to under 40 percent shooting overall.

The Nets were led by a pair of bench players, with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who posted 19 points, six boards, three assists, a steal and a block in 20 minutes, leading the way. Spencer Dinwiddie was second with 14 points, four rebounds, an assist and a block. Jeremy Lin drew the start and paced the first unit with 12 points, four assists, two boards, a steal and a block. Trevor Booker supplied 11 points, five rebounds, two assists and a steal. However, no other member of the starting five got into double digits in the scoring column, as Luis Scola (nine points), Sean Kilpatrick (eight points) and Bojan Bogdanovic (five points) notably underperformed. 

Lowry filled out the stat sheet with 23 points, eight assists, four rebounds, three steals and a block. DeMarre Carroll was next with 17 points and three boards, going 7-of-11 from the field and 3-of-6 from behind the arc. DeMar DeRozan had a modest 15 points, which he complemented with two assists, a rebound and a steal. Valanciunas stepped up with a 10-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included a block. Terrence Ross led the second unit with a season-high 21 points, while also notching three rebounds, an assist and a game-high five steals. Cory Joseph was productive off the bench as well, tallying 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists.

The Nets head back home to face the Golden State Warriors on Thursday evening, while the Raptors travel to Utah for a Friday evening date with the Jazz.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers, 118-111, at Madison Square Garden on Monday. 

These are two teams who will likely compete for a playoff spot in the east and this game had a playoff atmosphere to it. New York really turned it on late to pull out the comeback, as they outscored Indiana, 34-24 in the fourth quarter. The key for New York was three point-shooting, as they went 13-of-23, while holding the Pacers to just 6-of-23 from long range. Defensive rebounding was a big advantage for the Knicks as well, winning that battle, 41-33. While there were only five ties and six lead changes, neither team led by more than 15 as it was a competitive game throughout. 

Indiana (15-15) have yet to have a winning streak of longer than two games and they were unable to crack that spell again here. Myles Turner continued his good form though, leading the team with 21 points, nine rebounds and four blocks. Thaddeus Young matched that 21-point total, adding seven rebounds and two steals to his tally. Jeff Teague accumulated 17 points, seven rebounds and 12 assists in the defeat. Al Jefferson was a great speak off the bench, dropping 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting. The Pacers will host the Boston Celtics on Thursday for their next game. 

New York (15-13) had their first home game in quite some time, so they made fans happy with this crucial win. Carmelo Anthony had a vintage performance, as he tallied 35 points, four rebounds and four assists. Derrick Rose wasn't far behind, as he accrued 24 points, four rebounds and six assists. Kristaps Porzingis finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and three blocks. Joakim Noah had one of his best games as a Knick, recording an 11-point, 11-rebound double-double. The Knicks will have another home game on Thursday against the Orlando Magic.

These are two teams that have struggled offensively all season, so a numbers boosting double-overtime game may be what they need to find some momentum. Orlando were the ones who escaped with the win, as they won the second overtime, 18-12. Shooting was key for the Magic, as they shot 50 percent from the field and from three-point range. Both teams struggled at the free-throw line, as they each failed to crack 70 percent shooting. There were 10 ties and 27 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 12 points. 

Orlando (13-17) haven't had much to get excited about this season, but a double-overtime road win may be just what they need to get going. Nikola Vucevic was the Magic's best player, as he totaled 26 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. Evan Fournier matched his 26 points and added five rebounds and four assists to his tally in the victory. Serge Ibaka accumulated 20 points, nine rebounds and two assists. Elfrid Payton came off the bench to collect 22 points, two rebounds and six assists. Orlando will return to action on Thursday in a road matchup with the New York Knicks. 

Miami (9-20) continue to play well, but they simply can't win games. Hassan Whiteside did all he could though, as he had game-highs with 32 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks in the defeat. Tyler Johnson was fantastic off the bench, accruing a career-high 32 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals before fouling out in overtime. Goran Dragic went just 6-of-17 from the field, but tallied 19 points, four rebounds and five assists before fouling out himself. James Johnson was also productive off the bench, providing 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Miami's next game will be on Thursday, when they host the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 114-108, in overtime at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Tuesday. 

Teams tend to show up when the Cavaliers come to their home building and that was just the case here. Cleveland actually led for the majority of the game, as Milwaukee had to ride a 22-16 fourth quarter to get to overtime. From there, the Cavs took over by wining the overtime, 14-8 and finished the game on a 7-0 run. The key for Cleveland was three-point shooting, as they went 17-of-40 from long distance in their win. Milwaukee actually dominated the shooting, as they went 46 percent from the field and held Cleveland to just 41 percent. 

Cleveland (20-6) had to play this game without Kevin Love, but they have two other players who aren't too shabby. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving carried the load, as they combined for 62 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists in the overtime victory. James led the team with 34 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists, while Irving provided 28 points, five rebounds and five assists. The only other starter in double figures was Tristan Thompson, who totaled 10 points and 12 rebounds. Channing Frye led the bench, scoring 15 points, while adding three rebounds and two assists. 

Milwaukee (13-13) left it all on the floor in their home building, but it simply wasn't enough against a better Cleveland team. Jabari Parker led the team in scoring, as he collected 30 points, nine rebounds and three assists in the defeat. Giannis Antetokounmpo got off to a slow start, but still finished with 25 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks before fouling out in the overtime. John Henson was the only other starter in double figures, as he accrued 14 points and eight rebounds. No bench player scored more than eight points or played more than 20 minutes. 

These teams will have a rematch on Wednesday in Cleveland to cap off their home-and-home set.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 112-109 in overtime Tuesday at FedExForum.

The Celtics (16-12) needed big comeback effort in the fourth quarter to force overtime, and it was clear once they managed to reach overtime basketball, star point guard Isaiah Thomas was not going to let them lose. Thomas finished with a season-high 44 points, six assists, three rebounds and two steals in 38 minutes, as he point guard was on fire from every spot on the floor, shooting 10-of-16 from the field, 7-of-10 from behind the arc and 17-of-17 from the free throw line. Thomas carried the team on his back for all 53 minutes, while Al Horford finished with a double-double of 17 points and 14 rebounds and Jae Crowder posted a solid line of 13 points and seven rebounds. In the end, Boston won by making the most of their trips to the charity stripe, hitting 32 of their 34 free throw attempts Tuesday.

While Boston managed to win their third straight game, the Grizzlies found a way to lose their third straight as they've reached a rough patch in their otherwise hot start to the regular season. Marc Gasol put together a great all-around performance despite fading offensively down the stretch, as he posted a team-high 24 points, seven rebounds and six assists, while Mike Conley 19 points, five rebounds and eight assists himself. Additionally, just a game removed from a scoreless performance, Troy Daniels rebounded nicely with 24 points in 35 minutes off the bench for Memphis. 

Up next, the Celtics will head to Indiana on Thursday to take on the Pacers, while the Grizzlies will have an opporunity to end their win streak Wednesday in Detroit.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Houston Rockets 102-100 Tuesday at Toyota Center.

The Spurs (23-5) entered the fourth quarter down seven points after the Rockets (21-8) put together a dominant performance in the third period to take the lead. But San Antonio, being the road warriors they are, managed to extend their record away from home to 15-1 thanks to a game-winning Patty Mills jumper with just 12 seconds left. Eric Gordon and James Harden both had their shot at game-winners after that, but failed to convert on their home floor. Mills finished with 13 points off the bench for the Spurs, but it was Kawhi Leonard who once again led the way for his team, scoring a team-high 21 points on top of five rebounds, four assists and five steals. LaMarcus Aldridge added a double-double of 17 points and 10 rebounds. 

For the Rockets, Tuesday's defeat put an end to their 10-game win streak, but, for the team being, they remain in third place in the Western Conference standings. James Harden led the way for Houston with 31 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, but he shot just 10-of-26 from the field and 1-of-11 from behind the arc. And that cold streak from 3-point range was contagious, as the team as a whole shot a miserable 6-of-38 (15.8 percent) from long range after being nearly unstoppable from behind the arc over their win streak.

Up next, the Spurs will look to continue their winning ways on the road Thursday when they take on the Clippers, while the Rockets look to get back on track Wednesday in Phoenix.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Denver Nuggets 119-102 at Staples Center on Tuesday. 

This game appeared to be over as soon as the Clippers (21-8) opened up a 10-point lead after the first quarter. From there, they continued to pile it on, as the Nuggets (12-17), who were playing in their second game of a back-to-back set, simply couldn't keep pace. In their first game since it was announced that Blake Griffin would be out for at least four weeks following arthroscopic surgery, Los Angeles was led by a superb shooting performance from J.J. Redick, who shot 10-of-16 from the field overall and 7-of-9 from behind the arc. Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan each added double-doubles, with Paul posting 16 points and 15 assists on top of eight rebonds in just 26 minutes, while Jordan recorded 13 points and 13 boards. As a team, the Clippers were prolific on the offensive end, shooting 54.7 percent from the field overall and an impressive 44.4 percent from long range. 

As for the Nuggets, Tuesday's loss ended what was a three-game winning streak for them, as the Clippers managed to overwhelm them with their size and athleticism. Fresh off a night where he came an assist away from posting a triple-double, starting center Nikola Jokic put in an rather underwhelming performance, recording just nine points and six rebounds in 21 minutes. Will Barton ended up leading the way off the bench for Denver, posting a team-high 22 points in 32 minutes off the bench. The Nuggets ended up leaving far too many points at the free throw line as a team, missing seven of their 20 attempts from the charity stripe Tuesday.

Up next, the Clippers will stay home Wednesday to take on the Spurs, while the Nuggets will look to bounce back at home Wednesday against the Hawks.

Golden State (25-4) remains the league's top team thanks to the win.  The Warriors have now won five straight and sit atop the Western Conference, though San Antonio sits just one game back from the lead.  On Tuesday, the sailing looked as smooth as ever for the Golden State ""superteam,"" as former MVPs Steph Curry and Kevin Durant combined to score 47.  All-Star forward Draymond Green, meanwhile, had 15 points and 11 assists, as well as five steals on the defensive end.  All-Star Klay Thompson also had 17.

The Jazz (18-11) had won four straight before being blown out on Tuesday.  Utah remains hampered by major injuries, as starters George Hill and Derrick Favors were forced to sit out the game in Oakland.  It was nothing short of an awful offensive performance for the depleted team, as the Jazz shot just 35 percent from the field and turned the ball over 23 times.  Despite the team's intense struggles, big man Rudy Gobert continued to dominate, recording a game-high 16 rebounds and shooting 5-of-6 on the night.  

The Jazz will host the Kings on Wednesday, while Golden State will travel to Brooklyn to face the Nets on Thursday.

												The host Sacramento Kings defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 126-121, behind 55 points from All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins.

It was an interesting night for Sacramento (11-17), as the team came away with the win despite an emotional roller coaster.  Center DeMarcus Cousins was awarded a technical foul and ejected for spitting out his mouthpiece, but then saw the ejection rescinded.  The confusing call seemed to have rubbed Cousins the wrong way, as he expressed anger at the ""ridiculous"" officiating in a heated post-game interview.  While many will talk about the controversial mouthpiece call, Cousins had one of the best nights of his career en route to the Sacramento victory.  The star center dropped 55 points to go along with 13 rebounds and three blocks.  Cousins sealed the game with a clutch block on Blazers point guard Damian Lillard, ending what was truly a memorable performance.

Portland (13-17) is heading in the wrong direction, having now lost seven of its last eight.  The backcourt of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum shined in Tuesday's game, but did not perform well enough to seal the win.  McCollum led the team with 36 points, while Lillard had 24 and dished out 15 assists.  Blazers center Mason Plumlee scored 27 while delivering 13 rebounds as well.  Plumlee saw things get heated between him and Cousins at points, as both centers delivered terrific performances in the close game.

The Kings will visit Utah on Wednesday, while Portland will host the Mavericks.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Washington Wizards, 107-105, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday.

An entertaining, high-scoring affair fittingly came down to the buzzer, as Bradley Beal misfired on a 22-foot three-point jumper that would have sent the Wizards (12-15) home winners. With less than a second remaining, it has been Thaddeus Young who'd made a clutch basket for the Pacers (15-14) to snap a 105-105 deadlock. The game featured a strong first quarter from Washington in which they outscored their hosts by a 36-29 margin. However, Indiana roared back to outpace the visitors by a 59-43 margin over the second and third periods, before seeing the Wizards make a comeback over the final 12 minutes. Both teams saw their first units come through, as each boasted four double-digit scorers among their respective starting five.

Beal led the way for the Wizards with 22 points, three assists and a rebound. However, he was only 3-of-11 from behind the arc, with his biggest miss being the aforementioned final attempt of the night. Marcin Gortat delivered a trademark 21-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist. John Wall went for 19 points, 10 assists, five rebounds and a pair of steals. Otto Porter, Jr. had a near double-double of his own with 17 points and nine boards, along with three blocks and a steal. 

Paul George tallied a game-high 27 points for the Pacers, a haul that he complemented with nine boards, two assists and a steal. Jeff Teague enjoyed a stat-sheet-filling night with 23 points, 10 assists, four rebounds and three steals. Myles Turner registered 20 points and eight boards, while also recording a game-high five blocks. Young had a modest 12 points, but he did haul in 11 rebounds and drained the biggest shot of the night. He also recorded a pair of assists and two steals. C.J. Miles and Al Jefferson provided their typically solid work off the bench with matching 10-point efforts.

The Wizards remain on the road and next visit the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday evening, while the Pacers visit the New York Knicks on Tuesday night.

												The Chicago Bulls blew out the Detroit Pistons, 113-82, at United Center on Monday. 

This was as lopsided of a game as you'll see in the NBA, as none of the starters played in the fourth quarter. The first half was when it really got out of hand, as the Bulls led 69-34 headed into the locker room. In that first half, Chicago shot 73 percent from the field and dished out 24 assists. For the game, the Bulls shot 60 percent and recorded 34 assists in 49 made baskets. They also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle, 46-32. This was a wire-to-wire win for the Bulls, as they held a double-digit lead for the final 40-plus minutes. 

Detroit (14-16) has struggled on the road all season and this sort of loss only adds to those deficiencies. Not one of the five starters played well, as none of them surpassed 10 points, four rebounds or three assists. Tobias Harris was the lone starter in double figures, as he tallied 10 points and four rebounds. Jon Leuer led the team in scoring, as he tallied 16 points and five rebounds on 7-of-9 shooting off the bench. Detroit will look to play better on Wednesday, when they host the Memphis Grizzlies for their next game.

Chicago (14-13) had been struggling coming into this game, so a blowout win like this is just what they needed. All five starters for the Bulls played well, as they each scored in double figures and all shot at least 60 percent from the field. Jimmy Butler led the team in scoring, as he accumulated 19 points, three rebounds and six assists. Rajon Rondo fell just shy of a triple-double, as he collected 10 points, eight rebounds and 14 assists. Taj Gibson went a perfect 8-of-8 from the field to total 16 points and four boards. Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic provided 13 points a piece off the bench. The Bulls will look to keep rolling on Wednesday, when they host the Washington Wizards for their next game.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-108 Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

Monday's game came with no shortage of drama, as after plenty of back and forth in the final period, Paul Millsap sit a short jumper that put the Hawks (14-14) up by two with just 12 seconds remaining. The Thunder (16-12), with one last opportunity remaining went to their star guard Russell Westbrook, who missed a jumper, got the rebound and got his shot blocked before Oklahoma City was able to call one last timeout. The Thunder inbounded it to Westbrook again, who missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer, and while Steven Adams was able to get the rebound for Oklahoma City, his dunk at buzzer was ruled no good. 

In the end, it was a battle between the team's two starting point guards, with Dennis Schroder and Westbrook putting together two of their very best performances of the season. Schroder scored 31 points on 10-of-16 shooting from the field -- his second 30-point game of the season -- on top of eight assists and five rebounds. Meanwhile, Westbrook posted 46 points -- his second highest total this season -- seven assists and 11 rebounds in 35 minutes. Ultimately, the deciding factor Monday was that Schroder got help from his teammates, while the rest of the Thunder players struggled. Atlanta's Millsap recorded 30 points and 11 rebounds in 39 minutes, while the next highest scorer for Oklahoma City was Jerami Grant with 15 off the bench.

												The host Minnesota Timberwolves took down the Phoenix Suns on Monday, 115-108.

Minnesota (8-19) has had a disappointing start to the season but received a confidence boost with a strong win on Monday.  Reigning Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns led the way with 28 points, 15 rebounds, and two blocks.  The Wolves' other two young studs, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, also turned out impressive performances.  Wiggins delivered 26 points, while LaVine dropped 23 including four three-pointers.  Minnesota had an astounding night from the free-throw line, making 24-of-25 from the charity stripe.

Phoenix (8-20) continues to struggle as well, falling to the second-worst record in the Western Conference with the loss.  Despite the team's troubles, guard Eric Bledsoe has impressed.  On Monday, Bledsoe scored 27 points and came away with two steals on the defensive end.  The Suns also saw strong play from their bench, as guard Brandon Knight dropped 21 points and went 8-of-13 from the field.  Two other Suns bench players scored in double digits.

The Wolves will visit the Hawks on Wednesday, while the Suns will host the Rockets.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 117-107 at Pepsi Center on Monday. 

The wire-to-wire affair never saw one team pull away from the other, however, the control was mostly in favor of the Nuggets. The Mavericks (7-21) entered the game with an onslaught of injuries facing their lineup, including Dirk Nowitzki (achilles), Andrew Bogut (knee) and J.J. Barea (calf). All five Nuggets (12-16) starters finished in double figures scoring, led by Nikola Jokic and his 27 points. The impressive performance from Denver's power forward also fell just one assist shy of a big triple-double, as he finished with 15 rebounds and nine assists on 13-of-17 shooting. Jamal Murray saw 14 minutes of action after dealing with soreness, but only contributed three points on four shots. 

The injuries have derailed the season for the Mavericks, who will struggle to compete with even the mid-level opponents. The road struggle continues for Dallas as well, who have just one road win on the year. Deron Williams led the team with 23 points, to go along with rebound and eight assists. Harrison Barnes also contributed an efficient effort with 19 points on 9-of-15 shooting. Impressively, both teams shot above 50 percent as a unit, but the strong 53.1 percent effort from the Mavericks was overshadowed by the even more powerful 57 percent effort from the Nuggets. 

The Nuggets play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, while the Mavericks visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 117-110, at Verizon Center on Sunday.

The contest was a battle of two surging squads, with the Clippers (20-8) having checked in to Sunday on a four-game win streak, and the Wizards (12-14) having prevailed in four of their previous five contests as well. The high-scoring affair was befitting of two teams on the rise, and was tightly-contested through all four quarters. Ultimately, Bradley Beal's season-high 41 points, which came on the strength of a 13-of-23 shooting tally from the field, as well as a 6-of-10 mark from three-point range, was too much for the visitors to overcome. Markieff Morris had the hot hand for Washington as well, going 10-of-17 from the floor on his way to 23 points. The two stellar offensive efforts led to impressive success rates of 53.1 percent and 52.6 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively, for the hosts. 

The Clippers saw Blake Griffin's 26 points lead the way, a total he supplemented with seven rebounds, seven assists and a steal. J.J. Redick checked in a rather distant second with 17 points and a rebound. Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan turned in a pair of 13-point performances that were part of double-doubles. Paul also dished out 12 assists and recorded four rebounds and a pair of steals, while Jordan hauled in 17 boards, handed out two assists and posted a block. Mareese Speights led the second unit with 14 points, while Austin Rivers, back on the bench due to the surprising return of Luc Mbah a Moute from a shoulder injury, contributed 13 points. 

Beal added three rebounds, three assists and a steal to his aforementioned game-high scoring haul. Morris supplemented his 23 points with nine rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block. John Wall registered an 18-point, 11-assist double-double that also featured five rebounds, a steal and a block. Otto Porter and Marcin Gortat contributed matching nine-point tallies, with the former adding four rebounds, two assists and three steals, and the latter supplying seven rebounds, a steal and two blocks. 

The Clippers head back home to face the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Wizards travel to Indiana for a Monday evening date with the Pacers.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Sacramento Kings, 99-79, at American Airlines Center on Sunday.

The Kings (10-17) checked in to the contest short-handed, as both Rudy Gay (hip) and Omri Casspi (illness) were sidelined. That put the onus on DeMarcus Cousins even more than usual, and he did respond with a game-high 33 points, along with six rebounds and a block. However, it was far from enough to offset single-digit scoring tallies from the remainder of Sacramento's starting five. Meanwhile, the Mavs (7-20) saw six players hit double digits in the scoring column, while shooting a solid 44.9 percent from the field as a team. 

Kosta Koufos was the next most productive starter for the Kings, albeit a distant second to Cousins' standout effort. Koufos posted six points, nine rebounds and a pair of steals. Garrett Temple and Ben McLemore posted a pair of five-point efforts, and Darren Collison turned in a disappointing two points, three assists and a rebound on just 1-of-8 shooting over 25 minutes. Ty Lawson paced the bench with 10 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal.

Dorian Finney-Smith led the way for Dallas with 17 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal. Harrison Barnes was just short of a double-double with 15 points, nine boards, two assists, three steals and a block. Deron Williams and Wesley Matthews also had matching 15-point efforts, while shooting a combined 11-of-23. Devin Harris (14 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal) and Seth Curry (13 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals) were highly productive in reserve roles. 

Sacramento heads back home for a Tuesday evening date with the Trail Blazers, while the Mavericks travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Monday night.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 82-73, at FedExForum Arena on Sunday.

As was to be expected in a meeting of two of the NBA's stingiest defenses, the game was a low-scoring, grind-it-out affair, one played amidst a cacophony of whistles from the referees. The two teams were called for a total of 48 personal fouls, with the Grizzlies (18-11) guilty of 28 of those. After combining for just 69 points in the first half, both offenses picked it up in the third period, and the Jazz (18-10) was able to finally separate in the fourth quarter. Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert led the way for the visitors with 22 and 21 points, respectively, and Utah was able to limit Memphis to 30.1 percent shooting from the field and a minuscule 8.7 percent tally from beyond the arc.

Hayward added seven rebounds, six assists, three blocks and two steals to his team-high scoring total. Gobert turned in a double-double, as he hauled in 12 rebounds in addition to his aforementioned 21 points. He also recorded a trio of blocks and a steal. Boris Diaw checked in with 11 points, six rebounds and three assists, while Rodney Hood poured in 10 points and supplemented them with four boards and an assist. Shelvin Mack paced the second unit with 10 points, six rebounds, five assists and a steal. 

The Grizzlies saw Mike Conley lead the way with 14 points, which he complemented with four dimes and a steal. JaMychal Green was second amongst the starters with a 10 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and a block. Tony Allen contributed a full stat line of nine points, eight boards, an assist and two steals. Marc Gasol had a forgettable night from the field, posting only eight points on 4-of-22 shooting. He did add seven rebounds, four assists and a steal. Veteran Zach Randolph continued his strong work off the bench with a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double.

The Jazz head west to take on the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, while the Grizzlies are home again on Tuesday evening versus the Boston Celtics.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 108-107, at Wells Fargo Center on Sunday.

While these are two teams that have struggled this season, they left it all on the floor in this close-fought battle. There were nine ties and 21 lead changes, as neither team led by more than nine points. The Sixers did a great job of closing things out at the free-throw line, as they went 20-of-23 from the charity stripe in the win. Rebounding was a big factor for the Sixers as well, winning that battle. 48-43, and doubling up the Nets in offensive rebounds.

Brooklyn (7-19) have now lost 14 of their last 17 games, but they put in a strong effort in this close loss. Brook Lopez flirted with a triple-double in the defeat, tallying 22 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Bojan Bogdanovic was second among the starters, as he scored 14 points and grabbed six boards. Joe Harris led the bench in scoring, as he dropped 19 points, two rebounds and two assists. Jeremy Lin came off the bench once again, as he accumulated 16 points, two rebounds and four assists. On deck for the Nets is a road matchup against the Toronto Raptors.

Philadelphia (7-20) have been playing better than their record would indicate, so a win here was just what the doctor ordered. Joel Embiid added to his crazy rookie numbers, as he scored a career-high 33 points to go along with 10 rebounds and three blocks. Jahlil Okafor had a strange game, as he totaled three points and 11 rebounds on 0-of-10 shooting. Ersan Ilyasova was second on the team, as he scored 22 points on 7-of-12 shooting off the bench. The Sixers will look to keep rolling on Tuesday against the New Orleans Pelicans.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Orlando Magic, 109-79, at Amway Center on Sunday. 

These are two teams going in opposite directions and this result shows just which way. Despite the Magic leading for the majority of the first half, they really fell apart in the middle quarters. In fact, Toronto won the second and third quarters, 61-34 to eventually pull away and win by 30. Defense was key for the Raptors, as they held the Magic to 41 percent from the field and 3-of-21 from three-point range. Toronto were very efficient on their end as well, shooting 49 percent from the field and assisting on 20 of their 43 made baskets. 

Toronto (19-8) have been scoring at will recently, but they got this win through dominant defense. DeMar DeRozan was the player of the game, as he tallied 31 points, five rebounds and four assists in just three quarters of action. Kyle Lowry also played just three quarters, but accumulated 16 points, three rebounds and 10 assists. Jonas Valanciunas recorded a double-double, totaling 16 points and 13 rebounds in the win. Toronto will look keep rolling on Tuesday, as they host the Brooklyn Nets for their next game. 

Orlando (12-17) have struggled offensively all season and games like this have become all too common.  Evan Fournier led the team in scoring, as he dropped 15 points, three rebounds and three assists. Bismack Biyombo played well against his former team, as he accrued eight points, 12 rebounds and three blocks in the defeat. Nikola Vucevic came off the bench to provide 10 points and nine rebounds. Orlando's next game is on Tuesday, as they play the Miami Heat on the road.

												The visiting Boston Celtics took down the Miami Heat on Sunday, 105-95.

Boston (15-12) has now won both games since the return of star point guard Isaiah Thomas.  Thomas suffered a groin injury in the Celtics' loss to Houston earlier in the month, but has returned as strong as ever, leading the Celtics in scoring in both games since his return.  Thomas had 23 points on Sunday in addition to four assists.  Guard Avery Bradley added 20 points, while All-Star center Al Horford scored another 17.  Boston was able to win the game on the back of strong defensive play.  Despite allowing Miami to hit 52 percent of its shots, the Celtics forced a ridiculous 23 turnovers, including 13 steals.  Five of those came from Jae Crowder, who also chipped in 15 points on the offensive end.

Miami (9-19) has struggled mightily thus far this season.  The team came out slow on Sunday, allowing the Celtics to outscore them 37-19 in the first quarter.  The Heat were unable to come back from the stagnant start, despite shooting 52 percent from the field.  However, Miami went just 14-of-25 from the free-throw line.  The team also turned the ball over 23 times on the night.  Center Hassan Whiteside dominated despite the team's struggles.  Whiteside had 23 points, 17 rebounds, and three blocks.  Guard Goran Dragic also had a nice night, scoring 31 points to go with five rebounds and seven assists.

The Heat will host the Magic on Tuesday, while the Celtics will visit Memphis.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, 113-100.

The Spurs (22-5) have now won four straight and are 15-1 on the road this season.  San Antonio holds the league's second-best record and remains just a game out of first place in the Western Conference.  On Sunday, forward LaMarcus Aldridge led the team with 22 points while hitting all 10 of his free-throws.  The Spurs out-rebounded the Pelicans a whopping 49-37, including 14 from veteran big man Pau Gasol.  The team also shot impeccably, hitting 48 percent from the field and hitting 50 percent from beyond the arc.  

The Pelicans (9-20) have seen an underwhelming start to their 2016-17 campaign.  On Sunday, the team struggled in particular, trailing by double digits for the majority of the game.  Star Anthony Davis, the league's second-leading scorer, was held to just 12 points and four rebounds in what was a dull night for the young superstar.  The team reached the free-throw line 14 times and hit only eight.

The Pelicans will visit the 76ers on Tuesday, while the Spurs will travel to Houston.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Phoenix Suns, 114-101, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday.

Russell Westbrook has been virtually unstoppable the majority of the season, but had been somewhat human the last three games after seeing a streak of seven consecutive triple-doubles snapped against the Celtics on Dec. 11. However, matched up Saturday against one of the most porous defenses in the league, especially against point guards, the perennial All-Star exploded for 26 points, a career-high 22 assists and 11 rebounds, his 50th career triple-double. He added two steals and a block as well. His spectacular performance helped negate a remarkable effort on the other side from Devin Booker, who broke out of some recent scoring doldrums in impressive fashion with a game-high 31-points. The caliber of Westbrook's production was such that it enabled the Thunder (16-11) to post a double-digit victory despite getting outshot by the Suns (8-19) 50.6 to 43.3 percent from the field and 43.8 percent to 36.4 percent from three-point range.

Booker added five assists, three boards and a steal to his aforementioned scoring haul. Eric Bledsoe, who was tormented by Westbrook for four quarters, finished with 12 points, four assists and three rebounds. Tyson Chandler came within a rebound of one of his trademark double-doubles, posting 10 points and hauling in nine boards. Marquese Chriss was productive with an eight-point, eight-rebound tally, while Jared Dudley and the returning Alex Len paced the reserves with a pair of matching eight-point efforts themselves.

Steven Adams was solid in support of Westbrook offensively, compiling 19 points, seven boards, two assists and two steals. Anthony Morrow produced 11 points and two steals while drawing the start at shooting guard in place of the sidelined Victor Oladipo (wrist), while Andre Roberson matched his point total and added a rebound and three steals. Domantas Sabonis contributed nine points, four rebounds, a steal and a block, and Enes Kanter led the bench with 12 points, five rebounds, an assist and a block.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 105-90, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Saturday.

The Pacers (14-14) came in to Saturday's contest with a dubious road record, as they'd managed to only secure three wins in nine tries away from home. However, a standout effort from Paul George led the way to a surprisingly comfortable victory Saturday, as the All-Star tallied 26 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. However, Indiana's entire first unit was impressive as a whole, as all five members of the starting five posted double-digit scoring. The Pacers also shot 48.2 percent overall, while holding the Pistons (14-15) to sub-40 percent success rates from the field and three-point range.

Jeff Teague was second on the visitors with a stat-sheet-stuffing line of 19 points, nine rebounds, eight assists and two steals. Glenn Robinson III and Thaddeus Young contributed a pair of 12-point efforts, with the former adding an impressive 12 rebounds, and the latter supplying three assists, two boards and a steal. Myles Turner had a modest game by his standards, posting 10 points, five rebounds, an assist and two blocks. C.J. Miles led the way with 10 points, three rebounds and an assist.

The Pistons were led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's 20 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, three assists and a steal. Reggie Jackson was right behind him with a 19-point, 10-assist double-double that also included three rebounds and a steal, and that represented his best overall game of the season. Tobias Harris registered 13 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Andre Drummond and Marcus Morris turned in nine points apiece, with the former also hauling in 15 rebounds. 

The Pacers head back home to face off with the Washington Wizards on Monday night, while the Pistons head to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Monday evening as well.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 107-99, at Phillips Arena on Saturday.

A strong shooting night overall helped the Hornets (15-13) score an impressive road victory over their conference rival. Charlotte shot 48.9 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from three-point range, which helped them overcome some impressive performances from several members of the Hawks (13-14), including a 23-rebound effort from Dwight Howard. Marco Belinelli and Marvin Williams were the somewhat surprising co-leaders in scoring on the night for the visitors with a pair of 19-point tallies.

Williams added six rebounds, two assists and a steal while pacing to his first unit-leading scoring haul. Kemba Walker returned from a one-game absence for personal reasons to post an 18-point, 10-assist double-double that also included six rebounds. Cody Zeller fashioned a 16-point, 11-rebound double-double of his own, while also supplying an assist and a steal. Nicolas Batum, who led the Hornets' offense in Walker's absence Friday, posted a modest seven points, four assists, three rebounds and four steals. Belinelli complemented his aforementioned 19-point contribution with three rebounds and an assist.

Tim Hardaway, Jr. paced the Hawks with 21 points, four rebounds, four assists and a block. Paul Millsap was right behind him with 20 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal. Dennis Schroder registered 12 points, six assists and four rebounds. Howard added 10 points, an assist and a steal to his game-high rebound total. Kent Bazemore led the second unit with 17 points, five assists, four rebounds and a block. 

The Hornets head back home to face off with the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday evening, while the Hawks head to Oklahoma City to tangle with the Thunder on Monday night.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Los Angeles Lakers, 119-108, at Quicken Loans Arena on Saturday evening.

It was the second night of a back-to-back and fourth game of a seven-game road trip for the Lakers (11-19) and despite leading 31-26 after one quarter they were out-scored in the following three quarters, leading to their ninth loss in 10 games. Meanwhile the Cavs (19-6) rested their big three during their last game on Wednesday and it paid off as they all turned in monstrous nights.

Cleveland owned the paint, where they out-scored the Lakers 50-30. Both teams tallied 30 assists and shot over 40 percent from long range in the back-and-forth contest. 

Kevin Love came up big as he finished with 27 points on 11-of-20 shooting, along with 17 rebounds, four assists and one steal, in 33 minutes. LeBron James added an equally impressive 26 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter, to go along with nine assists, seven rebounds, two steals and two blocks. Kyrie Irving joined the party with 21 points, 12 assists, six rebounds and three steals. The Cavs sit atop the East and are 6-4 on the road as they go on to play in Milwaukee on Tuesday. 

D'Angelo Russell sat this one out for rest but nonetheless, five players scored in double figures for the Lakers, including Nick Young who drained a career-high eight three-pointers, on his way to a game-high 32 points, on 12-of-19 shooting, in 38 minutes. Julius Randle chipped in 16 points on 8-of-15 shooting and dished seven assists, in 28 minutes, while Jordan Clarkson tallied 20 points, in 31 minutes off the bench. The Lakers will take on the Hornets in Charlotte on Tuesday, while they are 5-12 on the road so far this season.

												The Houston Rockets earned their tenth-straight win and did it in epic fashion as they came back from a 12-point deficit with two and a half minutes left in the fourth quarter, to defeat the host Minnesota Timberwolves, 111-109, in overtime, at Target Center on Saturday evening. 

The Timberwolves (7-19) led the entire second half and were ahead 93-81 with two and a half minutes to go but fell apart in the final minutes, allowing the Rockets (21-7) to come back thanks to a clutch three by Trevor Ariza with six seconds remaining, that sent the game to overtime. James Harden scored the Rockets' first seven points in overtime, followed by a three from Eric Gordon and some clutch team free throw shooting to finish off a 30-16 run by Houston in the final seven and a half minutes of action, and seal the win. 

Harden was one assist shy of his third-straight triple-double as he finished with 28 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds, in 43 minutes of action. Ryan Anderson got out to a hot start, shooting 3-of-5 from long range in the first quarter; he finished the game 7-of-16 from downtown, with 28 points. Eric Gordon continued his strong play, with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists, in 36 minutes off the bench. The Rockets shot 17-of-51 from long range and 40.6 percent from the field overall. This marked the second night of a back-to-back and third game in four nights for the Rockets, however they dug deep to move to 5-0 on the second night of a back-to back, and 11-5 on the road. Houston now looks ahead to Tuesday when it hosts the Spurs. 

Karl-Anthony Towns had a monstrous night for the T-Wolves, with a game-high 41 points on 15-of-28 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and five assists, in 43 minutes. Zach LaVine added 24 points, along with six assists, while Andrew Wiggins was quiet offensively with only 13 points, to go along with six rebounds, five assists and three steals. The Timberwolves gave up 22 turnovers in the game including a few late, which cost them what could have been a great win.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the New York Knicks, 127-114, at Pepsi Center on Saturday.

With Carmelo Anthony returning to Denver, the Nuggets played with some serious motivation. Denver started out hot, as they led 33-22 after the first quarter and pulled out the rare wire-to-wire win. The Nuggets were clicking on offense all evening, shooting 56 percent from the field and assisting on 26 of their 50 made baskets. Rebounding was also key for Denver, as they won that battle, 41-35. The Nuggets also dominated in the paint, outscoring the Knicks, 68-32 in the interior.

New York (14-13) got some great performances from their stud players, but it simply wasn't enough with a lack of production from their ""others"". Carmelo Anthony led the team in scoring, as he tallied 29 points, four rebounds and three assists on 10-of-14 shooting. Kristaps Porzingis finished the game with 22 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Brandon Jennings got the start for the ailing Derrick Rose and amassed 14 points, seven assists and three steals in the loss. Guillermo Hernangomez was a nice spark off the bench, totaling 17 points and 10 rebounds. The Knicks return to action on Tuesday in a home matchup against the Indiana Pacers for their next game.

Denver (11-16) has now scored 259 points across their last two games and they hope it's the start of a special run. Emmanuel Mudiay had one of his best games of the season, accumulating 22 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the win. Nikola Jokic accrued 10 points, nine rebounds and five assists in just 20 minutes of action, as he battled foul trouble all game long. Will Barton and Kenneth Faried were huge off the bench, as they combined for 42 points, 15 rebounds, four assists and four blocks on 16-of-21 shooting. Denver will look to keep rolling on Monday in a home matchup against the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Golden State Warriors throttled the Portland Trail Blazers, 135-90, at Oracle Arena on Saturday.

Golden State was expected to have a monster output against this Portland defense and they didn't disappoint. Not only did they shoot 59 percent from the field, they assisted on 36 of their 51 made baskets. The Warriors were lights-out from long distance too, going 14-of-28 from three-point range in their blowout win. Rebounding was a huge factor for Golden State, winning that battle, 56-31. This was a wire-to-wire win for the Warriors, as they won every quarter by at least seven points.

The Blazers (13-16) have been one of the worst defenses in the league this season and a matchup with the Warriors is the last thing they needed. Damian Lillard did all he could for Portland, as he led the team with 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting. Maurice Harkless wasn't far behind Lillard, as he dropped 17 points on 7-of-15 shooting. No player on the roster had more than seven rebounds or five assists. Allen Crabbe was the best player off the bench, as he accumulated nine points, five rebounds and three assists. Portland's next game should be much easier, as they play the Sacramento Kings in a road matchup on Tuesday.

The Warriors (24-4) have been setting records on the offensive end this season and they only added to those numbers here. Kevin Durant was the player of the game, as he tallied 34 points, 11 rebounds and four assists on 11-of-13 shooting. Stephen Curry was second among the starters, as he accrued 19 points, three rebounds and six assists in just 27 minutes of play. Ian Clark was fantastic off the bench, scoring 23 points on 9-of-11 shooting. Draymond Green scored just three points on 1-of-4 shooting, but provided 12 rebounds and 13 assists in an impressive all-around performance. Scoring won't be as easy on Tuesday, as the Warriors host the Utah Jazz for their next game.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons, 122-108, at Verizon Center on Friday. 

As has often been the case this season, the Wizards' dynamic backcourt duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal spearheaded the offensive attack. The two guards combined for 54 points on 18-of-30 shooting, while Marcin Gortat provided his usual solid double-double performance. Washington had the hot hand collectively, as they posted stellar success rates of 57.9 percent and 48.0 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively, on their way to a season-high point total. 

The Pistons (14-14) were led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who posted 24 points, six rebounds, three assists and a steal. Reggie Jackson and Tobias Harris turned in a pair of 14-point efforts, with the former adding two assists and a rebound, and the latter supplying six rebounds, two assists and a steal. Andre Drummond posted a 13-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included an assist. As usual, Jon Leuer led the bench with 19 points, seven rebounds, five assists and a steal. 

Wall's 29 points paced the Wizards (11-14), a total that he complemented with 11 assists, two rebounds and three steals. Beal was right behind with 25 points, four dimes and a pair of boards. Gortat's 12-point, 14-rebound double-double also included four assists. Even Otto Porter, who's been struggling on the offensive end in recent games, registered 15 points to go along with eight boards and three assists. Markieff Morris, frequently facing off against brother Marcus, filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, four assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block. 

The Pistons head back home to face off with the Indiana Pacers on Saturday, while the Wizards also remain home and await the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday.

												The host Orlando Magic defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 118-111, at Amway Center on Friday. 

While these teams have struggled throughout the season, they left it all on the floor in this close fought battle. In fact, there were 15 lead changes and 15 ties, with no team leading by more than nine points. Orlando took advantage of their opportunities, as they took 14 more shots than Brooklyn. The reason for that were turnovers and offensive rebounding, as they won the turnover battle, 17-7, and the offensive rebounding, 13-6. Free-throws were also huge for Orlando, as they went 33-of-42 from the charity stripe, with Brooklyn committing 32 fouls. 

Brooklyn (7-18) has really struggled on the defensive end this season and a 118-point outing to the 29th ranked offense shows just that. Brook Lopez once again led the team in scoring, as he tallied 22 points, six rebounds and five blocks before fouling out in the final seconds. Jeremy Lin was second on the team, as he accrued 17 points, three rebounds and three assists off the bench. While Trevor Booker did snatch down nine boards, he went 0-of-5 from the field to score just two points. On deck for the Nets is a road matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.

Orlando (12-16) had lost six-straight home games coming into this matchup, so to say this win was needed would be a drastic understatement. Nikola Vucevic made his return from a back injury to drop 21 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three blocks off the bench. Evan Fournier also scored 21 points, adding four rebounds to his tally. Serge Ibaka may have been the most valuable player though, as he accumulated 18 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks in the victory. D.J. Augustin recorded 17 points, six rebounds and four assists as the starting point guard. Orlando will host the Toronto Raptors on Sunday for their next game.

Isaiah Thomas' presence had been missed by the Celtics (14-12) while he sat out four games with a groin injury. However, his return Friday provided a definitive spark, as he posted a game-high 28 points, along with five assists and three rebounds. Meanwhile, the Hornets (14-13) were dealing with the absence of their own star point guard in Kemba Walker, who missed Friday's tilt for personal reasons. While fill-in Ramon Sessions did a respectable job on the offensive end with 13 points, he had trouble containing Thomas, who shot a stellar 50 percent (10-of-20) from the field. Boston won the game with their second-half effort, as they erased a 50-41 halftime deficit by outscoring the visitors 55-38 over the third and fourth periods.

Nicolas Batum took up the offensive cause for Charlotte in Walker's absence, tallying a team-high 22 points and supplementing them with 10 boards, five assists and three steals. Sessions supplemented his aforementioned scoring total with six rebounds and six assists. Marvin Williams supplied 12 points, six boards and three dimes. Marco Belinelli led the bench with 11 points, while Jeremy Lamb collected 10 points in a reserve role also.

Al Horford was second to Thomas for Boston with 18 points, eight rebounds, five assists, five blocks and a pair of steals. Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder contributed a pair of 12-point efforts, with the former also providing seven boards, two assists and a steal, and the latter registering five boards and three assists. Jonas Jerebko led the second unit with nine points.

The Hornets will travel to Atlanta for a Saturday evening date with the Hawks, while the Celtics are off until Monday night, when they'll be in South Florida to face the Miami Heat.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Toronto Raptors, 125-121, at Air Canada Center on Friday.

The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Toronto win, but Atlanta had other ideas. In fact, the Hawks led for nearly every minute of this game, with the Raptors having their only lead in the first quarter. Both offenses were extremely efficient, as they each shot over 53 percent from the field. Atlanta dominated in the interior, as they won the rebounding battle, 44-28, and outscored Toronto, 62-46 in the paint.

Atlanta (13-13) has been struggling recently, but a 125-point outing on the road is just what the doctor ordered. Dwight Howard was the player of the game, as he totaled 27 points and 15 rebounds in the win. Dennis Schroder also played great, tallying 24 points, two rebounds and six assists. Tim Hardaway Jr. and Paul Millsap each provided 14 points, while providing solid defense. Kyle Korver finally got out of his slump, dropping 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting off the bench. Atlanta will be in action again on Saturday, when they host the Charlotte Hornets. 

Toronto (18-8) has been dominant on the offensive end this season, but a 121-point outing didn't quite get it done here. DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry once again carried the load, as they combined for 61 points and 10 assists. DeRozan led the team with 34 points, five rebounds and four assists, while Lowry provided 27 points and six assists. The other three starters combined for just 19 points, six rebounds and three assists. Cory Joseph was a nice spark off the bench, accruing 17 points, four rebounds and four assists. Terrence Ross and Patrick Patterson each dropped 10 points apiece off the bench as well. Toronto will return to action on Sunday in a road matchup against the Orlando Magic.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 95-69, at United Center on Friday.

Fresh off a double-digit home victory over the Bulls (13-13) on Thursday night, the Bucks (13-12) bounced back with an even more dominating effort Friday. Chicago's offense had no answer for a stifling Milwaukee defense that held them to a season-low scoring total, while also limiting them to a 30.4 percent success rate from the field. Giannis Antetokounmpo once again proved to be a thorn in the side of the visitors, leading the way with a 22-point, 11-assist double-double that also included seven boards, three steals and a block. 

Jabari Parker couldn't come close to his 26-point effort from Thursday, but he managed 12 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. John Henson and Tony Snell posted a pair of 10-point efforts, supplemented by four rebounds, a steal and a pair of blocks by Henson, to go along with five rebounds and a pair of dimes from Snell. Greg Monroe came off the bench to tally a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double over 23 minutes, while Mirza Teletovic compiled 13 points for the second straight night in a reserve role, and also hauled in eight boards.

A nightmarish outing for the Bulls saw Dwyane Wade pace them in scoring with a modest 12 points, which he complemented with five boards, an assist and a steal. Taj Gibson and Robin Lopez posted a pair of eight-point efforts on a combined 7-of-20 shooting, although they at least managed 11 boards between them. Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo had matching seven-point contributions as well, with the former also supplying seven boards, six assists and a steal, and the latter dishing out four dimes and recording four rebounds. Bobby Portis actually served as the second-leading scorer on the team despite coming off the bench, posting 10 points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes. 

The Bucks are now off until Tuesday night, when the Cleveland Cavaliers will come calling to the Bradley Center. The Bulls are home again Monday night, when the Detroit Pistons come to town.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies, 96-92, at FedEx Forum on Friday.

This appeared to be a lopsided matchup on paper, but the Kings pulled out the shocking road win. They really controlled the game from start to finish, as they led for the final 45 minutes and never trailed by more than two points. Both teams really struggled offensively, as they each shot below 39 percent from the field. Fastbreak points were the only big advantage for Sacramento, as they won that battle, 20-9. Memphis actually dominated many stats, as they took the advantage in rebounds, assists, steals and blocks in their defeat.

Sacramento (10-16) played this game without Rudy Gay (hip), but they still pulled out an unlikely road win. DeMarcus Cousins struggled all night, as he went 7-of-20 from the field and fouled out in the fourth quarter. With that said, he still led the team with 22 points and nine rebounds. Kosta Koufos was the hero, as he tallied 16 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks in his best game of the season. Garrett Temple got the start for Gay and finished with 17 points, six rebounds and four assists in a great fill-in performance. Darren Collison was the only other King in double figures, as he accrued 11 points, two rebounds and six assists. Sacramento will look to build off this win on Sunday in a road matchup with the Dallas Mavericks. 

Memphis (18-10) came into this game 9-0 in games decided by four points or less and they couldn't quite comeback here to improve on that number. Mike Conley (back) made his return from a three-week absence to provide eight points, three rebounds and six assists in 28 minutes. Marc Gasol led the team in scoring, as he dropped 20 points, six rebounds and four assists. Tony Allen was the only other starter in double figures, as he accumulated 16 points, nine rebounds and two steals in the defeat. Zach Randolph, Andrew Harrison and Troy Daniels also scored at least 10 points apiece off the bench. On deck for Memphis is a home matchup against the Utah Jazz on Sunday.

												The Houston Rockets notched their ninth straight win as they defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 122-100, at Toyota Center on Friday night. 

The Rockets made history in a couple of different ways in this contest, beginning with their nine-game win streak, which is their longest win streak in eight years. They also sank an NBA-record 24 three-pointers, while James Harden passed Hakeem Olajuwon, to become the Rockets' all time triple-double leader, as he notched his second straight triple-double, for the fifteenth of his career. 

Harden finished with 29 points on 7-of-15 shooting, along with 13 assists and 11 rebounds, in 34 minutes. Meanwhile, Eric Gordon notched a season-high 29 points on 10-of-17 shooting, including 7-of-12 from deep, in 28 minutes off the bench. The Rockets (20-7) shot 24-of-61 from long distance and tallied 27 assists in the game. They moved to 10-2 at home and will head out to Minnesota to take-on the Timberwolves on Saturday, for their second game in as many nights. 

The Pelicans (9-19) fell short on the second night of a back-to-back as they struggled shooting, going 40.8 percent from the field, 33.3 percent from long range and only 55 percent from the foul line. Anthony Davis scored 19 points before he was forced to leave the game in the third quarter with a leg contusion, and did not return.

												The Los Angeles Lakers came out victorious on the third outing of a seven-game road trip as they defeated the host 76ers in Philadelphia, 100-89, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday evening. 

The Lakers (11-18) broke an eight-game losing streak as they came together to defeat the 76ers (6-20). They jumped out to a great start, with a 30-18 first quarter and were able to hang tight for the rest of the game to improve to 5-11 on the road this season.

Five players scored in double figures to lead the Lakers to a much-needed victory. Julius Randle finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting, along with nine rebounds, four assists and three steals. Lou Williams struggled shooting, going 5-of-12 from the field and 1-of-6 from deep, but finished with 18 points, in 23 minutes off the bench, while D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young chipped in 15 points each. The Lakers shot 45.6 percent from the field, including 9-of-30 from long range, however gave up an ugly 20 turnovers in the game. They will go on to face the second night of a back-to-back as they take on the Cavaliers in Cleveland on Saturday.  

The 76ers dropped their second straight game as they fell short, shooting only 36.4 percent overall and 6-of-31 from long range. Joel Embiid and Jahlil Okafor started alongside each other for the second straight game and combined for 29 points and 12 rebounds, in less than 30 minutes each. Five players scored in double-digits for Philly, including Ersan Ilyasova, who chipped in 13 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. The Sixers fell to 4-13 at home with this loss, but will look to bounce back as they play host to the Nets on Sunday.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers took down the Miami Heat on Friday, 102-98.

The Clippers (20-7) took a 14-point lead by the end of the first half, but saw a scare as the Heat launched a comeback effort coming out of halftime. Los Angeles' saw strong play from its stars, however, en route to the victory. Forward Blake Griffin led the team with 20 points to go along with nine rebounds and four assists. Meanwhile, center DeAndre Jordan pulled down a ridiculous 19 rebounds in addition to 12 points scored. Chris Paul dished out only six assists, well below his average, but scored 17 points. The team shot only 43 percent and made just seven three-pointers, but was still able to score enough to win the game. The win was the team's fourth straight.

Miami (9-18) saw its struggles continue despite a valiant second-half effort on Friday. The team protected the ball exceptionally well, committing just four turnovers on the night. Despite being able to retain possession of the ball, the Heat had trouble putting it in the hoop consistently. Miami shot just 40 percent and hit only six three-pointers in the contest. Top performers for Miami were guard Goran Dragic, who scored 21 points and had an impressive 11 assists, and center Hassan Whiteside, who pulled down 17 rebounds.

The Clippers will visit Washington on Sunday, while the Heat will host the Celtics.

												The host Utah Jazz squeaked by the visiting Dallas Mavericks on Friday, 103-100.

Utah (17-10) has seen success early in the season despite being consistently hampered by injuries. Despite the absence of point guard George Hill (toe) and bench guard Alec Burks (ankle) in Friday's game, the Jazz were able to pull out the narrow win. A large portion of Utah's recent success has been thanks to star center Rudy Gobert, who has shot over 80 percent in the team's last six games en route to almost 17.0 points per game. Gobert has also been the anchor for an ironclad Jazz defense that is holding its opponents to a league-best 95.2 points per game. On Friday, Gobert led the team with 16 points and 10 rebounds, also notching a steal and a block. Despite relatively low scoring totals, the Jazz shot a red-hot 56 percent from the field and drained eight three-pointers.  

Injuries have also held back the Mavericks (6-20), who have had less success in overcoming their misfortune. The team remains without star Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles) and center Andrew Bogut (knee), and sits at the bottom of the Western Conference. On Friday, the Mavericks looked in need of more big man depth, as the team was out-rebounded 41-27. Dallas did see solid play on offense, as the team committed only six turnovers and had 12 three-pointers. However, the team shot only 46 percent overall and allowed the Jazz to hit at a significantly higher clip.

Dallas will host the Kings on Sunday, while the Jazz will visit Memphis to take on the Grizzlies.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 108-97, at Bradley Center on Thursday.

Although the final score would seem to indicate a fairly competitive contest, it belies the domination the Bucks (12-12) exercised over the Bulls (13-12) for most of the first three quarters. Milwaukee jumped out to a 30-18 lead after one quarter, had built up a 64-45 advantage by halftime, and held an 88-66 edge heading into the final 12 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker were too much for the Bulls, combining for 58 points. The hosts also shot 47.4 percent from the field and an outstanding 55.0 percent from three-point range, while eliciting 16 turnovers from their visitors as well. 

Jimmy Butler led the Bulls with 21 points, a total he supplemented with three assists, three rebounds and two steals. Dwyane Wade was next with 20 points, six assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Taj Gibson collected 19 points, four rebounds, an assist and a block. Robin Lopez (six points, six rebounds) and Rajon Rondo (five points, eight assists, five rebounds) weren't able to provide much on the scoreboard.

Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee with a stellar 30-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included three assists, three steals and a block. Parker was right behind with 28 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals. Matthew Dellavedova came within a hair of a double-double himself with nine points, nine assists and a rebound. John Henson mustered only four points but hauled in 10 boards, while Mirza Teletovic led the second unit with 13 points and a pair of assists.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Indiana Pacers, 102-95, at Smoothie King Center on Thursday. 

In a battle between two teams playing below expectations, the Pelicans escaped with a much-needed win. This game was tight throughout, as there were 11 ties and 10 lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 10 points. Rebounding was key for New Orleans, as they won that battle, 56-46. Three-point shooting really killed the Pacers, as they went 3-of-21 from long distance. 

Indiana (13-14) simply couldn't find their shots in this game, as they went just 41 percent from the field and 14 percent from three-point range. Myles Turner was a lone bright spot, as he led the team with 26 points and eight rebounds on 11-of-14 shooting. Jeff Teague wasn't far behind, finishing with 21 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. Paul George was the only other starter in double figures, as he accrued 18 points, four rebounds and four assists. Al Jefferson led the bench with 14 points and five rebounds. Indiana will return to action on Saturday in a road matchup with the Detroit Pistons.

New Orleans (9-18) has rode Anthony Davis all season long and he put in another spectacular performance here. Davis finished with 35 points, 16 rebounds and five blocks on his way to a monster performance. Jrue Holiday was also big, totaling 16 points, seven rebounds and 12 assists in the victory. Buddy Hield had one of his best games, dropping 21 points on 8-of-17 shooting. Terrence Jones recorded a double-double off the bench, totaling 10 points and 11 rebounds. The Pelicans play again on Friday, as they matchup with the Houston Rockets on the road.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 132-120, at Pepsi Center on Thursday. 

These are two teams that have struggled on the defensive end this season and it was clearly evident here in this 252-point game. The Denver offense was lights-out, as they shot 51 percent from the field, 89 percent from the free-throw line and 48 percent from three-point range. While the scoreline shows a 12-point spread, the Nuggets pulled out the rare wire-to-wire win, as the Blazers never looked like a threat. In fact, the Nuggets led by 25 at times in their win and the final 12-point difference was one of the lowest of the game. 

Portland (13-15) has been terrible on defense all year and this performance may be rock-bottom. Damian Lillard did all he could though, as he tallied 40 points and 10 assists in the defeat. C.J. McCollum also played well, accruing 23 points, three rebounds and four assists. Mason Plumlee was the only other Blazer in double figures, as he totaled 19 points, seven rebounds and four assists. The defense is unlikely to improve in the next game, as they face the Golden State Warriors on the road on Saturday. 

Denver (10-16) got a great team effort here, as their five starters combined for 81 points. Danilo Gallinari led the team in scoring, dropping 27 points, four rebounds and three assists on 8-of-13 shooting. Gary Harris had a strong showing in one of his first games of the season off a foot injury, as he amassed 18 points, four rebounds and six assists in the win. Wilson Chandler provided 17 points and eight rebounds of his own. Kenneth Faried, Jameer Nelson and Will Barton all scored in double figures off the bench. Denver's next game will be on Saturday, when they host the New York Knicks.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Phoenix Suns, 107-92, Thursday at Talking Stick Resort Arena.

The Spurs (21-5) managed to extend their league-best record away from home this season to 14-1, but it didn't come easy, as they held just a three-point lead going into Thursday's final period. From there, however, San Antonio put on a clinic, dominating the Suns in the 4th quarter 33-21. It was a balanced attack from the Spurs, with four of their five starters scoring in double figures and five players in total reaching double digits. Kawhi Leonard led the way, recording a double-double of 18 points and 10 rebounds, while Pau Gasol matched Leonard's 18 points and grabbed nine boards of his own. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 14 points, Tony Parker managed 11 points, while Dewayne Dedmon scored 11 points off the bench. For San Antonio, the game was won at the foul line, as the team hit 24 of their 26 attempts from the charity stripe (92.3 percent).

For the Suns (8-18), their fight only lasted three quarters because they couldn't get anything productive from their best offensive weapons. Eric Bledsoe, who had been averaging 31.0 points over his previous three games, shot just 5-of-14 from the field for 14 points in 30 minutes. His fellow starter in the backcourt Devin Booker didn't have a much better night, shooting 6-of-19 from the field en route to a team-high 17 points. As a team, the Suns shot a respectable 37 percent from behind the arc overall, but it was their shots inside the three-point line that doomed them, as they ended up shooting just 40 percent overall. 

Up next, the Spurs will head home Sunday to take on the Pelicans, while the Suns will have to travel to Oklahoma City on Saturday to play the Thunder.

												The host Golden State Warriors easily defeated the visiting New York Knicks on Thursday, 103-90.

The Warriors (23-4) hold the league's top record through 27 games now for the third straight season. It was a low-scoring night on Thursday for the league's top offense, but the Warriors still had no problem getting the win, outscoring the Knicks by 14 in the first half and holding on in the second. Golden State oddly got to the free-throw line only eight times on the night and made just half of their attempts. It was a dismal night from the line for both teams, as New York went 9-of-19 on free-throws as well. Aside from the line, though, Golden State shot well, hitting 46 percent of its attempts. Shooting guard Klay Thompson led the team with 25 points and had four three-pointers. It was a monster rebounding night for the Warriors, as they pulled down 57 boards. Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Draymond Green all pulled down double-digits in the rebounding column.

For the Knicks (14-12), forward Carmelo Anthony (shoulder) and guard Derrick Rose (knee) found themselves injured at an inopportune time. The Knicks' offense needed all the help it could get, as no starter scored more than 10 points. The team hit only 40 percent of its shots and had just five three-pointers. Sophomore star Kristaps Porzingis had an off night, scoring only eight points on 4-of-13 shooting to go with five rebounds. Bench guard Justin Holiday led the team with 15 points and also had an impressive five steals.

The Warriors will host the Trail Blazers on Saturday, while the Knicks will visit Denver to take on the Nuggets.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 123-114, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

The Raptors (18-7) came in to Wednesday hoping to extend their recent stellar run in rather comfortable fashion against what would have seemed like an overmatched Sixers squad. However, Philadelphia (6-19) came ready to defend their home court, and rolled out Joel Embiid and Jahlil Okafor together as starters for the first time this season. While both big men played relatively well, it was Robert Covington who exploded for a season-high 26 points, which he complemented with 12 rebounds and two assists. However, the dynamic duo of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan put on their usual impressive show for the Raptors, helping them overcome one of the Sixers' stronger offensive performances to date on the season. Philadelphia actually outpaced their visitors from the field by a 50 percent to 47.1 percent margin, and saw four of the five members of their first unit hit double digits in the scoring column. 

DeRozan led the way for Toronto with 31 points, five boards and three assists. Lowry was next with 20 points, seven assists and four rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas contributed a 17-point, 10-rebound double-double that also featured an assist, two steals and a block. DeMarre Carroll supplied 10 points, three boards, an assist and a steal, while Terrence Ross and Cory Joseph tallied a pair of 13-point efforts to lead the bench.

Okafor was second behind Covington with 17 points, four rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks. Sergio Rodriguez and Gerald Henderson put forth a pair of 16-point efforts, with the former adding five assists and a rebound and the latter also posting two assists and a steal. Embiid had a quiet night by his standards, registering nine points, six rebounds, five assists, two blocks and a steal. Ersan Ilyasova, who moved back to the bench with Okafor's insertion into the starting lineup at power forward, went for 12 points, seven rebounds and an assist to lead the bench. 

The Raptors head back home to face off with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night, while the Sixers remain home to face the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday evening as well.

The back-and-forth tussle between two relatively evenly-matched teams was undecided until the closing seconds, as both teams made respective strong pushes in the second half. The Hornets (14-12) had built a 54-49 lead by halftime, but the Wizards (10-14) stormed back in the third, winning the period by a 38-23 margin. Charlotte had their own resurgence in the final quarter, outscoring their hosts by 29-22 but still falling short, with a John Wall free throw in the waning seconds providing the final margin of victory. Both clubs saw their starting fives post very productive nights, with each team shooting over 51 percent overall.

The Hornets were led by Nicolas Batum, who tallied 20 points, eight assists, five rebounds, two steals and a block. Cody Zeller enjoyed a strong night at center, collecting 18 points, two rebounds, an assist and a pair of blocks. Kemba Walker came within a shade of a double-double with 17 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist contributed 11 points, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Marco Belinelli led the second unit with 16 points, a rebound and an assist, and Frank Kaminsky also contributed 10 points in a reserve role.

The Wizards received a 25-point, 10-assist double-double from John Wall that also included six rebounds and an outstanding seven steals, although he also turned the ball over eight times himself. Backcourt mate Bradley Beal was close behind with 20 points, nine assists and four rebounds. Marcin Gortat turned in a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double that also featured two assists, two steals and a block. Kelly Oubre, Jr. supplied 15 points, six rebounds, an assist and two steals while drawing a start for the ailing Markieff Morris (foot), while Otto Porter totaled 10 points, five rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. Jason Smith came off the bench to produce 12 points, seven rebounds, two assists and three steals in just 18 minutes.

The Hornets continue on the road and face the Celtics in Boston on Friday night, while the Wizards remain home and await the Detroit Pistons for a showdown on Friday evening.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Orlando Magic, 113-108, at Amway Center on Wednesday.

While there were a lot of stars in this game, it's some of the undervalued players who had career nights. Both Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers led their teams in scoring, as these are two teams that desperately need more contributions from their role players. Shooting was the difference for the Clippers, as they shot 50 percent from both the field and from the free-throw line. Despite this game being close throughout, the Clippers led for every minute after the first quarter. In fact, neither team held a double-digit lead, as there were just seven ties and four lead changes.

Los Angeles (19-7) is starting to recapture their early season form and road wins like this only add to their impressive resume'. Austin Rivers was the star, as he scored a team-high 25 points on 9-of-12 shooting. Blake Griffin wasn't far behind, as he tallied 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists. DeAndre Jordan had one of his best scoring games of the year, totaling 22 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks, while going 12-of-18 from the free-throw line. Chris Paul recorded a 16-point, 10-assist double-double. Los Angeles will return to action on Friday in a road matchup against the Miami Heat.

Orlando (11-16) has now lost six-straight games at home, as they continue to disappoint. Aaron Gordon did all he could though, dropping a career-high 33 points on 13-of-21 shooting. Evan Fournier accumulated 23 points and eight assists as the primary ball-handler for Orlando. Jeff Green was the only other Magic player in double figures, as he scored 19 points off the bench. Serge Ibaka and Bismack Biyombo both fell just shy of double-doubles, as they combined for 17 points and 20 rebounds in the defeat. Orlando's next game will be on Friday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers, 95-89, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday.

While these are teams that haven't quite lived up to expectations this season, they left it all on the floor here. Miami turned on the defense in the fourth quarter, as they held the Pacers to just 10 points en route to a comeback win. Indiana struggled all night from the field though, as they hit just 37 percent of their shots. Rebounding was huge for the Heat, as they won that battle, 58-38. In addition, Miami recorded 23 assists, while holding the Pacers to just 14. There were nine ties and 14 lead changes, as neither team led by more than seven points. 

Indiana (13-13) has been a bit of a disappointment this season and losses like this only add to the skepticism. Paul George struggled from the field, as he accumulated 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists on 8-of-22 shooting. C.J. Miles was second on the team, as he dropped 15 points off the bench. Myles Turner had a nice all-around game, amassing 11 points, seven rebounds, two assists and five blocks in the defeat. The Pacers will look to play better on Friday in a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans. 

Miami (9-17) has not had the results they want this year, but they continue to play well and wins like this only confirm that point. Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game, as he totaled 26 points and 22 rebounds on 10-of-16 shooting. Goran Dragic was the only other starter in double figures, as he tallied 11 points, five rebounds and six assists. The bench was huge, as Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson and James Johnson all scored in double figures. Tyler Johnson finished with 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and four blocks, while James Johnson accrued 14 points, three rebounds and six assists. On deck for the Heat is a home matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 107-97, Wednesday at Barclays Center.

The Nets (7-17) came into Wednesday's matchup as losers of five of their last six games, but were able to pull out a victory thanks to a pair of great performances from their starting wings. Bojan Bogdanovic scored a team-high 23 points, while Sean Kilpatrick added 22 points of his own. And while neither shot particularly well from the field, as they combined for a 11-of-26 shooting performance, they did excel at the free throw line, hitting 17-of-20 from the stripe. In fact, as a team, the Nets really struggled from the field overall, shooting just 38 percent overall. But again, they got to the line and hit their free throws, shooting 30-of-40 from the charity stripe, and it was those free shots that ultimately led them to victory.

The Lakers (10-18), on the other hand, managed to have an even worse night shooting than Brooklyn en route to their eighth straight loss, as Los Angeles shot 38 percent from the field themselves and a sorry 22 percent from behind the arc. On top of that, they shot just 68 percent from the free throw line. No Laker in particular stood out Wednesday, as Lou Williams led the team in scoring with just 16 points off the bench, while Timofey Mozgov posted a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. The Lakers just failed to be on the same page throughout Wednesday's contest, managing just 11 total assists to their 10 turnovers. 

Up next, the Nets will travel to Orlando on Friday to take on the Magic, while the Lakers will head to Philadelphia on Friday to play the 76ers.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 93-85, Wednesday at FedExForum.

The Grizzlies (18-9) were back to full strength Wednesday after the return of Marc Gasol (rest), but the Cavaliers (18-6) were not, as head coach Tyronn Lue elected to rest his big three of Kevin Love, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Without them, Cleveland, as expected, had a tough time getting anything going on offense and Memphis took advantage. The Grizzlies seized control of the game from the very start and never let up, led by their big man in the middle Gasol, who posted a double-double of 17 points and 11 rebounds. However, the biggest performance of the night came unexpectedly off the bench from Troy Daniels, who scored an efficient 20 points in just 22 minutes. As a team, Memphis shot just 43 percent from the field but were on fire from long range, hitting 12 of their 23 shots from behind the arc.

On the other hand, there wasn't much to take away from this game for the Cavaliers since they played without their three best players. Their two top scorers both came off the bench Wednesday, with veteran sharpshooter James Jones scoring a team-high 15 points and rookie Kay Felder adding a career-high 14 points. Overall, though, it was a miserable shooting night for Cleveland, as they shot just 37 percent from the field overall and 64 percent from the free throw line. On top of that, they managed just 10 assists to their 12 turnovers. 

Up next, the Grizzlies will stay home Friday to take on the Kings, while the Cavaliers will have off until Saturday when they play the Lakers.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 132-98, Wednesday at Toyota Center.

The Rockets (19-7) made sure this one was over fast as they cruised to their eighth straight victory and continue to be the hottest team in the NBA. Wednesday ended up being a breeze for Houston against a Kings team without DeMarcus Cousins (rest) and Rudy Gay (hip), as MVP-candidate James Harden posted a triple-double of 15 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds in 30 minutes. Ryan Anderson scored 22 points of his own, while Sam Dekker shined off the bench, scoring a career-high 19 points in just 22 minutes. Each other Rocket starter scored in double figures as the team shot a scorching 59 percent from the field and dished out 40 total assists.

For the Kings (9-16), things didn't go nearly as smooth without their two best players, as the team they put out on the floor could not keep up with the fast-paced Rockets. Garrett Temple got a spot start and scored a team-high 20 points in 30 minutes, while the next highest scoring total for Sacramento was Anthony Tolliver's 12 points on top of his 10 assists. The Kings struggled shooting from the field, managing to shoot just 42 percent overall, and they only managed to shoot 11 total free throws on the night. To make matters worse, the Kings have now lost six of their last eight games and the organization has little reason to be optimistic going forward. 

Up next, the Rockets will look to stay hot when they play the Pelicans in Houston on Friday, while the Kings will travel to Memphis on Friday to take on a surging Grizzlies team.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the host Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, 95-85.

Detroit (14-13) bounced back with the win after losing 97-79 to the lowly 76ers on Sunday. Wednesday's game went the opposite direction for the Pistons, in part due to their utter domination on the glass. The team held a 50-30 rebounding advantage and had 10 offensive boards. Big man Andre Drummond led the team with a whopping 17 rebounds, despite a marginal contribution on offense (three points, 1-of-3 shooting). Point guard Reggie Jackson led the team with 20 points, while forward Jon Leuer came off the bench for 19. The team shot an impressive 50 percent overall on the night.

Dallas (6-19) sits at the bottom of the Western Conference despite a six-game stretch of .500 basketball heading into Wednesday. The team struggled on offense in Wednesday's contest, shooting just 41 percent from the field. Only two Mavericks scored in double figures, as forward Harrison Barnes led the team with 19 points. Guard Deron Williams scored 16 and shot 9-of-9 at the line but was just 3-of-13 from the field. Williams also recorded a team-high five assists.  

The Pistons will play in Washington on Friday against the Wizards, while the Mavericks will head to Utah to take on the Jazz.

												The Utah Jazz blew out the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, 109-89.

Utah (16-10) remains plagued by injuries, as starting point guard George Hill (toe) and bench combo guard Alec Burks (ankle) remained out for Wednesday's game. This didn't seem to slow the Jazz down, however, as the team clicked on both ends of the floor. Utah shot a ridiculous 58 percent from the field and 56 percent from three-point range, including 13 makes. Sophomore shooting guard Rodney Hood led the team's offense with 25 points on 9-of-14 shooting and 5-of-9 from three. On defense, Utah was able to hold Oklahoma City to just 36 percent shooting and six three-pointers. Anchoring the team's defense was center Rudy Gobert, who recorded three blocked shots and 12 rebounds, both team highs.

For the second night in a row, the Thunder (15-11) and guard Russell Westbrook underwhelmed. Westbrook led the team with 27 points but shot an abysmal 7-of-25 from the floor with five turnovers. The guard also played below his averages on the glass and in the assist column, recording only six rebounds and five assists. Those numbers were also team highs, however, as the Thunder struggled to move the ball or crash the glass against Utah's tough interior lineup. The team shot only 36 percent and had just 14 assists on the night.

The Jazz will host the last-place Dallas Mavericks on Friday, while the Thunder will take on the Phoenix Suns on Saturday.

												The host San Antonio Spurs defeated the visiting Boston Celtics on Wednesday, 108-101.

The Spurs (20-5) hold the second-best record in the NBA and are within a game of the Warriors for the top seed in the Western Conference. On Wednesday, the team showed why that is, exhibiting a balanced approach on both ends of the floor. Reigning Defensive Player of the Year and MVP runner-up Kawhi Leonard led the team with 26 points on the night. Leonard hit 9-of-17 from the field and made all seven of his free-throws while also dishing six assists en route to victory. Though the Celtics appeared to make a comeback push, the Spurs managed to separate themselves in the fourth quarter, putting the game out of reach. With big man LaMarcus Aldridge sitting the game out, forward David Lee filled in as a starter, providing an important 10 rebounds to help San Antonio finish plus-three on the boards.

The Celtics (13-12), meanwhile, have lost three straight, but have also been missing All-Star Isaiah Thomas (groin). Guard Avery Bradley stepped up to fill Thomas's role a bit on Wednesday, leading the team with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists. Five Celtics finished with double-digit scoring, including bench guard Terry Rozier. In 25 minutes, Rozier scored 12 points and did not commit a turnover. The team saw solid ball movement, dishing 25 assists on the night.  

The Spurs will visit Phoenix on Thursday to play the Suns while the Celtics will host the Hornets on Friday in Boston.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 103-86, at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday.

The two teams square off again Wednesday night in Memphis in the second game of a home-and-home series, so the Grizzlies (17-9) opted to rest Marc Gasol on Tuesday. That left them even more short-handed than usual, given that star point guard Mike Conley is also out for the foreseeable future. That played right into the Cavs' hands, as they were able to put together a relatively comfortable home win despite sitting Kyrie Irving for rest purposes themselves. LeBron James and Kevin Love turned in their typical quality of performance, but the story was J.R. Smith, who'd essentially been mired in a month-long slump. The veteran guard posted a season-high 23 points on 8-of-17 shooting, including a stellar 6-of-10 tally from beyond the arc. Cleveland (18-5) shot 45.7 percent from the field overall, which helped them overcome 17 turnovers.

The Grizzlies were led by Zach Randolph, who started at center for Gasol. He posted 18 points, five rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Troy Williams and Andrew Harrison turned in a pair of 13-point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds and an assist, and the latter posting four assists, three rebounds, three blocks and a steal. Tony Allen contributed eight points, a rebound, an assist and three steals, while JaMychal Green only poured in two points but brought down eight boards. Jarell Martin supplied eight points, 10 rebounds and an assist.

Love led the way for Cleveland with 29 points, 13 rebounds, three assists and two steals. James registered 23 points, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals. DeAndre Liggins compiled three points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block while drawing the start for Irving, while Channing Frye led the second unit with eight points, a rebound and an assist.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 131-120, at Phillips Arena on Tuesday.

The Magic (11-15) had come in losers of three in a row, and were up against a Hawks squad that had shown some recent improvement by winning two consecutive contests after having lost seven straight. However, it was Orlando who snapped out of their doldrums Tuesday by posting a season-high scoring total. The most notable aspect of their outburst was that nearly half of their offense came from the second unit, with Elfrid Payton leading the way with career highs of 26 points and 14 assists, while adding three rebounds and a steal. That helped make up for a trio of single-digit scoring tallies from the starting five, as well as the absence of Nikola Vucevic, who missed the game with a back injury. 

Serge Ibaka paced the Magic on offense overall, contributing 29 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Evan Fournier was next on the first unit with 23 points, six assists, two steals and a block. Aaron Gordon and Bismack Biyombo generated a pair of seven-point efforts, with the latter also bringing down nine rebounds. D.J. Augustin (three points, three assists) only played 15 minutes despite starting at point guard, as Payton's performance dictated heavy minutes. Jodie Meeks (20 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals) and Jeff Green (16 points, four rebounds and an assist) rounded out the bench's stellar night.

The Hawks (12-13) saw all five members of the first unit hit double digits in the scoring column and were led by Dwight Howard's 20-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a block. Dennis Schroder supplied a 19-point, 13-assist double-double of his own, adding a rebound and two steals. Thabo Sefolosha and Paul Millsap tallied a pair of 17-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block, and the latter furnishing nine rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Tim Hardaway Jr. logged another start and parlayed it into 12 points, three rebounds and two assists. Kyle Korver continued his solid stretch of play off the bench, registering 12 points and a rebound over 27 minutes.

The Magic head home to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night, while the Hawks head north of the border to face the Toronto Raptors on Friday evening.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 99-94, Tuesday at United Center.

This game looked as if it was going to come down to the final moments and become a game of free throws, but Dwyane Wade managed to change all that after one possession. After attacking the basket and not getting a call, Wade complained to the official and ended up getting ejected from the game. The Timberwolves (7-18), who needed a miraculous comeback after being down as much as 21 points, sunk the free throws that came as a result of the fiasco and put the game firmly out of reach. The victory ended what was a four-game losing streak and came after the team had lost 11 of their previous 13 games. Zach LaVine led the way for Minnesota, scoring 24 points on top of six assists and six rebounds in a game-high 43 minutes. Andrew Wiggins was not far behind, posting 23 points and nine rebounds, while Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a double-double of 16 points and 12 rebounds.

For the Bulls (13-11), the loss ends a brief two-game win streak and makes for their fifth loss of the season against a team with a losing record. Jimmy Butler led the way for Chicago in his first game against his former head coach, Tom Thibodeau, scoring a game-high 27 points, but he did so on just 9-of-22 shooting from the field. Butler has, however, scored at least 26 points in each game he's played in during the month of December. The next highest scorer for Chicago was big man Robin Lopez, who scored 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting from the field. As a team, the Bulls shot a sorry 4-of-15 from behind the arc in defeat. 

Up next, the Timberwolves will look to build on their victory when they take on the Rockets on Saturday, while the Bulls will look to get back on track in Milwaukee on Thursday against the Bucks.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans, 113-109, at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday.

The records of these teams would indicate a lopsided result, but this game was tight until the final whistle. While there were only eight ties and 13 lead changes, neither team was able to grab a double-digit lead for the entirety of the game. The key for the Warriors was the assist-to-turnover ratio, with the Warriors recording 30 assists to 12 turnovers, while the Pelicans committed 17 turnovers to 26 assists. That's evident by the fact that Golden State took 13 more shots than New Orleans. 

Golden State (22-4) didn't have their best game here, but they escaped with a big road victory. Draymond Green was the second-lowest scoring starter, but accrued 12 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals en route to another triple-double. Stephen Curry led the team in scoring. dropping 30 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Kevin Durant wasn't far behind, as he scored 27 points on 10-of-19 shooting. The Warriors will look to keep rolling on Thursday, when they host the New York Knicks.

New Orleans (8-18) has struggled mightily recently, but losses like this against elite teams have to be encouraging despite the result. Anthony Davis did all he could, as he lead the team with 28 points, eight rebounds and five blocks on 10-of-14 shooting. Jrue Holiday went just 3-of-12 from the field, but accumulated 10 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four steals in the defeat. Langston Galloway was a great spark off the bench, tallying 20 points, five rebounds and three steals. Tim Frazier also played well off the bench, scoring 13 points and handing out eight dimes. On deck for the Pelicans is a home matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the New York Knicks, 113-111, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Tuesday.

While this game was tight throughout the final 15 minutes, it took some major swings to get there. In fact, New York went on a 22-6 run to start the fourth quarter to take an unlikely lead after trailing by 12 points headed into the fourth. There were only four ties and 11 lead changes, as Phoenix led for nearly 40 minutes of this game. Defense was key for the Suns, as they held the Knicks to 39 percent shooting and out-rebounded them, 61-43. 

New York (14-11) did a great job of fighting through adversity and coming back in this game, but it simply wasn't enough. Kristaps Porzingis carried the load, as he tallied 34 points, eight rebounds, three steals and three blocks before fouling out in overtime. Kyle O'Quinn was the Knicks second best player, accruing 22 points and 14 rebounds off the bench. Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose struggled mightily, as Anthony went 3-of-15 en route to 13 points, while Rose went 0-of-6 before exiting with back spasms. Things don't get any easier for New York, as they play the Golden State Warriors on the road for their next game. 

This marks the Suns (8-17) fifth overtime game this season, as they were able to prevail despite choking in the fourth quarter. Eric Bledsoe was the player of the game, as he accumulated 31 points, six rebounds and eight assists in the victory. Tyson Chandler continued his rebounding dominance, totaling 13 points and 23 rebounds. Marquese Chriss had his best game of the year, scoring 14 points and grabbing 12 boards. P.J. Tucker finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and three steals, while locking down Carmelo Anthony. Devin Booker had a game to forget, amassing just 12 points, one rebound and no assists on 3-of-16 shooting. On deck for the Suns is a tough home matchup against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday.

Portland (13-14) ran away with the game early, holding a 16-point lead by halftime. While no Blazer scored 20 points, the team saw well-rounded offense leading to 114 points on 53 percent shooting. Six Blazers scored in double digits, and center Mason Plumlee led the team with 18 points on an impressive 7-of-9 shooting. Portland's dynamic duo of guards, Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, scored a combined 32 points. Lillard also dished out nine assists.

Oklahoma City (15-10) had won seven of its last eight games heading into Tuesday's contest. However, All-Star guard Russell Westbrook, who had been averaging over 31.0 points with a triple-double heading into the game, faltered on Tuesday, posting just 20 points, six assists, and six rebounds. The guard shot only 7-of-19. While Westbrook's numbers still impressed, it was nowhere near the team-carrying performance that Oklahoma City needed, as the team shot just 38 percent from the field and had 20 turnovers. Guard Victor Oladipo was sidelined with an injury sustained during a game against Boston earlier in the week. His absence and Westbrook's struggles left the Thunder needing more offensively, but the rest of team was unable to provide adequate help.

The Thunder will play the Jazz on Wednesday, while the Blazers will face the Nuggets on Thursday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 110-94, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday evening.

The Pacers (13-12) have gotten increasingly healthier over the last week-plus, getting both Paul George and C.J. Miles back from injuries. At the same time, second-year big man Myles Turner has begun to blossom, providing Indiana with a much more well-rounded first unit. That was on display Monday, as George and Turner co-led the team with 22 points on a combined 18-of-34 shooting. Meanwhile, while Monta Ellis sat out the contest with a groin strain, Rodney Stuckey was able to provide a scoring lift off the bench in his stead, pacing the second unit with 14 points.

The Hornets (14-11) saw their first unit turn in lackluster showings overall. They were led by a pair of 13-point efforts from Marvin Williams and Nicolas Batum, with the former adding two assists, two rebounds and two steals while the latter hauled in 10 boards and dished out three assists. Kemba Walker generated a modest 12 points and supplemented them with five assists, two rebounds and two steals. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went for six points but did bring down 10 rebounds, and Marco Belinelli paced the second unit with 14 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. 

George complemented his 22 points with five rebounds, three assists and a steal, while Turner recorded seven boards, a steal and four blocks. Jeff Teague turned in a 16-point, 11-assist double-double that also included five rebounds and a steal. Glenn Robinson got the start for Ellis, but only provided three points, along with six rebounds, two assists, three blocks and a steal.  Thaddeus Young turned in nine points, five boards and an assist, while Miles was also productive off the bench with 11 points, two rebounds, an assist and a pair of blocks. 

The Hornets hit the road again to face off with the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night, while the Pacers head down to South Florida to face off with the Miami Heat on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 122-100, at Air Canada Centre on Monday. 

DeMar DeRozan has taken his game up to another level this season, and he's often been joined in many of his exploits by backcourt mate Kyle Lowry. However, Monday, it was another sharpshooting guard that helped supplement a team-high 30 points from DeRozan, as Terrence Ross came off the bench to pour in 25 points for Toronto (17-7). The pair went a combined 17-of-28 from the field, leading the Raptors to outstanding 50.6 and 56.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively.

The Bucks (11-12) got their own stellar 30-point performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo, who complemented his haul with eight rebounds, five assists and three steals. Jabari Parker was next with 27 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. However, only one other Bucks player managed to get into double digits in the scoring column, and that effort came from the bench in the person of Greg Monroe (11 points). Tony Snell (eight points), John Henson (seven points) and Matthew Dellavedova (two points) considerably underwhelmed on the first unit.

DeRozan added three rebounds and three assists to his team-high point total. Lowry went for 18 points, seven assists, three rebounds and a steal. DeMarre Carroll supplied 13 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal. Jonas Valanciunas registered an 11-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist. Ross supplemented his aforementioned bench-high scoring haul with five rebounds and two steals. 

The Bucks head back home and await the Chicago Bulls on Thursday night, while the Raptors head to Philadelphia for a Wednesday evening matchup with the Sixers.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Washington Wizards, 112-101, at American Airlines Arena on Monday. 

In a battle between two struggling teams, there were numerous swings, as it was clear both squads were desperate for a win. There were 10 ties and 11 lead changes in total, with no team leading by more than 11 points. Miami made the final most decisive swing, outscoring Washington, 31-19, in the fourth quarter. The Heat offense had one of its best games of the season, as they shot 51 percent from the field and assisted on 25 of their 45 buckets. The rebounding was a huge factor as well, with Miami winning that battle, 47-36.

Washington (9-14) continues to struggle this season and losses to teams like the Heat obviously doesn't help their cause. Bradley Beal and John Wall did all they could though, as they scored over half of the teams total points in this loss. Wall finished the game with 30 points, six rebounds and eight assists, while Beal accrued 29 points and four steals. The only other player on the roster in double figures was Markieff Morris, who amassed 10 points, five rebounds and three assists. On deck for Washington is a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday. 

Miami (8-17) has been playing much better than their record would indicate, so this sort of win can only add to their confidence. Goran Dragic had one of the most efficient games of the season, as he accumulated a season-high 34 points, five rebounds and five assists in just 31 minutes of play. Hassan Whiteside recorded another double-double, totaling 17 points and 16 rebounds in the win. Josh McRoberts had a nice all-around game, tallying seven points, eight rebounds and five assists.  The bench played well for Miami, with Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson and James Johnson all scoring in double figures. Miami will look to build off this win, as they host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday for their next game.

												The host Houston Rockets narrowly took down the visiting Brooklyn Nets on Monday, 122-118.

Houston (18-7) is one of the league's hottest teams, having won 12 of its last 14 contests. On Monday, the struggling Nets gave the Rockets a surprising run for their money; however, superstar James Harden was able to shoulder the load en route to victory. Harden scored 36 points and had eight rebounds and 11 assists as he led the Rockets offense to 17 three-pointers and 46 percent shooting. It was an uncharacteristically poor night for him at the line, however, as he shot just 8-of-12 on free-throw attempts. This seemed to be a theme for the entire team on Monday, as the Rockets hit only 58 percent from the line.

Brooklyn (6-17), meanwhile, finds itself in the opposite situation of Houston, having lost 12 of its last 14 games. The Nets have struggled mightily since an unexpectedly hot start in the season's opening week, though the team did see a positive in Houston as guard Jeremy Lin was able to play for the first time after suffering a hamstring injury earlier in the season. Lin saw 20 minutes of play time and had 10 points and seven assists. The Nets shot over 52 percent from the field as a team, but had turnover issues, committing 19 by the game's end.

												The Dallas Mavericks took down the visiting Denver Nuggets on Monday, 112-92.

Dallas (6-18) still remains at the bottom of the NBA, though Monday's win showed some promise for the struggling team. The Mavericks shot 58 percent from the field and 46 percent on three-point attempts. At the helm of this offensive attack was shooting guard Wesley Matthews, who posted a terrific 25 points on 10-of-14 shooting with five three-pointers. Forward Harrison Barnes scored 18 points, while point guard Deron Williams had 17 points and eight assists. The team protected the ball respectably, turning it over only nine times on the night.

Denver (9-16), meanwhile, saw shoddy offensive play in the crushing loss. The team shot just 42 percent from the floor and 28 percent from three-point range. Surprisingly, though, those issues did not stem from notoriously inefficient point guard Emmanuel Mudiay. Mudiay shot 6-of-12 and scored 17 points, the most of any Nuggets' starter. Sophomore big man Nikola Jokic also posted an efficient line off the bench, leading the team with a whopping 27 points and 11 rebounds on 10-of-12 shooting.

Dallas will host the Pistons on Wednesday night, while Denver will host the Trail Blazers on Thursday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 121-120, Monday night at Staples Center. 

In a game of runs, the game came down to who could make their free throws in the closing moments, with the Clippers (18-7) converting on just enough of their free throw attempts to hold off the Trail Blazers (12-14), who refused to go away, in the end. Fresh off his 20-point, 20-assist performance Saturday against the Pelicans, Chris Paul put together yet another impressive double-double, posting 21 points and 14 assists in 36 minutes. Blake Griffin led the way scoring for Los Angeles after missing the last game with knee soreness, posting 26 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. As a team, the Clippers were lethal from downtown, shooting 48 percent from long range. 

The Trail Blazers, however, were equally hot from behind the arc, shooting 48 percent themselves from three-point land. Regardless, they still fell a point short despite putting up an equally impressive performance overall. Their starting backcourt consisting of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combined to score 49 points, while starting center Mason Plumlee put together his best performance of the 2016-17 season, posting 18 points, seven rebounds, six assists and five blocks. Plumlee's performance put him in the same company as both Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo as the only three players to post such a stat line. 

Up next, the Clippers will head to Orlando Wednesday to take on the Magic, while the Trail Blazers will head home Tuesday and play the Thunder.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Los Angeles Lakers,116-92, at Golden 1 Center on Monday.

The Kings (9-15) came away with a blowout win to snap a three-game losing streak, but it took its toll on the home team, as they lost Rudy Gay (hip flexor) and Ben McLemore (quad) during the game. Before the two injuries, the physical battle between DeMarcus Cousins and Julius Randle caused Lakers (10-17) head coach Luke Walton to get ejected after arguing a controversial no call on Cousins. Both players went to the ground, and it appeared that Cousins had some part in pulling Randle down with him near the top of the key, off the ball. Los Angeles got some life following the ejection and used it to finish the half with a nine-point lead. DeMarcus Cousins bounced back on his own to lead the third quarter Kings surge, where the big man had a major part in outscoring the Lakers 39-13 during that period. Los Angeles had no response following the big scoring run for Sacramento. The Lakers are now on a seven-game losing streak. 

Cousins finished with 31 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, two steals and three blocks to round out his monstrous performance. The Kings all-star center went 12-of-21 shooting, including 2-of-3 from behind the arc. Darren Collison aided Cousins in the scoring department with 20 points, while Garrett Temple led the bench with 16 points. 

Louis Williams broke his streak of five straight games with at least 20 points after finishing with 14 points on 3-of-12 shooting in 26 minutes off the bench. D'Angelo Russell led Los Angeles and looked more mobile with the hindering knee injury slowly dwindling away, and finished with 17 points, two rebounds and four assists on 6-of-10 shooting. 

Both teams are on the road on Wednesday, as the Lakers visit the Brooklyn Nets and the Kings visit the Houston Rockets.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 97-79, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Sunday.

The Sixers (6-18) came in to the contest short-handed, as Joel Embiid was given the night off to tend to elbow inflammation, while starting point guard Sergio Rodriguez sat out with an illness. That opened the door for Jahlil Okafor and T.J. McConnell to enter the starting five, and both parlayed their opportunities into highly productive performances. McConnell came within an assist of a triple-double, tallying 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, while also adding three steals. Meanwhile, Okafor stepped up with 14 points, nine rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. The two players combined to go 12-of-18 from the field, and the Sixers shot an outstanding 55.9 percent from the field overall, keying what was only their second road win of the season. 

Robert Covington actually led Philadelphia in scoring, posting 16 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Ersan Ilyasova was right behind with 15 points, eight boards and a pair of steals. Nik Stauskas received some extra run off the bench as a residual effect of Rodriguez's absence, and he turned in 10 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal to lead the second unit. Nerlens Noel, making his season debut after recovering from a knee injury, was only able to log 10 minutes off the bench before being forced from the game with a sprained ankle. He supplied eight points and a steal during his time on the court. 

Marcus Morris led the offensive effort for the Pistons (13-13), registering a game-high 28 points and supplementing them with two rebounds, an assist and a block. Andre Drummond posted a 14-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included an assist and an impressive six steals. Reggie Jackson totaled 10 points, three assists, a rebound and two steals. However, Tobias Harris and Darrun Hilliard, who received the start in place of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (knee), only mustered a combined 13 points. Stanley Johnson, just recalled from the D-League, contributed six points, four assists, two rebounds and five steals.  

The Sixers return home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night, while the Pistons travel to Dallas to tangle with the Mavericks on Wednesday evening as well.

												The host Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Boston Celtics, 99-96, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday.

The Thunder (15-9) have won seven of their last eight after Sunday's contest. The team saw a scare early in the game as shooting guard Victor Oladipo hit the floor hard trying to contest a shot and was unable to return to the game after going to the locker room. Oklahoma City trailed for the majority of the game, but was able to launch a comeback in the game's final minutes on the strong play of Russell Westbrook. Westbrook scored a whopping 37 points on 14-of-26 shooting and pulled down 12 rebounds. Center Steven Adams, meanwhile, shot 7-of-8 from the floor and had 16 points with eight rebounds.

The Celtics (13-11) struggled once again due to the absence of All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas (groin). On Sunday, the team divided the scoring load very evenly, with four starters scoring in double-digits. Center Al Horford scored 19 points and pulled down four rebounds and had six assists. Fill-in point guard Marcus Smart scored 11 points and dished nine assists. The Celtics once again held a major disadvantage at the free-throw line, shooting only eight free-throws to Oklahoma City's 27.

The Thunder will play in Portland on Tuesday against the Trail Blazers, while the Celtics will travel to San Antonio on Wednesday to play the Spurs.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves, 116-108, at Target Center on Sunday. 

While Golden State did pull out the result most expected, it didn't come in easy fashion. In fact, the Warriors had to rally in a 38-20 fourth quarter to come back and win this game. The biggest factor was the assist-to-turnover ratio, with Golden State dishing out 30 assists to just eight turnovers, while Minnesota assisted just 17 times, while committing 14 turnovers. The Timberwolves lost this game despite winning the rebounding battle, 51-37. Free-throw shooting was also huge for the Warriors, as they went 27-of-30 from the charity stripe in their comeback win. 

The Warriors (21-4) are coming off their worst loss of the season, so a comeback win is all they could ask for to get right back on track. Klay Thompson led the team in scoring, as he dropped 30 points and six rebounds. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant each scored 22 apiece, as Durant added eight rebounds and five assists, while Curry provided four rebounds and nine assists. Draymond Green was the only other Warrior in double figures, totaling 18 points, five rebounds and four assists. Golden State will look to build off this win in a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday.  

The Timberwolves (6-18) have struggled all season and a meltdown like this to the best team in the league only adds to the troubles. Karl-Anthony Towns did all he could to keep the T'Wolves hanging around, as he tallied 25 points and 18 rebounds in the defeat. Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins also scored 25 points apiece, as the only other Minnesota players with at least 11 points. LaVine also added three rebounds and four assists, with Wiggins including five rebounds and two assists to his line. The Timberwolves next game will be on Tuesday, as they play the Chicago Bulls on the road.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 120-119, in overtime at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday. 

In a battle between two struggling teams, they left it all on the floor in this matchup. While there were only 12 ties and six lead changes, this game came down to the wire in an overtime thriller. Turnovers are what really killed the Suns, as they committed 16 of them, while forcing just 11 from the Pelicans. In addition, Phoenix really struggled shooting, as they hit just 65 percent of their free-throws and 34 percent of their three-pointers. The bench was also huge for New Orleans, as they outscored Phoenix, 62-43.

New Orleans (8-17) almost never wins with Anthony Davis struggling, but they did just that here. Davis still finished the game with 14 points and 12 rebounds, but went just 4-of-17 from the field. The hero was Tim Frazier, who tallied 14 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and five steals in one of the best games of his career. Jrue Holiday made a return from a three-game absence to lead the team with 23 points in 39 minutes. Reggie Williams led the bench in scoring, dropping 17 points in only his second game with the Pelicans. Unfortunately for New Orleans, they have to host the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday for their next game. 

Phoenix (7-17) got some great performances here, but they couldn't quite pull out a win against a hungry Pelicans team. Eric Bledsoe continued his splendid form, as he accumulated 32 points, three rebounds and eight assists in the defeat. Tyson Chandler had one of his best games of the season, totaling 14 points and 21 rebounds. Devin Booker was the only other starter in double figures, accruing 16 points, five rebounds and five assists. Leandro Barbosa led the bench in scoring, dropping 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting. The Suns will look to bounce back on Tuesday, as they host the New York Knicks for their next game.

												The New York Knicks defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 118-112, at Staples Center on Sunday. 

The Knicks (14-10) received the bulk of their offense from Derrick Rose and Kristaps Porzingis, as both made up for a rough shooting night from Carmelo Anthony. The neck-and-neck game never had one team clearly pulling away from the other, as a series of lead changes occurred in the third quarter. However, the Knicks came away with a nine-point lead to close out the third and went on to take charge of the fourth quarter as well. 

Porzingis was effective on both ends of the floor, scoring 26 points, to go along with 12 rebounds, two assists and seven blocks on 8-of-15 shooting. Rose (back) returned to action in Sunday's road contest and scored 25 points on 12-of-16 shooting, while Anthony struggled to find a rhythm on his way to 13 points on 16 shots. Brandon Jennings registered 23 minutes in his return to the bench, but was still effective with 19 points, three rebounds and four assists. 

Luol Deng and Louis Williams pulled the weight in the scoring department for Los Angeles (10-16), while D'Angelo Russell looked a bit off in his return to the starting lineup as well. Deng pitched in 22 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals on 8-of-13 shooting. Williams scored 24 points on 13 shots across 26 minutes. It was Williams' fifth straight game scoring at least 24 points, which also includes three games with at least 30 points. 

The Lakers will look to end their five-game losing streak when they face the Sacramento Kings in the second game of a back-to-back Monday, while the Knicks visit the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 110-105, at Verizon Center on Saturday.

The dynamic duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal has been leading the Wizards' successes all season, and Saturday was no different. John Wall and Bradley Beal combined for 44 points to lead Washington (9-13) its seventh home win. The Bucks (11-11) jumped on their hosts early, building a 32-23 lead after one quarter. The Wizards made up that deficit in the second quarter, and the two teams entered halftime knotted up at 52. The stellar performance from their guards helped overcome a typically spectacular one from Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokunmpo, who filled out the stat sheet with 28 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. Despite the defeat, the Bucks had the collective hot hand throughout the night, posting 50.6 and 52.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively.

Mirza Teletovic was Milwaukee's second-leading scorer and accomplished the feat from the bench, posting 25 points, three rebounds an a block over 26 minutes on 8-of-12 shooting, including 5-of-6 from the beyond the arc. John Henson was the only other member of the starting five with double-digit scoring, supplying 14 points (on 70 percent shooting), four rebounds and two blocks. Jabari Parker (eight points, four rebounds) and Matthew Dellavedova (six points, four assists, two rebounds) underwhelmed, but Malcolm Brogdon was strong in a reserve role with 11 points, two assists and a steal. 

Wall paced the Wizards with 24 points, 11 assists, four rebounds, two steals and a block. Beal followed with 20 points and six assists. Markieff Morris was strong down low, registering 15 points, nine rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block. Otto Porter, Jr. turned in another modest performance, going for 10 points, two steals, a rebound and an assist. His backup, Kelly Oubre, Jr. notably outshined him once again, pacing the second unit with 19 points, nine rebounds, an assist and three steals. Marcin Gortat contributed nine points but hauled in 14 boards.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Orlando Magic, 121-113, at Amway Center on Saturday.

In a game between two struggling teams, Orlando couldn't quite keep up in their fourth game in five nights. That was clearly evident late, as the Nuggets ended the game on a 17-5 run to pull off the comeback. While the defense struggled all night, Denver held Orlando to just 18 points in the fourth quarter, while scoring 29 points on their end. The Nuggets offense was on point, as they shot 57 percent from the field and recorded 25 assists in the victory. Rebounding was key as well, with Denver winning that battle, 44-31.

Denver (9-15) rode one of their best offensive performances here to an impressive road win. While no player on the Nuggets had more than 21 points, they had six players score at least 14. Danilo Gallinari led the team in scoring, tallying 21 points, six rebounds and three assists. Jusuf Nurkic scored 17 points and grabbed eight boards on 8-of-11 shooting in just 20 minutes of action. Kenneth Faried was huge off the bench, dropping 19 points and 10 rebounds on 9-of-10 from the field. Nikola Jokic and Juancho Hernangomez each scored 14 a piece off the bench. On deck for the Nuggets is a road matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. . 

Orlando (10-15) had to play this game without Nikola Vucevic and it clearly hurt their defense. Evan Fournier did all he could against his former team, as he led the Magic with 24 points, four rebounds and six assists. Serge Ibaka wasn't far behind, accumulating 22 points, four rebounds and four blocks in the defeat. Jeff Green was questionable coming in to this game with an ankle injury, but provided 17 points off the bench. Orlando's next game is on Tuesday in a road matchup against the Atlanta Hawks.

												The Indiana Pacers battled back from a 20-point first half deficit to defeat the visiting Portland Trail Blazers 118-111 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, on Saturday evening. 

After giving up 71 points in the first half the Pacers (12-12) battled back in the second half, earning their first lead of the game with 8:42 remaining in the fourth quarter. Portland (12-13) responded to retake the lead again but then Paul George went off, scoring 15 points straight over the final six minutes to lead the Pacers from a two-point deficit to a seven-point lead, which was enough to ice the game. 

Indiana's comeback is very impressive considering it was the second night of a back-to-back for the Pacers, who were also coming off the fifth game of a grueling road trip. Paul George finished with a season-high 37 points, while Thaddeus Young tied his season-high, with 24 points. Monta Ellis left the game in the third quarter with a groin injury and did not return. The Pacers move to 9-4 at home with the win and will look to keep it up as they host the Hornets on Monday.

Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combined for 67 points but no other player scored in double digits for Portland. The Blazers had trouble with turnovers, giving up 19 in the game. They led most of the game but fell apart in the fourth, where they were out-scored 28-13 in the quarter. Portland has lost three straight, while in the midst of a five-game road trip. The Trail Blazers go on to face the fifth and final game of their road trip as they face-off against the Clippers in Los Angeles on Monday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers came out strong on the second night of a back-to-back to defeat the Charlotte Hornets, 116-105, at Quicken Loans Arena on Saturday evening. 

LeBron James absolutely dominated the game as he broke-out for 44 points, along with 10 rebounds and nine assists, in 42 minutes. It marks the 73rd time in his career that James has scored more than 40 points. Meanwhile, the Cavs earned their fourth straight win, and snapped the Hornet's three-game win streak. 

The Cavs (17-5) got out to a strong start and led 67-52 at halftime. They tallied 19 assists in the first half alone, and finished the game with 25. Cleveland shot a blazing 57.5 percent from the field and 41.9 percent from long range, while LeBron James, Iman Shumpert and Kyrie Irving combined to go 11-of-19 from downtown. The Cavs are 11-2 at home and will look to add to their win streak as they play host to the Grizzlies on Tuesday. 

Hornets (14-10) will hope for the best as Kemba Walker left the game with about three minutes left in the fourth after suffering a left knee contusion. Walker was the high-point man for Charlotte with 24 points, in 30 minutes. Cody Zeller followed up with 17 points and nine rebounds. The Hornets did well to force 18 turnovers from the Cavs but still gave up 14 of their own. They will look to get back on track as they face the second game of a five-game road trip, on Monday in Indiana.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the visiting Miami Heat 105-100, at United Center on Saturday evening. 

After trailing by as many as 10 points in the fourth quarter, the Heat battled back to make it a one-possession game with 13 seconds to go. They then had a chance to go for the tie as they inbounded the ball, down by three with seven seconds remaining, however they fumbled the ball on a dribble-hand-off, turning it over and destroying their chances of a comeback. 

The Bulls (13-10) did a good job to hang-on for their second straight win. Jimmy Butler was the high-point man for Chicago, with 31 points, while Dwyane Wade came to play, as he dropped 28 points on his former team. The only other Bulls player to score in double digits was Taj Gibson, who finished with 13 points. The Bulls only shot 1-of-8 from long range but hit 28-of-31 free throws to help earn the win. The Bulls are now 7-3 at home and will look to keep it rolling as they play host to the slumping Timberwolves on Tuesday. 

The Heat (7-17) dropped their fifth straight game, however they have been hampered by injuries, and were missing Justise Winslow (wrist), Dion Waiters (groin) and James Johnson (shoulder) in this one. Hassan Whiteside and Goran Dragic combined for 41 points for Miami, while the bench came up large with 44 points, but it was still not enough to top the Bulls, who out-scored them by 17 at the foul line. After going 0-3 on their road trip the Heat will look to turn things around as they play host to the Wizards in a Southeast Division match-up on Monday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Golden State Warriors, 110-89, at FedEx Forum.

The Warriors (20-4) had rolled in to the Volunteer State riding high, with victories in 16 of their last 17 games. That impressive streak was harshly halted Saturday, however, as a defensive-minded Grizzlies squad managed to hold Golden State to a season-low point total. They also forced 23 turnovers from the Warriors, and held their dangerous long-range shooters to a collective 33.3 percent success rate from beyond the arc. While only Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry were able to post double-digit scoring for the visitors, the Grizzlies (17-8) countered with seven such performances, including one from each member of their starting five. 

Durant's relatively modest 21 points led the way for Golden State, a total he complemented with seven rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. Curry supplied 17 points, eight rebounds and three assists, going just 4-of-14 from three-point range in the process. Klay Thompson (eight points) and Draymond Green (seven points) underwhelmed, while Anderson Varejao went scoreless over 18 minutes in a start at center. Ian Clark's 10 points paced the second unit.

The Grizzlies saw Marc Gasol and Tony Allen lead the way with a pair of 19-point efforts, with the former adding eight rebounds, six assists, two blocks and a steal, while the latter supplied four rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. JaMychal Green was next with a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and a steal. Matching 11-point tallies from Andrew Harrison and Troy Williams rounded things out for the first unit, while Zach Randolph (14 points, seven rebounds, an assist) and Jarell Martin (13 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal) were strong in reserve roles.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 109-87, at Toyota Center on Saturday. 

This was a lopsided matchup on paper headed in and the Rockets left no doubt who the better team was. They got it done with a surprising recipe though, as they rode their defense to a win. In fact, they held Dallas to 40 percent from the field and 32 percent from three-point range. In addition, Houston won the rebounding battle, 48-32. Ball movement was a huge factor for the Rockets as well, recording 31 assists on 37 made baskets. Houston shot 50 percent from the field and 51 percent from three-point range. 

Dallas (5-18) has had a rough season and this loss just adds to those struggles. Wesley Matthews continues to revive his career though, as he led the team with 26 points, three rebounds and two assists. Harrison Barnes was second on the team, with 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Dwight Powell had a nice game off the bench, accruing eight points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals on a perfect 4-of-4 shooting. On deck for the Mavericks is a home matchup against the Denver Nuggets on Monday.

Houston (17-7) was expected to win this game fairly easily and they did just that by never trailing after the first five minutes. James Harden was once again the catalyst, as he tallied 18 points, nine rebounds and 16 assists, despite taking just 12 shots and making just four of them. Trevor Ariza provided 17 points and seven rebounds on 6-of-11 shooting. Clint Capela recorded another double-double, totaling 13 points and 10 boards. Eric Gordon was once again productive off the bench, scoring 18 points and handing out three assists. Houston has another favorable matchup for their next game, as they host the defensively-inept Brooklyn Nets on Monday.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 130-101, at AT & T Center on Saturday.

The Nets (6-16) have shown perhaps a bit more than was expected of them, even factoring in an injury to key offseason acquisition Jeremy Lin. However, most of their successes have come at home, as they entered Saturday with a 1-8 road record. Their futility away from Barclays Center unsurprisingly continued against the stingy Spurs (19-5), who elicited 16 turnovers from the visitors and held them to 41.4 percent and 25.9 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively. Kawhi Leonard also cut right through the heart of the Brooklyn defense, going for 30 points, six rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block. 

Brooklyn was led Bojan Bogdanovic's 20 points, which he supplemented with four rebounds and two assists. Brook Lopez was next with 14 points, five boards, five assists and a block. Trevor Booker contributed nine points, four rebounds and two assists, but Isaiah Whitehead and Sean Kilpatrick could only muster a combined 11 points. Luis Scola led the bench with a 15-point contribution, while Joe Harris registered 10 points in a reserve role as well.

Pau Gasol was second on the Spurs with 15 points, six rebounds, four assists and a block. LaMarcus Aldridge and Tony Parker contributed a pair of 12-point efforts, with the former also supplying nine rebounds, three assists and a block, and the latter compiling seven assists, a rebound and a steal. Patty Mills paced the second unit with 16 points over 16 minutes, while Jonathon Simmons was right behind him with 14 points.

The Nets continue remain in the Lone Star State and face off with the Houston Rockets on Monday night, while the Spurs are off until Wednesday night, when the Boston Celtics come to town.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Sacramento Kings, 104-84, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday.

Utah came into this matchup as a sizable favorite and they continued their great form with the defensive recipe that's carried them all season long. The fourth quarter is when they really turned it on, as they outscored Sacramento, 26-8. Utah also dominated down low, as they won the rebounding battle, 54-34, and recorded 10 team blocks in the win. The Jazz shot 48 percent from the field and 94 percent from the free-throw line. On the other hand, the Kings shot just 39 percent from the field and 54 percent from the charity stripe. 

Sacramento (8-15) had to play this game after a tough loss on Saturday and it clearly showed late. DeMarcus Cousins did finish the game with 16 points, 10 rebounds and four assists, but went just 7-of-22 from the field, as he was clearly frustrated by the Jazz defense. Rudy Gay led the team in scoring, dropping 20 points and five rebounds on 7-of-15 shooting. Darren Collison provided 17 points and two assists as the starting point guard or the Kings. Omri Casspi led the bench in scoring, accruing 12 points, five rebounds and two steals in the defeat. On deck for the Kings is a favorable home matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. 

Utah (15-10) continues to play shorthanded and they just keep adding wins to their tally. Fortunately, Gordon Hayward was able to return here from a finger issue, as he led the team with 26 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Rudy Gobert continued his stellar form, as he contributed 17 points, 14 rebounds and six blocks on 5-of-6 shooting. Joe Ingles got another start and provided 11 points, six rebounds and four assists. Trey Lyles was the only bench player in double figures, totaling 14 points and five rebounds. Utah will have some time off to get healthy before their next game, as they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 133-105 at Staples Center on Saturday. 

Both teams were shorthanded in the contest, however. The Pelicans (7-17) were without Anthony Davis (rest), Jrue Holiday (toe) and E'Twaun Moore (toe), making the game very one sided from the gate. The New Orleans reserves played physical basketball and found scoring lanes in the first half, falling just six points short of the Clippers (17-7) at the end of the second quarter. The second half was a different story, as Los Angeles outscored the Pelicans by 12 points in the third quarter and 10 points in the fourth quarter. Chris Paul dropped one of the biggest double-doubles of the season, racking up 20 points and 20 assists, with 18 of those assists coming in the first three quarters of action. 

Paul added five rebounds and three steals on 8-of-16 shooting in 30 minutes of action, which was even more helpful given Blake Griffin's (knee) absence. DeAndre Jordan worked the pick and roll with Paul to perfection, and with no Anthony Davis clogging the lane on the other end, Jordan found his way to 19 points and nine rebounds rather easily. Jamal Crawford and Marreese Speights added scoring help from the bench, as they finished with 22 points and 17 points, respectively. 

Tim Frazier led the Pelicans on the other end, scoring 20 points and adding 11 assists on 6-of-13 shooting. Buddy Hield drew 36 minutes and contributed 15 points on 2-of-5 shooting from behind the arc. 

Next up, the Pelicans play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Phoenix Suns, while the Clippers host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic, 109-88, at Spectrum Center on Friday. 

While the Magic (10-14) has generally played tough defense this season, their efforts on that side of the ball have often been undermined by a lack of offensive proficiency. The most recent example was Friday, when Orlando was only able to post 37.4 percent and 26.5 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively. Meanwhile, the backcourt duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum combined for 31 points on 13-of-24 shooting to spearhead a 48.2 percent tally for the Hornets (14-9), who pulled away with a 39-point third quarter.

Orlando was led by a modest 14 points from Evan Fournier, who added two rebounds. Serge Ibaka followed with 12 points, seven boards, three assists and a block. Aaron Gordon and Bismack Biyombo supplied a pair of nine-point efforts, while D.J. Augustin managed just eight points, two rebounds, an assist and two steals in 19 minutes despite drawing the start.

Matching 16-point totals from Nicolas Batum and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist paced the Hornets, with the former adding nine boards and seven assists, and the latter hauling in seven boards and dishing out an assist. Walker was close behind with 15 points, five assists and a steal. Cody Zeller registered nine points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal, while the bench was led by a pair of 12-point efforts from Jeremy Lamb and Ramon Sessions.

The Magic head back home to face the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night, while the Hornets head to Cleveland for a Saturday night showdown against the Cavaliers.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Miami Heat, 114-84, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday.

With a roster still missing James Johnson, Justise Winslow, Dion Waiters and Josh Richardson, the Heat (7-16) came in to Friday's matchup against NBA champs already behind the eight-ball. Miami fought valiantly in the first half, however, and the Cavs (16-5) only held a relatively modest 57-46 lead at halftime. However, they pulled away in the second half, outscoring the visitors by a 57-38 margin over the third and fourth quarters. Kevin Love, who had been a game-time decision with a back injury, led the way with a 28-point, 15-rebound double-double that also included three assists, a steal and a block. The Cavs had the hot hand as a team, posting a stellar 55.4 percent success rate from the field.

The Heat's first unit was led by Goran Dragic, who collected 15 points, four assists, three rebounds and a block. Wayne Ellington supplied 10 points, two assists and a rebound. Hassan Whiteside could only pour in eight points, but he did haul in 12 rebounds. Rodney McGruder and Josh McRoberts were only able to muster a pair of six-point efforts, with the former filling out the stat sheet with eight rebounds, five assists and two steals, and the latter registering four boards and four assists. The second unit was highly productive for Miami, with Derrick Williams pacing them with a team-high 17 points. Tyler Johnson pitched in with 12 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals in 38 minutes off the bench, while Willie Reed totaled 10 points and 11 boards in a reserve role as well. 

LeBron James checked in second behind Love against his former squad, posting 27 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and three steals. Kyrie Irving came through with 23 points, three assists and a rebound. Iman Shumpert led the second unit with 10 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal. Overall, the Big Three of Love, James and Irving impressively combined to go 32-of-55 from the field on the night.

The Heat next head to Chicago for a Saturday night date with the Bulls, while the Cavs await the Charlotte Hornets for a Saturday night showdown of their own.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Boston Celtics, 101-94, at TD Garden on Friday. 

In a battle between two Eastern Conference contenders, both squads left it all on the floor. The third quarter was the decisive one for the Raptors, as they outscored the Celtics, 33-18. In fact, Boston won or tied the other three quarters, but couldn't quite make the full comeback in the fourth. Defense was key for Toronto, as they held Boston to 37 percent shooting and forced them to fire up 42 three-pointers in their loss, making just 17 of them. The Raptors also won the points in the paint battle, 38-22, and won the fastbreak points, 14-5. Amazingly, the Celtics doubled up the Raptors in assists, winning that, 24-12.

Toronto (16-7) continues to ride their backcourt to wins and they did that yet again here. Kyle Lowry was the star in this one, tallying 34 points, seven rebounds and three steals. DeMar DeRozan wasn't far behind, finishing with 24 points and five rebounds on 9-of-25 shooting. Norman Powell got the start for the resting DeMarre Carroll and totaled 20 points, three rebounds and five steals on 7-of-10 from the field. Patrick Patterson and Jonas Valanciunas both failed to reach double figures in scoring, but snatched down 10 boards a piece. The Raptors are off until Monday, when they host the surging Milwaukee Bucks.

Boston (13-10) had to play this game without Isaiah Thomas and it really hurt them late when they needed a clutch basket. Al Horford did all he could to keep Boston hanging around, as he accumulated 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the defeat. Avery Bradley matched Horford with 19 points and five rebounds on 7-of-11 from the field. Marcus Smart and Jae Crowder really struggled shooting, as they combined to go 5-of-22 from the field. Boston will look to bounce back on Sunday in a road matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 114-110, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday.

The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Milwaukee win, but Atlanta made a huge comeback for a much needed victory. In fact, they trailed by 20 headed into the half and proceeded to outscore the Bucks, 70-46, over the final two quarters. Milwaukee actually led for over 42 minutes of this game, as Atlanta's only leads were in the first six minutes and final four minutes. The Hawks offense was extremely efficient, as they shot 48 percent from the field and assisted on 32 of their 40 made baskets. 

Atlanta (12-12) has really been struggling lately, but a comeback win like this could be the spark they need going forward. Dennis Schroeder was the catalyst of the comeback, as he dropped a career-high 33 points in the win. Paul Millsap was also huge, accumulating 23 points, 14 rebounds, six assists and three blocks. Tim Hardaway Jr. got a rare start and accrued 18 points, four rebounds and four assists in the win. Atlanta will be off until Tuesday, when they host the Orlando Magic for their next game.  

Milwaukee (11-10) has been playing some great ball recently, but heartbreaking losses like this are par for the course for such a young team. Giannis Antetokounmpo has carried this team on his shoulders all season long, but he totaled just 14 points, six rebounds and one assist, dealing with foul trouble throughout the game. Jabari Parker continued his great form though, tallying 27 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals in the defeat. The other three starters combined for just 20 points, as the bench did everything they could to hold onto this game. In fact, Michael Beasley, Michael Brogdon, Greg Monroe and Jason Terry combined for 49 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists on 20-of-35 shooting as the only four bench players to appear. Luckily for the Bucks, they return to action on Saturday in a road matchup against the Washington Wizards.

												The Houston Rockets escaped with a 102-99 victory over the host Oklahoma City Thunder, after a chaotic final few minutes at Chesapeake Energy Arena, on Friday. 

The Rockets led by as many as 13 in the fourth quarter before the Thunder went on a 13-2 run bringing the score to 94-92 for Houston with 3:20 to go. The final minutes were full of steals, turnovers, rebounds and all-out desperation, but the Rockets were able to come out with the win, evening the season series with Oklahoma City at 1-1.

James Harden led the way for the Rockets with 21 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, while his counterpart Russell Westbrook notched his seventh straight triple-double, with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists.  

Both teams struggled shooting, as the Rockets shot 39.1 percent overall and 26.2 percent from long range, while the Thunder shot 42.0 percent overall and 25.0 percent from long range. The Thunder won the match-up at the foul line, scoring 24 free throws, compared to 19 from the Rockets. Both teams also gave up a large amount of turnovers, while Russell Westbrook and James Harden each had eight on their own. All things considered it was not the prettiest game but the result is just as important nonetheless, given both team's battle for position in the West.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves 117-90, at Target Center on Friday night. 

The Timberwolves (6-17) saw their largest point-deficit of the season as they trailed by 35 points, 115-85 late in the game, on their way to their third straight loss. The Wolves struggled shooting from deep, going 3-of-16, as Andrew Wiggins who went 1-of-3 from downtown was the only starter to hit a three. Wiggins was the high-point man for Minnesota with 16 points on 6-of-16 shooting, while Karl-Anthony Towns followed-up with 14 points and 12 rebounds. All five starters scored in double digits but the Timberwolves only got 23 points out of seven players and a combined 91 minutes off the bench. Minnesota will have a tough time getting back in the win column as they play host Golden State on Sunday. 

The Pistons (13-12) did a great job with a 68-47 second half to secure their fifth road win of the season and split their two-game road trip. Andre Drummond notched his second straight 20 and 20 game, with 22 points and 22 rebounds, in 28 minutes. All five starters scored in double digits for Detroit, while John Leuer added 17 points off the bench. The Pistons shot 14-of-29 from downtown and 19-of-23 from the free throw line as they cruised to the win. Marcus Morris left the game late in the fourth after getting hit in the face. The Pistons will look to carry the momentum into Sunday, when they play host the 76ers.

												The host Dallas Mavericks showed no quit as they held on to defeat the travel-worn Indiana Pacers 111-103 at American Airlines Center on Friday evening. 

The Mavericks used a 34-13 run during the middle quarters, during which Wesley Matthews out-scored the entire Pacers team 16-13, to take the lead and did not look back, on their way to their fourth home win of the season and third win in their last seven games. 

Matthews was the high-point man for the Mavericks (5-17), finishing with 26 points on 8-of-16 shooting, including 5-of-10 from long range. Harrison Barnes followed up with 25 points on fantastic 10-of-17 shooting, along with eight rebounds and two assists. Deron Williams chipped in 16 points, while Dorian Finney-Smith added 12 points and eight rebounds. Dwight Powell had another solid game, with 14 points and five rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench. Things could be starting to look up for the Mavs, who had been pummeled by injuries early on but have shown improvement as guys like Williams and Devin Harris have returned. The Mavericks will face the second night of a back-to-back as they travel to Houston to take on the Rockets on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, despite shooting 14-of-25 from long range and 25-of-26 from the foul line the Pacers still came up short in their fifth and final game of a grueling West-coast swing. Paul George led Indiana with 22 points in the contest, while Myles Turners and C.J. Miles both chipped in 18. The Pacers fell to 3-8 on the road with this loss but will look to get back on track as soon as possible as they return home to face the second night of a back-to-back as they play host to the Trail Blazers on Saturday.

												The visiting Phoenix Suns defeated the injury-riddled Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, 119-115.

Phoenix (7-16) saw strong play from starting point guard Eric Bledsoe, who led the team with 30 points.  Bledsoe added nine assists and three steals in what was an impressive all-around performance.  The Suns' bench bolstered Bledsoe's strong play with a number of impressive outings.  Guard Leandro Barbosa scored 21 points and knocked down five three-pointers on the night.  Big man Alex Len, meanwhile, had a 14-point, 13-rebound double-double to go along with five blocks.  In addition to strong bench play, Phoenix saw excellent protection of the ball, as the team committed only seven turnovers in the game.

Los Angeles (10-15) has now lost five in a row and continues to struggle with injury.  Guards D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young were both sidelined by injuries during Friday's contest.  With minutes opening up in the backcourt, sixth man Lou Williams has seen an increase in production.  On Friday, this meant 35 points with six three-pointers for the former Sixth Man of the Year.  As a team, the Lakers pulled down an impressive 49 rebounds and were able to shoot 46 percent, but struggled with turnovers, committing 15.

The Lakers will host New York on Sunday, while the Suns will host New Orleans.

												The visiting New York Knicks defeated the host Sacramento Kings on Friday, 103-100.

Star forward Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks (13-10) with 33 points, including 12-of-14 from the free-throw line.  The game was a turnaround for the veteran star, as he posted only eight points in New York's blowout loss to the Cavaliers earlier in the week.  Sophomore star Kristaps Porzingis, meanwhile, managed 17 points despite hitting just 6-of-19 from the field.  Porzingis also recorded 10 rebounds on the night.  New York held a massive 54-39 advantage in rebounding overall.  11 of those boards came from bench big man Kyle O'Quinn, who also had eight points and five assists.

Sacramento (8-14) saw a team-high 28 points and 12 rebounds from All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins.  Cousins also dished out six assists, seemingly playing every role for Sacramento in the loss.  The team struggled from the field, hitting just 40 percent of its shots and going only 7-of-28 from three-point range.  The Kings also struggled on the boards, as no one other than Cousins recorded more than five rebounds.

The Knicks will visit the Lakers on Saturday, while the Kings will host the Lakers on Sunday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 124-110, at Air Canada Centre on Thursday.

Jonas Valanciunas has been toughing out an ankle injury in recent games, and the ailment had clearly affected his play before Thursday. However, the veteran big man bounced back against the Timberwolves, going for 20 points, 10 rebounds and an assist over 29 minutes. That effort served as an ideal complement to the production generated by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, who totaled 52 points. The trio of performances helped pave the way for a second 120-point plus performance in the last three games for the Raptors (15-7).

The Timberwolves (6-16) were led by Zach LaVine, who went for a game-high 29 points on 12-of-20 shooting, and who added six assists and two rebounds. Andrew Wiggins supplied 25 points, six rebounds and an assist while going 10-of-19 from the field himself. Karl-Anthony Towns contributed a 17-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a block. Nemanja Bjelica pitched in with nine points, three rebounds and a steal. 

DeRozan paced Toronto overall with 27 points, eight rebounds and five assists while visiting the foul line a game-high 13 times. Lowry was close behind with a 25-point, 11-assist double-double that also included a pair of rebounds and a steal.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Denver Nuggets, 92-85, at Verizon Center on Thursday.

In a game between two struggling teams, there was a lot of sloppy play in this game. In fact, there were 48 combined turnovers between the two teams and an NBA-high 29 turnovers committed by the Nuggets. Denver actually took an 11-point lead after the first quarter, but proceeded to allow Washington to win the other three quarters by at least five points each. Defense was key for the Wizards, as they held the Nuggets to 41 percent shooting and the aforementioned turnover total. Shooting was bad all-around for the Nuggets, as they went 67 percent from the free-throw line and 22 percent from three-point range. There were only two ties and six lead changes in total.

Denver (8-15) played this game without Emmanuel Mudiay and Kenneth Faried, as the offense really couldn't get anything going. Nikola Jokic was the lone bright spot though, leading the team with 17 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Danilo Gallinari was second on the team, with 13 points and four rebounds on 3-of-11 shooting. Jameer Nelson got the start for Mudiay and finished with 10 points, four rebounds and eight assists. Wilson Chandler had a nightmare game, going 2-of-16 from the field, en route to five points and eight boards off the bench. The Nuggets will look to play better on Saturday, when they travel to face the Orlando Magic.

Washington (8-13) have had to lean heavily on their starters all season long and all five players played at least 33 minutes in this tight win. Bradley Beal led the team in scoring, dropping 26 points, three rebounds and five assists. John Wall went just 5-of-14 from the field, but still tallied 15 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals in the victory. Markieff Morris also scored 15 points, adding three rebounds and four assists. On deck for Washington is a home matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 88-86, at FedEx Forum on Thursday.

The Grizzlies have been making a living off late-game execution and they added to their impressive resume' with this comeback win. In fact, the Trail Blazers were up 77-64 with seven minutes left, as the Grizzlies ended the game on a 24-9 run to win by two. Both teams struggled mightily on offense, with Memphis shooting 37 percent, while Portland hit just 30 percent of their shots. The Grizzlies made their presence felt down low, as they won the rebounding battle, 58-52, and outscored the Blazers in the paint, 40-26. 

Portland (12-12) were fortunate to hang around as long as they did in this game, as their 30 percent night was the worst of the season. C.J. McCollum was the lone bright spot in the offense, scoring 24 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Damian Lillard was second on the team, with 19 points on 6-of-18 shooting. Those two combined for just three rebounds and three assists in a frustrating night. Evan Turner got a rare start and recorded a double-double in the defeat, totaling 15 points and 10 rebounds. Ed Davis also provided a double-double, amassing 10 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. On deck for the Blazers is a road matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Saturday. 

Memphis (16-8) is now 9-0 in games decided by five points or less and this sort of resiliency is an impressive sight in the absence of Mike Conley. Marc Gasol continues to play out of his mind, as he scored a game-high 36 points on 13-of-24 shooting. JaMychal Green scored just six points on 2-of-8 shooting, but snatched down a career-high 18 rebounds in the win. Tony Allen recorded a double-double, accumulating 15 points, 10 rebounds and two steals. Newly-acquired Toney Douglas scored the final six points for Memphis, finishing with 11 points in the game. Zach Randolph, Troy Daniels and Andrew Harrison all struggled, combining to go 6-of-34 from the field. The Grizzlies will look to keep roaring on Saturday, when they host the Golden State Warriors for their next game.

												The 76ers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 99-88 Thursday at Smoothie King Center. 

The 76ers (5-18) used a dominant second half to pull away from the Pelicans (7-16) and end their eight-game winning streak. Philadelphia was once again led by Ersan Ilyasova, who scored a team-high 23 points on top of eight rebounds and four assists. Point guard Sergio Rodriguez had 16 points and eight assists, while Joel Embiid, who played after having two of the last three games off, scored 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds. And while the starters had a solid evening for the 76ers, it was their bench that really put them over the top, as the reserves combined to score 37 points Thursday night.

Meanwhile, it was another night to forget for the Pelicans, as the absence of both Jrue Holiday and E'Twaun Moore due to toe injuries ended up being too much for this offensively-challenged New Orleans team. Anthony Davis led the way for the team, but scored an underwhelming -- by his standards -- 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 41 minutes. The only other Pelicans player to score in double figures was Langston Galloway, who scored 19 points off the bench in 26 minutes. The other seven New Orleans players who saw action Thursday managed to combine to score just 43 points. With the loss, the Pelicans extended their losing streak to four games and they have now lost six of their last seven. 

Up next, the 76ers will look to earn their second winning streak of the season against the Pistons on Sunday, while the Pelicans will head to Los Angeles on Saturday to take on the Clippers.

												The Golden State Warriors beat the host Utah Jazz, 106-99, on Thursday.

The Warriors (20-3) remain the league's top team following their win in Utah.  It was an unusually slow night for the league's highest-rated offense, as the team scored just 41 points in the second half.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry led the team with 26 points, hitting three three-pointers and going a perfect 9-of-9 on the night.  Despite general struggles with rebounding, the Warriors were able to hold a 47-46 advantage on the boards in Utah.  Golden State shot an impressive 48 percent from the field on the night while holding Utah to just 41 percent.

The Jazz (14-10) were missing four of their five starters due to injury on Thursday.  Guards George Hill and Rodney Hood and forwards Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors have seen much of the early season marred by injury, and on Thursday all four were forced to rest.  Despite this, the Jazz were able to give the league-leading Warriors a run for their money.  Star center Rudy Gobert led the team with a whopping 17 rebounds, and also scored 20 points on 8-of-8 shooting.  Meanwhile, bench forward Joe Ingles scored a team-high 21 in 35 minutes.

Golden State will visit Memphis on Saturday, while the Jazz will host the Kings.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the San Antonino Spurs at United Center 95-91 on Thursday. 

The Bulls (12-10) dictated the pace of the game, despite a a torrid first half from Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade, the defensive effort from both teams was on display and the difference maker. The Bulls held the Spurs (18-5) to just 17 points in the first quarter and 15 points in the second quarter, and although the starters were far from performing well in the scoring department, they won the rebounding battle and moved the ball more effectively. 

Butler went on to finish with 13 points on 4-of-14 shooting, but also drew the matchup with Kawhi Leonard, who flashed defensive brilliance, contesting every attempt Butler went for. Wade went off in the second half and did most of his damage from the free throw line after finishing with 20 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the charity stripe. All five Bulls starters finished in double figures scoring, and Rajon Rondo had the best all around evening, finishing one assist shy of a triple-double. Rondo went for 12 points, 10 rebounds and  nine assists on 6-of-12 shooting. 

Leonard led the charge for San Antonio, although it was not enough to prevent their first road loss of the season. Leonard finished with 24 points, eight rebounds, five assists and one steal on 10-of-19 shooting. Pau Gasol converted a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds, while Patty Mills contributed 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting from the bench. 

Both teams play on Saturday, as the Spurs host the Brooklyn Nets, while the Bulls host the Miami Heat.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Detroit Pistons, 87-77, at Spectrum Arena on Wednesday.

The Hornets (13-9) have often counted on their standout guard combo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum this season to serve as the foundation of their offense, and their contributions came in particularly handy Wednesday against the Pistons (12-12). Andre Drummond posted a 26-point, 20-rebound double-double for Detroit that also featured an assist and a pair of blocks, but the Hornets' dynamic duo countered with a 25-point tally from Walker and a 14-point, 15-rebound effort from Batum. Despite the trio of remarkable performances, it was largely a defensive-minded contest, with both teams shooting under 40 percent from the field, and with the Pistons posting a particularly unsightly 14.8 percent success rate from behind the arc.

Tobias Harris was a distant second on Detroit with 14 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a block. Reggie Jackson continued to ramp up his minutes in his third game back from offseason knee problems, totaling 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block over 26 minutes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Marcus Morris had quiet nights on the scoreboard by their standards with a pair of seven-point contributions, but the  latter did haul in 10 rebounds. Jon Leuer headlined a modest outing for the second unit with six points, six assists and four rebounds. 

Walker added four assists, three rebounds and two steals to his game-high scoring haul, while Batum also dished out three dimes. Marvin Williams was back in the starting lineup after missing six games with a knee injury and supplied 12 points, five rebounds and a steal. Cody Zeller posted nine points, six rebounds and a block, while Marco Belinelli led the reserves with 13 points, five rebounds, an assist and two steals in 28 minutes.

The Pistons continue on the road and next visit with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday evening, while the Hornets remain home to face off with the Orlando Magic on Friday night as well.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Orlando Magic, 117-87, at Amway Center on Wednesday.

While this game was expected to be close, the Celtics took it to the Magic in this lopsided victory. Boston really put their foot down in the second half, outscoring the Magic, 68-37, after trailing by one headed into halftime. Shooting was the key difference, with Boston shooting 52 percent and Orlando shooting just 37 percent on their end. The Celtics dominated across the board, as they won the shooting, rebounding, assisting and turnover battles. 

Boston (13-9) had to play this game without Isaiah Thomas, but they didn't miss a beat. Avery Bradley stepped up in his absence, tallying 23 points, four rebounds and three assists. Al Horford scored just 10 points on 3-of-9 shooting, but added six rebounds and eight assists, as much of the offense was run through the big man. Jae Crowder recorded a double-double, accumulating 17 points and 10 rebounds. Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart took all the point guard minutes and combined for 29 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three steals in the win. The Celtics next game will be on Friday, when they host the Toronto Raptors. 

Orlando (10-13) has really struggled on offense this season and this 87-point effort only adds to those deficiencies. Nikola Vucevic did record a double-double off the bench though, totaling 12 points and 10 rebounds on 5-of-14 shooting. D.J. Augustin led the team in scoring, dropping 15 points on 4-of-7 from the field. The forwards really struggled, as Serge Ibaka and Aaron Gordon combined for just 13 points and 11 rebounds on 5-of-19 shooting. Evan Fournier went just 4-of-14 from the field, but accrued 14 points, three rebounds and five assists. On deck for the Magic is a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets, 116-111, at Barclays Center on Wednesday.

The Nets (6-15) likely left the visiting Nuggets (8-14) in a state of first-half shock, as they built a 68-52 lead by halftime. However, Denver, which had begun to show signs of regrouping in the second quarter, came out of the locker room much sharper, matching their hosts nearly point for point in the third quarter. They then exploded for 32 points in the final period, led by a standout effort from Wilson Chandler, who tallied a game-high 27 points off the bench over 35 minutes. Chandler clearly had the hot hand over starting small forward Danilo Gallinari, and also posted 15 rebounds and recorded a steal. He led a 70-point effort from the second unit on the night, which helped overcome three single-digit scoring tallies from the starting five. However, it was the Nets' Sean Kilpatrick who drew a foul from Chandler and sunk the two subsequent free throws with eight seconds remaining, sealing the hard-fought home win.

Will Barton led the Denver starters with 15 points, nine rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block, but did turn the ball over a game-high six times. Jusuf Nurkic pitched in with 11 points, three rebounds and an assist. On the bench, Jameer Nelson and Nikola Jokic managed a pair of 14-point efforts, with the former adding five rebounds, five assists and two steals and the latter contributing 11 boards, three assists and a block. Jamal Murray supplied 12 points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal in a reserve role as well. 

Brook Lopez led the way for Brooklyn with 24 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Kilpatrick was next with 22 points, six rebounds, three assists and a steal. Bojan Bogdanovic compiled 19 points, three assists and a rebound, while Trevor Booker continued his stellar play down low, posting a 15-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included five assists and a steal. Isaiah Whitehead drew the start at point guard and responded with 14 points, two rebounds, two assists, four steals and a block. Joe Harris paced the second unit with 16 points, two rebounds and two steals. 

The Nuggets next head to Washington to face the Wizards on Thursday night, while the Nets head to San Antonio for a Saturday night showdown with the Spurs.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Miami Heat, 103-95, at Philips Arena on Wednesday.

Atlanta was in desperate need of a win and they were able to take care of a shorthanded Miami team here. Defense was key for the Hawks, as they held the Heat to 42 percent shooting and forced them to commit 16 turnovers. Atlanta also dominated in the paint, winning the rebounding battle, 47-34, and outscoring them in the paint 58-26.The Hawks shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 27 of their 43 made baskets. This was a near wire-to-wire win for the Hawks, as Miami held just one lead in the first five minutes.

Miami (7-15) are as beat-up as anyone right now and it's taking a toll on the heavily used starters. Hassan Whiteside really struggled in this game, as he amassed eight points, 12 rebounds and one blocks on 4-of-12 shooting. Tyler Johnson was the team's best player, as he tallied 27 points and five assists off the bench. Goran Dragic continued his good form, scoring 21 points and handing out four assists. Rodney McGruder got the start for Justise Winslow and finished with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists. It doesn't get any easier for the Heat, as they play the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road for their next game. 

Atlanta (11-12) had lost seven-straight headed into this game, so to say this win was needed would be a drastic understatement. Dwight Howard took a lot of the load on his broad shoulders, as he tallied 23 points, 17 rebounds and four assists. It wasn't just offense though, as he held the dominant Hassan Whiteside in check. Paul Millsap also played great, accumulating 21 points, nine rebounds, four steals and three blocks in the victory. Dennis Schroeder was the only other player in double figures, accruing 17 points, four rebounds and seven assists.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 115-107 Wednesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center.

The Bucks (10-9) have now won five of their last six games as they continue to be one of the NBA's hottest teams. On top of that, Giannis Antetokounmpo continues to be one of the league's hottest players. The Greek Freak posted his second triple-double of the season and his third straight double-double, as he recorded 15 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists on top of four blocks and two steals. Fellow young star Jabari Parker scored a team-high 27 points, but it was a surprise offensive performance from Matthew Dellavedova that really pushed the Bucks to victory, as the Aussie scored 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field and played a crucial role in the team pulling away in the closing moments. 

For the Trail Blazers (12-10), they were once again led by their prolific starting backcourt of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. Lillard shined as he scored a game-high 30 points on top of seven rebounds and six assists, while McCollum wasn't too far behind, scoring 23 points and dishing out five assists of his own. Portland struggled to get many contributions from other players, although Mason Plumlee did manage to record his third double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes. 

Up next, the Bucks will look to continue their winning ways Friday against the Hawks, while the Trail Blazers with head to Memphis on Thursday against the Grizzlies.

												The Houston Rockets dominated the Los Angeles Lakers 134-95 Wednesday at Target Center.

This game appeared to be over after the first quarter, as the Lakers' (10-14) leaky defense had no answered for the Rockets' (15-7) high-powered offensive attack, as Houston won the quarter 43-27. And while Los Angeles managed to pull closer before halftime, the Rockets absolutely poured it on in the second half. 

Houston was led by shooting guard Eric Gordon, who has really adjusted to his new role off the bench, as he scored a game-high 26 points in just 24 minutes on a scorching 9-of-13 from the field. Early MVP-candidate James Harden was not too far behind, scoring 25 points on top of eight rebounds, six assists and four steals. To round off a terrific performance from the Rockets' backcourt players, Patrick Beverley put together his best performance since returning from injury, recording 10 points, 12 assists, seven rebounds and three steals in 32 minutes. As a team, the Rockets made a living at the 3-point line, shooting an impressive 15-of-36 from long range. 

For the Lakers, it was a night to forget, as the team shot a dreadful 39 percent from the field and 25 percent from behind the arc. Julius Randle led the way with a double-double of 21 points and 10 rebounds in 29 minutes, while Lou Williams continued to campaign for a Sixth Man of the Year award, posting an efficient 24 points in 25 minutes. Meanwhile, Jordan Clarkson made his first start at point guard this season and posted a lowly seven points on just 3-of-13 shooting from the field. 

Up next, the Rockets will head to Oklahoma City on Friday to take on the Thunder, while the Lakers will head home Friday to play the Suns.

												The visiting Cleveland Cavaliers demolished the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, 126-94.

For Cleveland (15-5), the win comes as a major shift of momentum.  The Cavs had lost three in a row headed into their matchup in Toronto on Monday, but have won twice this week on the road against stiff competition.  On Wednesday, the Cavaliers showed why they are the reigning champions, destroying the Knicks by 32 points to snap New York's four-game win streak.  The ""big three"" of LeBron James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving combined for 74 points and 15 assists, helping to lead the team to the blowout victory.  Big man Tristan Thompson, meanwhile, posted a goose egg in the scoring column but delivered a whopping 20 rebounds, including six offensive boards.  Despite the absence of sharpshooting guard J.R. Smith (knee), the Cavs hit 22 three-pointers while rolling to the easy win.

For New York (12-10), meanwhile, the loss brought the team's four-game win streak to an abrupt halt.  The Knicks saw below-average production almost across the board, as star Carmelo Anthony scored just eight points and rising star Kristaps Porzingis shot just 5-of-15.  While Cleveland shot almost 49 percent, the Knicks barely cracked 40 from the field.  New York also managed just half as many three-pointers as Cleveland did, hitting only 11-of-31 from beyond the arc. 

On Friday, the Cavs will host the Miami Heat while the Knicks will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings.

												The Sacramento Kings blew out the host Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, 120-89.

Sacramento (8-13) has struggled this season, though center DeMarcus Cousins has not.  'Boogie' has continued to play at an All-Star level and did so in Wednesday's win, scoring a team-high 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting.  Cousins added 14 rebounds and seven assists in what was an impressive all-around effort for the star big man.  Forward Rudy Gay, meanwhile, went 8-of-14 for 19 points while adding four assists and four steals. Sacramento showcased stellar ball movement, recording 28 assists on the night.  The team shot the ball exceptionally well, hitting 56 percent of its shots from the floor.

Dallas (4-17) has seen its worst start in years and remains just half a game above Philadelphia for the league's worst record.  Veteran star Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles) remains out, leaving a hole in the lineup for the injury-riddled Mavs. One bright spot, however, has been the resurgence of wing Wesley Matthews.  After an ice-cold start to the 2016-17 campaign, Matthews has seen a significant turnaround in recent weeks.  On Wednesday, Matthews scored a team-high 20 points on 6-of-8 shooting from the field and 5-of-5 from the free-throw line.  However, Matthews did commit four turnovers, a common theme for the Mavericks throughout the night.  The team committed 20 turnovers as a whole. 

On Friday, the Kings will host the New York Knicks and the Mavericks will host the Indiana Pacers.

												The Phoenix Suns dropped their third straight as they fell 109-94 to the visiting Indiana Pacers on Wednesday evening at Talking Stick Resort Arena.

Despite facing the second night of a back-to-back, the Suns started out strong and led 53-49 at the beginning of the second half, but the Pacers went on to win the final two quarters, including a 27-14 fourth quarter. 

The Pacers (11-11) did well to grind out the win as they faced the fourth game of their current five-game road trip. Despite coming off a monumental 142-106 loss in Golden State on Monday, Indiana bounced back to earn their third road win of the season.  Paul George was the high-point man for Indiana, with 25 points on 8-of-18 shooting and 8-of-10 from the foul line. George also added 13 rebounds and three steals to round out his stat line. Myles Turner gave the Pacers a boost early and finished the game with 20 points, while going 7-of-11 from the field. Jeff Teague went 1-of-4 from long range but finished with 19 points and 11 assists. The Pacers will look to make it two straight wins as they take on the struggling Mavericks in Dallas on Friday.

The Suns (6-16) came out with a competitive first half but were out-scored 60-41 in the second half. They drop to 3-6 at home with this loss, which also marks their seventh loss in their last ten games. Despite being back at full strength after a few injuries early in the season, the Suns have yet to pull it together. They had six players score in double digits but no one with more than 15 points as they fell short at home on a night when they needed to take advantage of a travel-worn opponent. The Suns will look to bounce back as they take on the Lakers in Los Angeles on Friday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 115-98 at Staples Center on Wednesday. 

The rivalry match went in favor of the Warriors (19-3), even though Stephen Curry struggled on the floor of Staples Center again this season. Regardless which Los Angeles team gets put on the court, Curry is a surprising 4-of-28 across three contests this season. Kevin Durant also had one of his worst games in a Warriors jersey, but the team effort led by Klay Thompson's 24 points and the Clippers 39.6 percent shooting from the field was more than enough to hold a 20 point lead throughout most of the game. 

After a Draymond Green three-pointer and a Curry and-1 layup with 2:10 left in the first quarter, Golden State went up by 15 points and did not have to look back. The closest the Clippers (16-7) came was seven points following a Chris Paul jumper midway through the third quarter, which cut the lead to seven points, but Green, Durant and Curry ripped off a quick scoring run to put the game out of reach. 

Thompson finished with 24 points, four rebounds and three assists, Curry scored 19 points but failed to make a three-pointer on eight attempts and Durant went 5-of-17 from the field on his way to 16 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Green had the best all around performance after scoring 22 points and grabbing five rebounds, in addition to four assists and two steals on 8-of-10 shooting. 

Jamal Crawford provided 21 points off the bench to lead all Clippers scorers, but Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin combined for just 37 points on 41 shots from the field. The weak showing from the Los Angeles starters sank their hopes of pulling out a win against their rivals, and have now dropped five of their last seven games. 

Next up, the Warriors play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Utah Jazz on Thursday, while the Clippers host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards, 124-116, at Verizon Center on Tuesday.

Just a few games ago, the Magic (10-12) were in the midst of a forgettable stretch where they lost five of six contests. However, after some tinkering with the starting five, they've started to find the right balance and hit their stride. Never has that been more evident than Tuesday, when they exploded for a season-high point total. It was notably the second unit, which includes a pair of former starters in Elfrid Payton and Nikola Vucevic, that carried the night for Orlando, as they combined for a whopping 73 points. That superb effort helped overcome a herculean performance from the Wizards' John Wall, who went for a season-high 52 points. Payton actually led the way for Orlando overall, posting a team-high 25 points and supplementing that total with nine assists, a rebound, three steals and three blocks over 35 minutes on the court. It was a season-high point total for the point guard, who'd posted three straight single-digit scoring outings prior to Tuesday. 

The second- and third-highest scorers for the Magic were also on the second unit, with Jeff Green compiling 20 points, three rebounds and a steal. Jodie Meeks was next with 18 points, two rebounds and an assist in just 16 minutes off the bench. Bismack Biyombo posted a 14-point, 13-rebound double-double that also featured two assists and three blocks. Evan Fournier and Serge Ibaka registered a pair of 10-point efforts, with the former posting three rebounds and an assist, and the latter supplying five rebounds, an assist and four blocks. Vucevic managed a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double on the second unit as well. 

Wall added eight assists, four rebounds and three steals to his game-high scoring haul. Bradley Beal was a distant second on the Wizards (7-13) with 19 points, three rebounds and three assists. Markieff Morris tallied 10 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a block. Otto Porter (seven points) and Marcin Gortat (six points) turned in modest offensive totals, but the latter did also haul in 11 rebounds, along with an assist, a steal and a block. Marcus Thornton led the second unit with a full stat line of eight points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal.

The Magic head back home to face off with the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night, while the Wizards remain home to face the Denver Nuggets on Thursday evening.

												The New York Knicks defeated the host Miami Heat, 114-103, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday.

These two teams totaled nine ties and 17 lead changes, as there was swing after swing in this tightly contested battle. Defense was key for New York, as they held Miami to 43 percent shooting. The Knicks shot 49 percent on their end and outrebounded the Heat, 53-46. 

New York (12-9) has finally been starting to gel over recent weeks and they received some big performances in a big road win. Carmelo Anthony was the player of the game, scoring a game-high 35 points on 13-of-27 shooting. Kristaps Porzingis recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points and 12 rebounds. Derrick Rose finished the game with 10 points, two rebounds and three assists before leaving early due to back spasms. Joakim Noah had one of his best games as a Knick, accruing 10 points and 10 rebounds in just 14 minutes of action. On deck for New York is a home matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday. 

Miami (7-14) are starting to play better, but they ran into a hot Knicks bunch that didn't want to lose. Goran Dragic continued his fantastic form, accumulating 29 points, four rebounds and seven assists in the loss. Hassan Whiteside recorded yet another double-double, amassing 24 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks. Wayne Ellington was the only other starter in double figures, dropping 14 points. Tyler Johnson did provide 13 points and five rebounds off the bench. Miami will play again on Wednesday, as they travel to Atlanta to face the Hawks.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Chicago Bulls 102-91 at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday. 

The Pistons (12-11), who used a big fourth quarter to pull away from the Bulls (11-10) on Tuesday, are now winners of four of their last five games and look to be trending in the right direction with the return of their point guard Reggie Jackson, who played in his second game of the season since returning from a knee injury. Jackson, however, was again placed on a minutes restriction, playing just 18 minutes, but he still managed to record seven points and seven assists in the outing. It was Tobias Harris who led the way for Detroit, recording a game-high 22 points on top of seven assists in 40 minutes, while Andre Drummond posted a double-double of 15 points and 10 rebounds in just 25 minutes. As a team, the Pistons didn't have a great night from the field, shooting just 45 percent, but they did play very efficient basketball, as they dished out 24 assists to just nine total turnovers. 

For Chicago, they continue to reel, as they have now lost three in a row and four of their last five games. Despite that, Jimmy Butler continues to have a breakout offensive season, as he posted 32 points, six rebounds and four assists in 43 minutes Tuesday and has now scored at least 26 points in four straight games to start the month of December. Beyond Dwyane Wade's 19 points, there weren't any other admirable performances against Detroit, as the rest of the starters combined to score just 29 points, while the bench managed to produce a measly 11 points. As a team, the Bulls made just two of their 15 3-point attempts and recorded just 15 assists to their 14 turnovers.

Up next, the Pistons will travel to Charlotte on Wednesday to take on the Hornets, while the Bulls will look to turn things around Thursday at home against the San Antonio Spurs, who remain a perfect 12-0 on the road.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 96-91 Tuesday at FedExForum. 

While the Grizzlies (15-8) were able to walk away with a five-point victory, they were one shot away from the game heading to overtime, as 76ers (4-18) shooting guard Nik Stauskas had a wide open 3-point attempt to tie the game at 94 with about five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Stauskas made just one shot from behind the arc in 38 minutes Tuesday, and luckily for Memphis, that wasn't one of them. 

Marc Gasol led the way for an injury-plagued Grizzlies team with a double-double of 26 points and 12 rebounds in 34 minutes, and while the rest of the Memphis starters struggled to put together solid outings, the team's bench more than made up for that, with the five reserves posting 38 of the team's 96 points. The most important contributor of the bench mob, Zach Randolph, made his return to the floor after missing the last seven games due to the loss of his mother and posted a double-double of 12 points and a team-high 14 rebounds. 

For the 76ers, they got a big performance out of starting power forward Ersan Ilyasova, who did everything he could to keep Philadelphia in the game against a big and tough Grizzlies frontcourt. Ilyasova finished the game with 23 points and 17 rebounds -- his fourth double-double since he joined the 76ers. The man who he replaced in the starting lineup, Dario Saric, had yet another great night, posting 17 points and seven rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench. In the end, Philadelphia left far too many points at the free throw line, as they shot a dreadful 13-of-26 from the stripe. 

Up next, the Grizzlies will stay at home Thursday to take on the Trail Blazers, while the 76ers look to notch their first road victory of the season Thursday at New Orleans against the Pelicans.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs beat the Minnesota Timberwolves, 105-91, on Tuesday to remain undefeated on the road. 

San Antonio (18-4) is undergoing a polar shift from their 2015-16 campaign in which they went an NBA-record 40-1 at home.  This season, the Spurs have been the league's most dominant road team, winning all 13 contests they have played outside of San Antonio.  Oddly enough, the team sits at just 5-4 at home this season.  On Tuesday, the Spurs made winning look easy, securing a double-digit win against the host Timberwolves.  Forward Kawhi Leonard had 31 points on impressive 11-of-15 shooting to lead the team.  Despite being out-rebounded, San Antonio was able to easily beat Minnesota thanks to lights-out shooting.  The team shot over 52 percent from the floor in the game.

Minnesota (6-15) remains near the bottom of the league for the third straight season despite the blossoming of some young talent.  Center Karl-Anthony Towns had a career-high 47 points last week, and guards Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins have been averaging career-highs in scoring.  LaVine led the way for Minnesota with 25 on Tuesday, though the Spurs were able to keep the other Wolves contained.  Towns and Wiggins scored 11 each, and Towns shot just 3-of-16 on the game.  As a team, Minnesota struggled, shooting under 44 percent from the field. 

The Wolves will visit Toronto on Thursday, while the Spurs will play in Chicago.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Phoenix Suns 112-105 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Tuesday. 

The Jazz (14-9) claimed their third straight victory and have won seven of their last eight contests. Gordon Hayward added another 20-plus point performance, contributing 28 points on 8-of-16 shooting. Rudy Gobert flashed another brilliant game on both ends of the floor, which has been a major reason for Utah's winning ways of recent, as he scored 22 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and racked up four blocks in 38 minutes. The bench was led by Sheldon Mack, who scored 12 points and dished out four assists in 30 minutes of action. 

Devin Booker was the lone bright spot for the Suns in the loss, as he scored 21 points on 9-of-13 shooting. The resurgent, but streaky Booker, is still maturing in his young career, but when he is on he caused multiple mismatches for the Jazz. Three bench players found double figures for Phoenix, as Alex Len, Leandro Barbosa and Brandon Knight all amassed 20-plus minutes and 10-plus points. 

Next up, the Suns host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, while the Jazz host the Golden State Warriors.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 106-98, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday.

The Nuggets (8-13) checked in to Monday's contest having recorded four of their seven victories on the road, and they found a way to continue their success away from home against a Sixers (4-17) squad missing starting small forward Robert Covington (knee/illness). Danilo Gallinari led the way with 24 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. He got to the foul line a game-high 12 times, converting 11 of those opportunities into points. His effort keyed a 46.1 percent effort from the field overall from the Nuggets, who snapped a three-game losing streak.

Barton checked in right behind Gallinari with a full stat line of 22 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Jusuf Nurkic was only able to provide a modest eight points but did haul in 10 rebounds. Emmanuel Mudiay and Kenneth Faried combined for just six points, but Jamal Murray led the bench with a 22-point effort that also included three rebounds and two assists and helped make up for the scoring void overall. Wilson Chandler was also productive in a reserve role, tallying 10 points.

The Sixers were led by a pair of 17-point efforts from Ersan Ilyasova and Sergio Rodriguez, with the former adding eight rebounds, two assists and two steals and the latter supplying seven assists, four rebounds and three steals. Joel Embiid posted 16 points, four boards and an assist, while Gerald Henderson poured in 14 points and added five rebounds, three steals and an assist. Dario Saric paced the second unit with 17 points, eight rebounds and a steal, and Richaun Holmes registered 11 points, eight rebounds, an assist and two blocks. 

The Nuggets will continue on their Northeast trek and visit the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, while the Sixers hit the road on Tuesday to take on the Grizzlies.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Toronto Raptors, 116-112, at Air Canada Centre on Monday.

The Cavs (14-5) came in to Monday's contest facing their first crisis of the season, having lost three consecutive games for the first time in the current campaign. However, as has been the case during their time together, Cleveland's Big Three of Kyrie Irving, LeBron James and Kevin Love stepped up their collective game, combining for 86 of Cleveland's 116 points. Fittingly, it was James, the elder statesmen of the group, who led the way, tallying 34 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. The stellar efforts helped lead to 47.6 and 43.8 percent tallies from the field and three-point range, respectively.

Love was equally spectacular to James in many respects, posting a 28-point, 14-rebound double-double. Irving totaled 24 points, seven assists and two rebounds. Tristan Thompson contributed a modest six points, but did also bring down 14 rebounds and also recorded an assist and posted a pair of blocks. Channing Frye led the bench with 10 points, five rebounds and two assists. 

The Raptors (14-7) saw their dynamic duo of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan step up with their own impressive performances, with the latter's 31 points, which were supplemented with five assists, four rebounds and three steals, pacing the offense. Lowry managed a near double-double with 24 points, nine assists, three rebounds and a steal. Jonas Valanciunas continued to battle a sore ankle to total four points and 10 rebounds. DeMarre Carroll and Pascal Siakam were only able to combine for 14 points, but Terrence Ross (14 points, a rebound, an assist and four blocks) and Patrick Patterson (12 points, nine boards) helped make up for the scoring void off the bench.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 118-113, at Barclays Center on Monday. 

Brooklyn came out hot, as they scored 66 first-half points en route to a 15-point lead. The Wizards then responded by winning the third quarter, 32-15. There were 18 ties and six lead changes, as this game came down to the final seconds. Turnovers are what killed the Nets, as they committed 21 of them, while forcing just nine. The Wizards actually recorded 17 steals in their victory. 

Washington (7-12) was expected to win this game rather easily, but it took a huge comeback effort to pull it out. John Wall led the team in scoring, tallying 25 points, 13 assists and three steals in the victory. Bradley Beal and Otto Porter were second in the team, recording 18 points and four rebounds a piece. Marcin Gortat recorded a double-double, totaling 10 points and 12 rebounds. Beal, Wall, Porter and Markieff Morris combined for 13 steals. Washington will look to build off this win, as they host the struggling Orlando Magic on Tuesday for their next game.  

Brooklyn (5-15) choked away a big lead in this game and that's indicative of their recent form, as they've now lost 10 of their last 11 games. Brook Lopez carried the load for Brooklyn, accumulating 25 points, six rebounds, five assists and three blocks in the defeat. Sean Kilpatrick wasn't far behind, amassing 21 points, six rebounds and four assists of his own. Trevor Booker totaled 14 points and 14 rebounds as the starting power forward. On deck for Brooklyn is a home matchup against the Denver Nuggets  on Wednesday.

												The visiting Charlotte Hornets defeated the host Dallas Mavericks, 109-101, on Monday.

The Hornets (12-9) needed the win badly after having gone 4-6 in their previous ten games.  Monday's matchup was among the easier on the Hornets' schedule, as Dallas sits near the bottom of the league standings.  Still, Charlotte saw a hard-fought game, with the team's lead in single digits as the game neared its end.  Guard Kemba Walker led the team with 19 points on 8-of-15 shooting, but had just three rebounds and four assists.  Nicolas Batum, meanwhile, recorded 14 points and an impressive 15 rebounds from the shooting guard position.  Batum also dished out a team-high seven assists.

Dallas (4-16), meanwhile, sits only half a game above the league-worst 76ers following Monday's loss.  Dallas has been heavily depleted by injury early this season, most notably to veteran star Dirk Nowitzki (achilles).  On Monday, starters Dorian Finney-Smith and Andrew Bogut combined for just 35 minutes and one point, showcasing the dire state of Dallas's roster.  Newly acquired forward Harrison Barnes, however, led the team with an impressive 29 points.  Barnes has stepped up in his larger role with Dallas after spending years as a fourth option on offense in Golden State.

The Hornets will host the Pistons on Thursday while Dallas will host the Kings.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Atlanta Hawks by a score of 102-99 on Monday at Philips Arena.

It was another win for the Thunder (14-8) and another triple-double for superstar point guard Russell Westbrook. Westbrook finished Monday's game with 32 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in 33 minutes, and he had the triple-double fulfilled halfway through the third quarter. It was Westbrook's sixth straight triple-double and his 11th in 22 games this season as he continues to be more explosive than he ever has in his career. Coincidentally, not only was it Westbrook's sixth straight triple-double, but it was also Oklahoma City's sixth straight victory.

The Hawks (10-12), on the other hand, are headed in a much different direction than the surging Thunder, as they have now lost seven in a row and 10 of their last 12 games overall. Monday's loss came despite the fact that Paul Millsap returned to the starting lineup after missing three games with a hip injury and led the team in scoring with 24 points on top of five rebounds and five assists. Dennis Schroder managed to add 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds, but the other three Atlanta starters scored a combined 12 points, with starting small forward Kent Bazemore failing to score a single point. Even so, the Hawks fell just short in the end, playing catch up in the closing moments when it was just too little too late. 

Up next, the Thunder will look to notch their seventh straight win against the Rockets on Friday, while the Hawks will look to end their win drought Wednesday when they take on the Heat.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 112-110, at United Center on Monday. 

This game was expected to be close and the teams didn't disappoint. There were 12 ties and 13 lead changes in total, with no team leading by more than 10 points. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the biggest difference, with Portland recording 25 assists to nine turnovers, while Chicago committed 15 turnovers to just 16 assists. The Trail Blazers also dominated the shooting, hitting 48 percent from the field and 39 percent from three-point range. The Bulls shot just 42 percent from the field and 30 percent from long distance. Portland somehow won, despite being outrebounded, 50-38. 

Portland (12-10) have been regressing recently, but a road win here could give them the spark they need. Damian Lillard once again carried the load, tallying 30 points, four rebounds and seven assists. C.J. McCollum wasn't far behind, totaling 24 points and five assists. Allen Crabbe was huge off the bench, scoring 17 points and grabbing five boards. On deck for the Blazers is a road matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday.

Chicago (11-9) was without starting point guard Rajon Rondo, who sat out due to a suspension, but backcourt mate Dwyane Wade stepped up with a game-high 34 points to go with four rebounds and four assists in the defeat. Jimmy Butler was the only other starter in double figures, accumulating 26 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Robin Lopez scored just six points as the starting center, but grabbed 14 rebounds and swatted away two shots. Nikola Mirotic was a nice spark off the bench, accruing 18 points and seven rebounds. Chicago will return to action on Tuesday in a road matchup against the Detroit Pistons.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 97-96 Monday at BMO Harris Bradley Center.

It was a remarkable comeback effort for the Spurs (17-4), who, after scoring just 35 points in the first half and just nine in the second quarter, used a terrific second-half effort to earn the victory and improve to a perfect 12-0 on the road this season. Overall, San Antonio outscored Milwaukee (10-9) by 14 points in the second half and their run was topped off by a game-winning layup from LaMarcus Aldridge, who finished with 18 points, nine rebounds and five assists, with just over 20 seconds remaining. Kawhi Leonard led the way for the Spurs, scoring a team-high 21 points and grabbing nine rebounds of his own, while Pau Gasol posted 15 points and nine boards. It was a matchup won in the frontcourt for the Spurs, as the only other San Antonio player to reach double figures was Dewyane Dedmon, who finished with 10 points and six rebounds off the bench. 

For the Bucks, they were led once again by their young stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Antetokounmpo 22 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and two steals, while Parker managed 23 points, eight rebounds and two assists. The rest of the Bucks starters, meanwhile, combined to score just 20 points, and it was the contributions from Milwaukee's reserves that kept them ahead, with Greg Monroe posting a double-double of 10 points and 13 rebounds and Mirza Teletovic scoring 11 points off the bench. The Bucks could potentially get themselves into trouble as the season goes on if they don't have a legitimate scoring option after Parker and Antetokounmpo, as teams will focus more and more on the young stars with both putting together stellar seasons. 

Up next, the Spurs will look to win their 13th straight on the road when they take on the Timberwolves on Tuesday, while the Bucks will stay home Wednesday and play the Trail Blazers.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans, 110-108, on Monday.

Memphis (14-8)  saw a huge performance from star center Marc Gasol in Monday's win.  Gasol scored 28 points, including a three-pointer that sent the game into overtime, while also posting a triple-double.  The big man had 11 rebounds, 11 assists, and added two blocks and two steals.  Gasol was just one piece of a major rebounding effort for Memphis, as forward Jeff Green and guard Tony Allen had 15 and 14, respectively.  The team finished with 61 rebounds and ended plus-seven on the glass.  Guard Troy Daniels, meanwhile, had a career night off the bench, scoring 29 points and knocking down 7-of-11 attempts from three-point range.

New Orleans (7-15) continues to slide, having lost five of its last six contests.  The four-game win streak that the team saw after the return of Jrue Holiday seems a relic of the past now, as the Pelicans sit near the bottom of the Western Conference standings.  The losing comes despite the monstrous play of All-Star forward Anthony Davis.  The 23-year-old leads the league in scoring at over 31 points per game, and is also among the league's top five rebounders.  On Monday, despite having played 43 minutes the night before, Davis logged 48 minutes and scored 28 points while pulling down a game-high 17 rebounds.  The impressive effort was not enough to get it done, however, as his team still trailed on the glass and ultimately was outscored.  

Memphis will host Philadelphia on Tuesday, while the Pelicans will also see Philadelphia on Thursday.

												The host Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Boston Celtics, 107-106, on Monday.

Houston (14-7) saw a major advantage at the free-throw line, shooting 31 foul shots as a team.  All-Star James Harden shot a perfect 18-of-18 at the line en route to a team-high 37 points.  Houston led by as much as 12 early in the game but held a double-digit deficit at points in the fourth quarter.  The Rockets were able to shoot their way back into a nail-biter, as the game was decided by a missed layup from Boston's Al Horford at the buzzer.  Houston hit 12 three-pointers on the night, helping to maintain the its average as the top three-point shooting team in the league.  

Boston (12-9), meanwhile, struggled early in the game, allowing Houston to take a double-digit lead in the first quarter.  The Celtics were able to turn the game around with a 19-2 run early in the third, eventually gaining the lead.  However, Houston's three-point shooting ended up costing the team down the stretch.  All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas suffered what appeared to be a groin injury in the first half, but remained on the floor and finished the game.  Thomas did see a dip below his normal production as a result, however, as he shot just 7-of-18 for 20 points.  Center Al Horford, meanwhile, scored 21 points and dished nine assists despite ultimately missing the game-winner. 

The Celtics will visit Orlando on Wednesday, while Houston will host the Lakers.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 107-101 at Staples Center on Monday. 

The Jazz (13-9) edged out a close victory down the stretch after the Lakers (10-13) found life late in the second half. The see-saw third and fourth quarters saw scoring runs in favor of Utah in the third, while the Lakers bounced back in the fourth behind Lou William's streaky scoring bursts and Julius Randle's explosiveness under the rim. Williams dropped in a two point shot to close the Jazz lead to three point with 3:26 remaining in the final period, but Rodney Hoot responded for Utah with a 25-foot three pointer. The Lakers only managed two points over a three minute stretch, while Utah closed out the game. 

Williams finished with 38 points, six rebounds and seven assists on 13-of-27 shooting to lead all scorers in his 34 minutes off the bench. Worth noting was the Lakers starting lineup, which consisted of Brandon Ingram, Luol Deng, Metta World Peace, Julius Randle and Timofey Mozgov. Head coach Luke Walton was experimental with the lineup, and it seemed to funnel the Jazz into more isolation style basketball, which was the game plan as discussed in the post-game press conference. 

All five Utah starters finished in double figures scoring, led by Gordon Hayward and his 23 points. Rudy Gobert finished with 14 points, 17 rebounds and five blocks in 39 minutes. 

Next up, the Jazz play the second game of a back-to-back when they host Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, while the Lakers travel to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Indiana Pacers 142-106 at Oracle Arena on Monday. 

Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes and led the Warriors (18-3) to an incredible rout of the Pacers (10-11) to grab their ninth home win of the season. The remarkable scoring effort started early and had Oracle Arena rowdy for the three quarters of play in which Thompson dominated from every square inch of the court. Golden State racked up 80 points by the half, and took a 30 point lead into the third quarter, where Thompson added 20 more points to the 40 points he scored in the first half. The Pacers simply had no answer for Thompson, even when they finally switched Paul George onto the hot shooting guard after he broke the 50 point mark. 

Thompson’s final line was 60 points, two rebounds and one assist 21-of-33 shooting including 8-of-14 from behind the arc and 10-11 from the free throw line. Kevin Durant added 20 points, eight rebounds and four assists on 14 shots, while Stephen Curry scored 13 points on 2-of-7 shooting from deep. 

As for the Pacers, the game was out of reach from midway through the second quarter, and the defensive effort and game play focuses on Curry and Durant. Paul George led Indiana with 21 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and one steal on 4-of-12 shooting. 

Next up, the Pacers visit the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Warriors visit the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Detroit Pistons, 98-92, at Palace at Auburn Hills on Sunday. 

The Magic (9-12) embarked on their current road trip as losers of four in a row, and appeared like a team in disarray all the way around. However, they've found a way to turn things around away from the confines of Amway Center, as they've now managed to rattle off victories in four of their last five games, including three straight. Serge Ibaka played a pivotal role in Sunday's win, as he posted a team-high 21 points and added seven rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals. The performance was an extension of a resurgent stretch by the veteran forward, one in which he's posted double-digit scoring efforts in nine of 10 games and multiple blocks in seven of his last nine. Orlando has also developed a strong second unit in the the last several contests, with Nikola Vucevic and Jeff Green providing starter-quality production in reserve roles. Sunday, the pair posted 16 and 14 points, respectively, and the bench accounted for 45 of the Magic's 98 points.

D.J. Augustin logged another start in place of Elfrid Payton and was second to Ibaka on the starting five with 12 points, three rebounds and three assists. Aaron Gordon was next, supplying 10 points and three rebounds. Evan Fournier underwhelmed, however, registering just five points on 1-of-7 shooting, along with two assists, a rebound and three steals. Vucevic added eight rebounds, two assists and two blocks to his bench-leading scoring total, while Green supplemented his aforementioned 14 points with five rebounds and three assists. 

Detroit (11-11) actually received a balanced effort from their starting five, which was led by Marcus Morris' 21 points. He added five rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. Reggie Jackson made his season debut and looked outstanding, collecting 18 points, four assists and a rebound over just 23 minutes while proving that his troublesome knee was in playing shape. Tobias Harris was able to provide 11 points, four rebounds and an assist against his former Magic teammates. Andre Drummond posted a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists, three steals and two blocks. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope cooled off from recent performances with a tally of nine points, nine rebounds, four assists and a steal. Ish Smith, who went back to the bench with Jackson's return, managed 11 points, two assists and a rebound while leading the second unit in scoring.

The Magic continue their swing through the Northeast with a trip to the nation's capital to face off with the Washington Wizards on Tuesday evening.

												The league's top two scorers squared off in epic proportions on Sunday as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans, 101-92.  

The Thunder (13-8) now sit at five games above .500 and are narrowly trailing the Rockets and Grizzlies for the fourth-best record in the Western Conference.  The bigger story from Sunday, however, was point guard Russell Westbrook's fifth straight triple-double.  Westbrook scored 28 points, had a whopping 17 rebounds, and dished out 12 assists.  Westbrook's streak of five games with a triple-double is the best of his career and the longest since Michael Jordan's seven-game streak in 1989.  The All-Star's effort helped to propel the Thunder to victory on Sunday, though solid perimeter defense advanced the team's cause.  The Pelicans were held to under 37 percent shooting from the field and 6-of-28 from three-point range.  The Thunder offense, meanwhile, shot almost 47 percent on the night, with solid contributions from guard Victor Oladipo (15 points) and bench big man Enes Kanter (17 points, 10 rebounds).  

For the Pelicans (7-14), meanwhile, 37 points for league-leading scorer Anthony Davis was not enough to earn the win.  In addition to the scoring output, Davis had 15 rebounds, two steals, and four blocks.  The Pelicans struggled aside from Davis, however, as the rest of the starting five combined for just 25 points.  The team also saw a rebounding deficit despite Davis's strong performance on the boards, as the Thunder held a 59-51 advantage on the glass.

The Thunder will visit the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, while the Pelicans will host the Memphis Grizzlies.

												The host New York Knicks defeated the Sacramento Kings, 106-98, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. 

While there weren't many swings in this game, it stayed close throughout. In fact, there were only five lead changes and one tie, as it took some clutch free-throws from the Knicks to close things out. New York actually held the lead for the final three quarters, as the Kings could never quite crawl back in. Defense was key for New York, as they held the Kings to 32 percent shooting from the field and from three-point range. They also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle, 58-50. 

Sacramento (7-13) just couldn't score in this ball game, but they did a good job of hanging around until the buzzer. DeMarcus Cousins did lead the team with 36 points and 12 rebounds, but went just 9-of-30 from the field in an inefficient game. Rudy Gay tallied 22 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals. Darren Collison was the only other Kings player in double figures, accumulating 13 points, three rebounds and six assists. On deck for Sacramento is a road game against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. 

New York (11-9) have been playing their best ball of the season recently and this win only adds to that success. Derrick Rose continues to improve in this offense, as he tallied 20 points, five rebounds and six assists on 9-of-14 shooting. Carmelo Anthony scored 20 points of his own, adding three rebounds and an assist. Kristaps Porzingis shot just 6-of-18 from the field, but totaled 15 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks in the win. Brandon Jennings was a nice spark off the bench too, dropping 19 points in 25 minutes. New York will look to keep rolling against the Miami Heat on Tuesday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center 111-102 on Sunday. 

The Pacers (10-10) spread the ball effectively and saw all five starters finish in double figures on their way to picking up wins in three of their last four contests. The Clippers (16-6) dropped their third game of the year at home, and have been sliding after a strong start to the season that once had them at the top of the Western Conference. 

The Pacers' four-point halftime lead started to expand on behalf of Indiana throughout the third quarter. C.J. Miles trip to the free throw line with 1:46 left in the the third quarter extended the lead to 10 points, Thaddeus Young continued the trend for the Pacers after his two point bucket built the lead to 18 points midway through the fourth quarter, and Indiana did not need to look back after that. 

Young led the Pacers with 17 points, to go along with seven rebounds and two assists, while Paul George suited up and played 34 minutes. George finished with 16 points, seven rebounds and five assists on 6-of-13 shooting. Myles Turner, Jeff Teague and Monta Ellis all finished in double figures scoring, while Rodney Stuckey led the bench with 16 points. 

Blake Giffin turned in a big performance, but it was not enough to cut in the building Pacers lead in the second half. The forward totaled 24 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, one steal and two blocks on 10-of-21 shooting. J.J. Redick added five threes in the loss, and finished with 15 points. 

Next up, the Clippers host the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Pacers play the second game of a back-to-back at the Warriors on Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112-103, at Bradley Center on Saturday.

The surging Bucks (10-8) utilized a balanced effort from their first unit to outlast a game Nets squad that received a game-high 24 points from Bojan Bogdanovic.

The big man added seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal over 27 minutes.

Sean Kilpatrick checked in second behind Bogdanovic with 19 points, three assists and a rebound, despite shooting just 3-of-13 from the field. Brook Lopez had a down game by his standards, posting 13 points, six assists, four rebounds, three blocks and a steal. Anthony Bennett got the start at power forward for Trevor Booker and supplied a modest seven points but did haul in 14 rebounds. Joe Harris led the second unit with 17 points, five rebounds, two assists and a steal. 

Matthew Dellavedova contributed a season-best 18 points, which he supplemented with six assists and two rebounds.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Charlotte Hornets in overtime, 125-120, at Spectrum Center on Saturday.

The Timberwolves (6-14) may have looked like somewhat easy prey to the hometown Hornets, considering they came in with a 5-14 record despite their solid talent. The first quarter did nothing to dissuade those beliefs, as Charlotte (11-9) jumped out to a 29-19 lead after the first 12 minutes. However, Minnesota clawed back to trail by only three, 52-49 by intermission. The second half was a continuous see-saw battle that appeared like it might go the Hornets' way in the closing seconds, until an Andrew Wiggins 31-foot three-point jumper with eight seconds remaining knotted the score at 106. He then sunk a pair of clutch free throws with 11 seconds remaining in overtime to give Minnesota some crucial breathing room at 123-118. That five-point margin was the final separation between the two teams, as the Timberwolves secured only their third road win of the season.

Wiggins totaled 29 points overall while leading the visitors, and he added four assists, a rebound and three steals. Karl-Anthony Towns was right behind him with 27 points, 15 rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. Zach LaVine supplied 17 points, three assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block. Ricky Rubio managed a modest seven points but did dish out 12 assists. Nemanja Bjelica and Shabazz Muhammad led the bench with a pair of 12-point efforts, and also totaled eight rebounds between them.

The Hornets were paced by Kemba Walker, who posted 22 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Frank Kaminsky III got another start at power forward in place of Marvin Williams and tallied 21 points, nine rebounds, five assists, a steal and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist registered 15 points, six rebounds and an assist. Nicolas Batum matched his point total and made it a double-double with 12 assists, while also hauling in eight rebounds, recording three steals and posting a block. Marco Belinelli led the second unit with 15 points.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 128-84, at Air Canada Centre on Saturday.

The Hawks (10-11) checked in to Saturday as a badly flawed team, sporting five consecutive losses on their ledger and once again missing star power forward Paul Millsap due to a hip injury. Their most recent defeat, a 121-85 trouncing at the hands of the Detroit Pistons on Atlanta's home court, had come just a night prior. Things looked like they had nowhere to go but up, but the floundering Hawks found a way to sink even further. They shot just 39.8 percent from the field and 25 percent from three-point range in a season-worst 44-point loss, while surrendering 57.6 and 54.2 percent success rates to the Raptors (14-6) in those respective categories. The visitors were also outrebounded by a 48-38 margin and committed 18 turnovers while only forcing 12.

Atlanta was led by a pair of 15-point efforts, the first of which came from Dennis Schroder, who supplemented the scoring with six assists, a rebound and a steal. Tim Hardaway, Jr. supplied the second off the bench, and added a rebound, assist, steal and block over 23 minutes. Dwight Howard was the only other member of the starting five with double digits in the scoring column, supplying a 10-point, 17-rebound double-double that also included an assist and two blocks. Mike Muscala, who started in Millsap's stead, Kyle Korver and Kent Bazemore combined for just 21 points. Kris Humphries was also productive in a reserve role, registering 10 points and three rebounds.

The Raptors saw eight players manage double-digit scoring and were led by DeMar DeRozan, who posted 21 points, four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Backcourt mate Kyle Lowry followed with 17 points, eight assists, eight rebounds and a block. Pascal Siakam totaled a career-high 14 points and complemented them with three rebounds, two blocks and a steal. DeMarre Carroll managed 10 points, five rebounds and three steals.  Patrick Patterson led the bench with 17 points, four rebounds, two assists and a steal, while Terrence Ross (15 points), Lucas Nogueira (11 points) and Cory Joseph (10 points) also showed up well on the stat sheet. 

The Hawks head back home to face off with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday evening, while the Raptors remain home to take on the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night as well.

												The Boston Celtics earned a 107-106 win as they survived a hard-fought game in Philadelphia as the 76ers took them down to the wire at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday evening. 

The 76ers started out strong with a 30-point first quarter and held on to lead by eight at halftime. The Celtics battled back early in the third to tie it up at 74 heading into the fourth. With 1:08 left in the game the Celtics led by four before a couple of hustle plays by Dario Saric tied it up at 100 with 30 seconds left. However, Isaiah Thomas answered with a flash to the basket for the go-ahead layup, which served to put Boston in control the rest of the way. 

The Celtics (11-8) earned their second win in as many nights as they hung-in on the second night of a back-to-back. Isaiah Thomas led the way, tying his season-high in points with 37 on 11-of-19 shooting, along with seven assists and four rebounds, in 33 minutes, while Avery Bradley was solid with 20 points and nine rebounds. The Celtics have won six of their last eight games and will look to continue the momentum as they visit Houston on Monday. 

The 76ers (4-16) put up a solid fight, led by rookie Dario Saric, who tied his career-high with 21 points, and grabbed 12 rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench. Meanwhile, all five starters scored in double figures Philly, including Ersan Ilyasova with 18 points and Sergio Rodriguez, who tallied a career-high 15 points, along with eight assists and two steals, in 32 minutes. The Sixers shot 15-of-33 from long range and 46 percent from the field over all, but gave up 17 turnovers in the loss. They will look to avoid their seventh straight loss as they play host to the Nuggets on Monday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies avoided a collapse in the final seconds as they hung-on to defeat the pesky Los Angeles Lakers 103-100 at FedEx Forum, on Saturday night.

After a 37-point second quarter, the Lakers took an eight-point lead into halftime, however the Grizzlies fought back to tie it up at 82 heading into the fourth. Memphis led 103-97 with 55 seconds left but the Lakers were not done as Lou Williams was fouled on a jumper and completed the three-point play to make it a one-possession game. The Grizzlies then turned the ball over with 15 seconds left and proceeded to foul Julius Randall on a three-point attempt. Fortunately for the Grizz, Randall missed all three free throws, and they were able to walk away with their seventh home win of the season. 

Lou Williams went-off for the Lakers (10-12) as he poured in 40 points on 11-of-20 shooting, including 4-of-8 from long range, in 32 minutes off the bench. However the Lakers struggled overall with 18 turnovers compared to only 16 assists, while shooting 43 percent from the field. They will look to get back on track as they play host to the Jazz on Monday. 

The Grizzlies (13-8) earned their second straight win and move to 2-1 without Mike Conley. Troy Daniels continued his strong play as he led Memphis with a season-high 31 points on 12-of-23 shooting, including 6-of-12 from long range.

												The Dallas Mavericks led wire-to-wire on their way to the 107-82 win over the visiting Chicago Bulls on Saturday night at American Airlines Arena. 

The Mavs took advantage of a Chicago team that left it all on the court Friday night in their win over Cleveland, while the Bulls lack of depth was exposed as they looked depleted on the second night of a back-to-back. 

Dallas (4-15) jumped out with a 29-18 first quarter and did not let up, winning the remaining three quarters. Wesley Matthews led the way for the Mavs as he tied his season-high with 26 points. Rookie Dwight Powell notched a career-high 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting, in 26 minutes off the bench, while Deron Williams dished a season-high 15 assists. The Mavs tallied 31 assists on 40 field goals and forced 20 turnovers on the way to their fourth win of the season and third at home. They will look to win two in a row for the second time this season as they host the Hornets on Monday, in what will be the second game of a four-game home stand. 

Chicago (11-8) was caught flat-footed, as Dwyane Wade did not play for the sake of rest, while starters Rajon Rondo and Nicola Mirotic combined for two points. Jimmy Butler was the high-point man for the Bulls with 26 points on 8-of-18 shooting, along with 10-of-12 from the free throw line. Meanwhile, the Bulls had seven players come off the bench with four of them playing over 20 minutes but they only totaled 28 bench points. Chicago will look to get back on track as they play host to the Trail Blazers on Monday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Denver Nuggets, 105-98, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday. 

Despite the final scoreline being close, the Jazz were in control for the majority of the game. The third quarter was when Utah made their mark, as they outscored the Nuggets, 33-16. Denver did all they could to fight back in the fourth though, as they scored 35 points and pulled the game within four points  before losing by seven. Free-throw shooting was the key for Utah, as they went 26-of-28 from the charity stripe. Three-point shooting kept the Nuggets hanging around, as they went 13-of-24 in the defeat and made 7-of-7 at one point in the fourth. 

Denver (7-13) have been struggling recently and they looked lost at times in this defeat. Wilson Chandler once again led the team in scoring, as he tallied 20 points, five rebounds and three assists off the bench. Will Barton matched that team-leading 20 points, as he added five rebounds and four assists. Jameer Nelson was a nice spark off the bench as well, accumulating 13 points, four rebounds and seven assists. On deck for the Nuggets is a matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.

Utah (12-9) had to play this game extremely shorthanded, but they were still able to prevail with a win. Gordon Hayward was the catalyst, as he scored a game-high 32 points. Rodney Hood was second on the team, as he scored 15 points on an inefficient 4-of-14 shooting. Rudy Gobert was a presence down low, as he totaled seven points, 11 rebounds and two blocks. Utah will face the Los Angeles Lakers on the road for their next game on Monday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Miami Heat, 99-92, at Moda Center on Saturday. 

The Trail Blazers came into this game as a heavy favorite, but it took a late run to pull out the close win. In fact, Portland finished the game on a 14-1 run over the final three minutes. There were six ties and nine lead changes, with no team leading by more than 12 points. Three-point shooting was the biggest difference in the game, with Miami shooting just 29 percent to Portand's 38 percent. The Trail Blazers won despite shooting just 40 percent from the field. 

Miami (7-13) came into this game winning two-straight and it would be three-straight if it weren't for poor late game execution. Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game though, accumulating 28 points, 16 rebounds and five blocks in the defeat. Goran Dragic flirted with a triple-double, accruing 18 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Josh McRoberts got a rare start, tallying 13 points two rebounds and four assists. Only three players came off the bench, as Miami played extremely shorthanded. The Heat will look to bounce back on Tuesday, as they host the New York Knicks for their next game. 

This was only the second time this season that the Blazers (11-10) didn't get at least 50 points from Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, but they were still able to prevail with a win. They still played well though, as Lillard tallied 19 points, four rebounds and six assists, while McCollum finished with 17 points, four rebounds and four assists. Neither player shot well, as they combined to go 13-of-37 from the field. Maurice Harkless was the quiet hero, as he totaled 17 points and seven rebounds in the win. Allen Crabbe was huge off the bench, scoring 16 points. The Trail Blazers will return to action on Monday in a road game against the Chicago Bulls.

												The host Golden State Warriors defeated the Phoenix Suns, 138-109, at Oracle Arena on Saturday. 

The Warriors came into this game as a monster favorite and they left very little doubt in who the better team was. Not only did they win all four quarters, they never relinquished the lead after the first quarter. Golden State were lights-out shooting, as they went 49-of-78 from the field and 14-of-21 from three-point range. Ball movement was key, as the Warriors assisted on 38 of their 49 made baskets. Many statistics were lopsided, as Golden State dominated the paint scoring, fastbreak points and points off turnovers. 

Phoenix (6-14) came in with a league-worst defense and they left feeling even more discouraged. Eric Bledsoe did continue his great run though, as he tallied 27 points, five rebounds, four assists and five steals in the defeat. Devin Booker was second on the team, scoring 21 points and dishing out five assists. No player on the team had more than five assists and no player reached double figures in rebounding. Brandon Knight led the bench in scoring, dropping 14 points in 22 minutes. Phoenix's next game is on Tuesday, when they play the Utah Jazz on the road. 

Golden State (17-3) were expected to win by 17 and they nearly doubled that spread with unstoppable offense. Stephen Curry led the team in scoring, dropping 31 points on 10-of-15 shooting. Klay Thompson had one of his best games of the season as well, accumulating 26 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals in the blowout win. Kevin Durant wasn't far behind, tallying 20 points, four rebounds and eight assists. The bench combined for 45 points, as they were used for the majority of the fourth quarter. Golden State will play again on Monday, as they host the Indiana Pacers for their next game.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 105-88, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday.

The Magic's Aaron Gordon has been having a rough go of it this season, even suffering a demotion from the starting lineup at one point. However, Friday may ultimately prove to be a turning point, as the third-year forward collected a season-high 20 points to key Orlando's (8-12) fourth road victory. Gordon complemented the offense with a pair of rebounds and a block, and the Magic enjoyed one of their better shooting nights of the campaign on the way to their best scoring haul yet, tallying success rates of 47.4 percent from the field and 50.0 percent from three-point range. 

Evan Fournier and Serge Ibaka followed with a pair of 16-point efforts for the Magic, with the former adding four boards, three assists and two steals, and the latter posting four rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. D.J. Augustin got another start at point guard and supplied nine points, four assists and three rebounds over 22 minutes, while Bismack Biyombo registered four points but brought down 13 rebounds. Jeff Green and Nicola Vucevic were excellent off the bench, with 16 and 12 points, respectively. Vucevic also tallied 11 rebounds, dished out five assists and had both a steal and a block. 

The Sixers (4-15) were once again led by Joel Embiid, who celebrated the raising of his minutes limit by putting together a 25-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists. No other member of the starting five hit double digits in the scoring column, but Gerald Henderson (nine points, three rebounds) and Robert Covington (nine points, six rebounds, an assist and two steals) were productive. Sergio Rodriguez and Ersan Ilyasova combined for another 15 points, Jahlil Okafor paced the second unit with a 16-point, 13-rebound double-double that also featured a pair of blocks. 

The Magic continue on their road trip with a trip to Detroit for a Sunday evening date with the Pistons, while the Sixers are home again on Saturday evening to face off with the Boston Celtics.

												The Boston Celtics hung on to defeat the visiting Sacramento Kings 97-92 on Friday night at TD Garden. 

After a tight first half the Kings took a 72-69 lead into the fourth quarter, however Boston used a 14-4 run to take a seven-point lead with six and a half minutes to go. The Celtics were able to hang on thanks to a couple of clutch plays by Al Horford, including a clutch three-pointer and game-saving defense on DeMarcus Cousins, who had the chance to tie the game as the Kings in-bounded the ball with nine seconds left, down by three. 

The Celtics (11-8) improved to 5-4 at home and continue moving in the right direction as they have won five of their last seven games. Horford was the high-point man for Boston on Friday, with 26 points to go along with eight rebounds and a monstrous six blocks. Isaiah Thomas added 20 points, while Jae Crowder chipped in 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting, including 3-of-5 from deep. 

The Kings (7-12) have now lost two straight and fall to 3-7 on the road this season as they could not break the spell that has them winless in Boston since 2007. They are 1-2 on their current road trip which has them in New York to face the Knicks on Sunday before winding-up the trip in Dallas on Wednesday.

												The host Toronto Raptors defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 113-80, at Air Canada Center on Friday.

The Raptors came into this game as a sizable favorite and they left no doubt with this result. In fact, Toronto pulled out the rare wire-to-wire win, as they dominated from start to finish. The second quarter is when it really fell apart for Los Angeles, as they allowed Toronto to drop 41 points, as they trailed by 21 headed into the half. The assist-to-turnover ratio was a huge difference, with Toronto recording 25 assists to 10 turnovers, while Los Angeles matched their turnovers and assists at 16 a piece. The Raptors shot 54 percent from the field, while the Lakers shot just 34 percent. 

Los Angeles (10-11) has been regressing over recent weeks and this was a tough task north of the border. The bench was the only thing keeping them around, as Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both scored in double figures yet again. They did struggle shooting though, as Williams went 4-of-14 on his way to 13 points and Clarkson went 4-of-15 for 14 points. Brandon Ingram was the lone starter in double figures, as he totaled 17 points and six rebounds in the defeat. Julius Randle finished with eight points and eight rebounds in just 22 minutes. The Lakers will have to play again on Saturday, as they face the Memphis Grizzlies on the road.

Toronto (13-6) has now won five-straight games and are scoring at will. In fact, they are averaging just shy of 120 points a game in that span. The Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan duo once again carried the load. Lowry tallied 24 points, four rebounds and seven assists, while DeRozan finished with 16 points, four rebounds and six assists. Norman Powell started for DeMarre Carroll and accrued 16 points and seven rebounds as a nice fill-in small forward. Cory Joseph and Lucas Nogueira combined for 27 points on 12-of-15 shooting off the bench. Toronto will remain at home, as they host the struggling Atlanta Hawks on Saturday.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 118-114, at Madison Square Garden on Friday.

Carmelo Anthony has begun to cede some of the offensive responsibility to sophomore sensation Kristaps Porzingis in some games due to the latter's emergence, and such was the case when these two teams met just two nights prior. However, the perennial All-Star took back the mantle Friday, leading the way with 29 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals. He also drained two key free throws with six seconds left, giving the Knicks (10-9) their final two points of the night and effectively sealing the win. His stellar performance led the way on a night when the entire New York starting five managed to hit double digits in the scoring column, and that also saw New York shoot 47.7 percent from the field overall. 

The Timberwolves (5-14) were paced by a 23-point output from Zach LaVine, who complemented the scoring with three assists, two rebounds and a steal. Karl Anthony-Towns totaled 20 points, eight boards, an assist and a trio of blocks. Andrew Wiggins contributed 19 points, four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Gorgui Dieng and Ricky Rubio were only able to total a combined five points, however, taking only six shots between them. However, the bench helped make up for some of the offensive void by scoring 47 points overall. The second unit was led by Nemanja Bjelica, who supplied 17 points, seven boards and three assists. Shabazz Muhammad managed 14 points, two rebounds and an assist, while Cole Aldrich contributed a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double, along with two assists, three blocks and two steals, over 27 minutes. 

Derrick Rose was second behind Anthony with 24 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal. Kyle O'Quinn was outstanding in another start at center for Joakim Noah, posting a 20-point, 13-rebound double-double that also featured two assists and two blocks. Justin Holiday got the start at two-guard and compiled 13 points, seven rebounds, three steals and a block, while Porzingis came back down to earth with 11 points, five rebounds, three assists and three blocks. 

The Timberwolves hit the road again Saturday, traveling to Charlotte to face off with the Hornets. The Knicks remain home to take on the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.

												The Chicago Bulls continue to impress as they earned perhaps their biggest win of the season, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 111-105 at United Center on Friday.

The Cavaliers have a problem on their hands as they dropped their third straight while following the same trend of winning the first and fourth quarters and being dominated in the middle two quarters. In their last two losses combined the Cavs were out-scored 123-79 over the second and third quarters and in this contest added to that deficit as they were out-scored 58-47 over the second and third quarters. Again, they won the first and fourth quarters on Friday, even cutting the gap to four with eight seconds to go, but fell short once again, leading to a season-high losing streak of three games and counting.

LeBron James led the way for the Cavs (13-5) with 27 points, 13 assists and five rebounds, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points, eight assists and six rebounds. The Cavs shot 54.2 percent from the field but only got to the foul line 10 times where they hit 5-of-10. The Cavs go on to visit Toronto on Monday, in what will be the second game of a three-game road trip.

Jimmy Butler was the high-point man for the Bulls (11-7) with 26 points, while Dwyane Wade was right behind with 24 points. All five starters scored in double figures for Chicago, including Rajon Rondo who finished with a triple-double consisting of 15 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. The Bulls move to 5-2 at home but face the second night of a back-to-back as they travel to Dallas to take on the Mavericks Saturday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans, 114-96, at Smoothie King Center on Friday.

The Clippers are the far superior team and they showed why in this win. In fact, they led for the entirety of the second half, leading by 20 points at times in their victory. Los Angeles was lights-out from the field, shooting 51 percent from the field, 42 percent from three-point range and 88 percent from the free-three line. Turnovers really killed the Pelicans, as they committed 14, while forcing just nine from the Clippers. The Los Angeles starters controlled the game, outscoring the New Orleans starters, 77-48.

The Clippers (16-5) were playing the second half of a back-to-back, but that didn't appear to slow them down a bit. Blake Griffin was the player of the game, as he accumulated 27 points, 10 rebounds and four assists in the win. Chris Paul flirted with a triple-double, amassing 17 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists. DeAndre Jordan scored just six points, but grabbed 13 rebounds and recorded two blocks. Jamal Crawford dropped 21 important points off the bench as well. On deck for Los Angeles is a home matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday. 

The Pelicans (7-13) have been much better recently, but this was a tough task against an elite Clippers team. Anthony Davis was the only starter in double figures, as he tallied 21 points, six rebounds and four assists. E'Twaun Moore was second on the team, scoring 15 points off the bench. Tim Frazier accrued eight points and eight assists as the starting point guard. Terrence Jones had a nice game off the bench, totaling 12 points and nine rebounds. The Pelicans will return to action on Sunday, when they face the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 121-85, at Phillips Arena on Friday. 

The Pistons (11-10) endured their share of offensive struggles in the early going of the season, including a recent stretch where they failed to hit the 100-point mark in four of six contests. However, they've certainly gotten the hot hand over the last three contests, posting 112 points three games ago and a pair of 121-point tallies in the two subsequent games. They were at it again Friday against a normally stingy Hawks defense, reaching the 121-point milestone for a third straight outing while being led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. The talented two-guard posted 23 points, which included a 5-of-8 mark from beyond the arc, along with eight rebounds and a steal. The four other members of the starting five also got into double digits in the scoring column, and the Pistons managed impressive success rates of 53.9 and 58.6 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively. 

Tobias Harris followed KCP's output with 18 points, seven boards, two assists and two blocks. Andre Drummond supplied a 14-point, 14-rebound double-double that also featured two assists, a steal and a block. Marcus Morris collected 12 points, four rebounds and two assists, while Ish Smith registered an 11-point, 13-assist double-double that included five rebounds and a steal. Jon Leuer continued his strong work off the bench with a near double-double of his own, totaling 16 points, nine rebounds, two assists and a steal. Beno Udrih and Darrun Hilliard also contributed a pair of 11-point efforts in a reserve role. 

Dennis Schroder was the only member of the starting five for the Hawks (10-10) to manage double-digit scoring, posting 17 points, 11 assists and a pair of rebounds. Kent Bazemore and Kyle Korver totaled only 14 points between them, Thabo Sefolosha was in the starting lineup again with Paul Millsap sitting out with a hip injury, but he was only able to supply five points, two rebounds and a steal. Dwight Howard was particularly ineffective, totaling only two points, six rebounds and two blocks over 25 minutes. The second unit saw some more run than usual due to the blowout loss, and three bench players got into double digits in the scoring column. Mike Muscala's and Tim Hardaway's pair of 11-point efforts led the way, while Kris Humphries followed closely behind with 10. 

The Pistons return home to face the Orlando Magic on Sunday, while the Hawks head north of the border to face the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs survived a wild one as they out-lasted the Washington Wizards, 107-105 on Friday to earn their fifth win at AT&T Center this season. 

The Spurs (16-4) move to 5-4 at home as they narrowly escaped with the win, fighting-off a go-ahead and then a tying bucket by the Wizards in the last minute. Bradley Beal hit a three with just under a minute remaining to take the 103-102 lead but Danny Green answered back with his only bucket of the game, a three-pointer to take a 105-103 lead with 19 seconds left. The Wizards countered again as John Wall flashed to the hoop for a lay up to tie it at 105 but the Spurs got the last laugh as Kawhi Leonard knocked down a clutch jumped from just inside the arc to seal the win.

Leonard led the way for the Spurs with 23 points, while LaMarcus Aldridge followed up with 19 points. The Spurs have won 11 of their last 12 games and look to continue rolling as they visit Milwaukee to take on the Bucks on Monday. 

All five starters scored in double figures for the Wizards (6-12) as they dropped their second in a row and continue to look for answers in their sub-prime start to the season. They warp-up a three game road trip as they visit Brooklyn to take on the Nets on Monday.

												The visiting Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets on Friday, 128-110.

Houston (13-7) seemingly had no problem on Friday despite playing a double-OT game in Oakland against the Warriors on Thursday night.  The grueling schedule did not stop the Rockets from taking both halves of their back-to-back.  Much of the team's success can be attributed to star guard James Harden, who followed a triple-double on Thursday with 20 points, six rebounds, and seven assists in Denver.  Harden and the Rockets have provided the most three-heavy offense in the league this season, and hit 17 three-pointers on Thursday to show it.  Houston's bench played a critical role in the win, with sixth man Eric Gordon scoring 18 points and sophomore Sam Dekker scoring 17.  

The Nuggets (7-12), meanwhile, have now won only one of their last five games.  Denver remains the top rebounding team in the league, and held a 52-42 advantage against Houston on the boards.  Unfortunately for the Nuggets, this has not translated to the win column.  The team struggled to match its opponent on the perimeter on Thursday, hitting just nine three-pointers on 30 percent shooting while allowing its opponents to shoot 50 percent from the field and hit 17 threes.  Forward Wilson Chandler was an exception, as he continued his strong scoring stretch with 24 points from the bench.  

The Nuggets will visit Utah on Saturday, while the Rockets will host the Celtics on Monday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 97-87, at Spectrum Center on Thursday.

The offensively-challenged Mavericks (3-15) checked in to Thursday's contest having failed to score in the triple digits in 10 of their last 11 games, and with Dirk Nowitzki out again with an Achilles injury, they struggled yet again. They managed respective 37.2 percent and 29.0 percent tallies from the field and three-point range, despite seeing five players post double-digit scoring performances. The Hornets (11-8) were better overall from the field (47.3 percent), even though Kemba Walker paced the offense with a relatively modest 18 points. 

Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 17 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, an assist and two steals. Deron Williams and Wesley Matthews followed with a pair of 14-point efforts, with the former adding eight assists and three rebounds and the latter also bringing in three rebounds and dishing out two assists. Matthews did struggle considerably from long range, however, going just 1-of-11 from beyond the arc. Justin Anderson paced the second unit with 15 points and three rebounds, while Jonathan Gibson contributed 11 points, five assists, two rebounds and two steals in 27 minutes as a reserve as well. 

Michael Kidd-Gilchrist followed closely behind Walker with 14 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block. Nicolas Batum filled out the stat sheet nicely with a near double-double consisting of 12 points, nine rebounds, six assists and a steal. Cody Zeller and Frank Kaminsky combined for just seven points but 10 rebounds as well. Jeremy Lamb led the second unit with 12 points, six rebounds, two assists and a block, while Roy Hibbert tallied 11 points, four rebounds, two assists and a pair of blocks in 17 minutes off the bench. 

The Mavericks head back home to take on the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night, while Hornets continue their home stand with a Saturday night showdown against the Timberwolves.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 111-93, at Barclay's Center on Thursday.

These are two teams going in opposite directions and this result shows which way they're heading. The second half is when Milwaukee really turned it on, as they outscored Brooklyn, 59-42 in that 24-minute span. Prior to that, there were 12 lead changes and six ties, as it was close throughout the first half. Defense was key for the Bucks, as they held the Nets to 38 percent from the field and 30 percent from three-point range. Milwaukee also dominated the paint, winning the rebounding battle 48-40 and recording 10 blocks in their win. 

Milwaukee (9-8) has now won four of their last five and much of that success has to be attributed to the play of Giannis Antetokounmpo. The man known as the ""Greek Freak"" flirted with a triple-double in this win, accumulating 23 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and four steals in just 29 minutes of action. In fact, he sat out the entirety of the fourth quarter, as the game continued to get out of hand. Jabari Parker was second on the team with his 22 points on 8-of-14 shooting. John Henson started at center, totaling 12 points, eight rebounds and five blocks. Malcolm Brogdon had a nice game off the bench, tallying 13 points, four rebounds and four assists. 

Brooklyn (5-13) has really struggled on defense this season and this blowout loss only adds to those troubles. Sean Kilpatrick continued his good play though, accruing 14 points, six rebounds and four assists as the starting point guard. Brook Lopez finished with just 15 points and four rebounds on 4-of-12 shooting. Trevor Booker amassed nine points, eight rebounds and two steals in the defeat. Joe Harris led the bench in scoring, dropping 11 points, four rebounds and three assists. 

These two teams will face each other again on Saturday, as they travel to Milwaukee for that fixture.

												The Memphis Grizzlies came back to defeat the Orlando Magic, 95-94, at FedEx Forum on Thursday. 

Defense is the first priority for both of these teams and it's clear through this scoreline. Memphis shot just 42 percent from the field and 39 percent from three-point range, while Orlando shot 45 percent from the field and 25 percent from three-point range. The Magic led 84-71 with a little over three minutes left, but the Grizzlies ended the game on a 24-10 run to win by one. Strangely. the two teams combined for 114 points in the first and fourth quarters, while combining for just 75 points in the second and third quarters. Turnovers are what really hurt the Magic, as they committed 18, while forcing just 10 from the Grizzlies.

Orlando (7-12) has made some adjustments to their rotation and the results have been mixed thus far. Nikola Vucevic continues to thrive in his new role off the bench though, as he tallied 18 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in the defeat. Evan Fouriner led the team in scoring, dropping 28 points on 11-of-14 shooting. Serge Ibaka was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 11 points, eight rebounds and four blocks. Bismack Biyombo scored just three points, but grabbed 14 rebounds as the starting center. Jeff Green provided 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting off the bench. Orlando plays again on Friday, as they face the Philadelphia 76ers on the road. 

Memphis (12-8) continues to play shorthanded and they won't allow that to slow them down. Marc Gasol proceeds to carry the load in the absence of Mike Conley and Chandler Parsons, as he led the team with 25 points, two rebounds, three assists and five blocks in the win. Andrew Harrison finished with 11 points, four rebounds and eight assists while filling-in for Conley. Troy Daniels was second on the team in scoring, dropping 19 points on 6-of-9 shooting off the bench. Jarell Martin also had a nice game off the bench, accruing six points and 10 rebounds. Memphis will return to action on Saturday, when they host the surprising Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-94 Thursday at Quicken Loans Arena.

The Clippers (15-5), who were coming off their worst loss of the season in overtime against the Brooklyn Nets, bounced back in superb fashion with a blowout victory over the Cavaliers (13-4), who have now lost two in a row. Los Angeles got out to a slow start, but were able to pull away from Cleveland with the help of big second and third quarters where they outscore the home team by 24 points. J.J. Redick led the way with a superb shooting night, scoring a team-high 23 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and 4-of-6 from behind the arc. As a team, the game was won for the Clippers with their outside shooting, as they shot 42 percent from long range overall. Blake Griffin struggled from the field after resting against the Nets, shooting just 4-of-14, but he still managed to record a double-double of 13 points and 11 assists. 

For the Cavaliers, this is the second dud they've put up in as many games, shooting just 40 percent from the field and recording 18 total turnovers to just 12 assists. Kyrie Irving had a solid evening, scoring a game-high 28 points on 8-of-19 shooting from the field, but both LeBron James and Kevin Love failed to produce much offensively, combining for 32 total points on 12-of-25 shooting. The only other Cleveland player to score in double figures was Richard Jefferson, who scored 12 points in 22 minutes off the bench. 

Up next, the Clippers will head to New Orleans on Friday to take on the Pelicans, while the Cavaliers travel to Chicago on Friday to play the Bulls.

												The Miami Heat defeated the host Utah Jazz on Thursday, 111-110.

It was a much-needed and narrow win for Miami (7-12), as the team had been sitting at 13th in the Eastern Conference.  Thursday's win came in dramatic fashion, with the game remaining a matter of single digits until the very end.  It was an off night for center Hassan Whiteside, who shot just 4-of-11 for nine points, but it was a strong showing for recently-returned point guard Goran Dragic.  Dragic led the team with 27 points and had six assists on the night.  The Heat have seen strong bench play recently, as was the case on Thursday.  Bench forward James Johnson delivered 24 points on 11-of-15 shooting, while bench guard Wayne Ellington had 17 points on 6-of-9.

The Jazz (11-9), meanwhile, had won four straight contests heading into Thursday, but have been decimated by injuries.  Star forward Derrick Favors remains out indefinitely with a knee injury, while starters George Hill and Rodney Hood were both forced to sit out Thursday's contest with minor injuries of their own.  Star Gordon Hayward, who had just recently returned from another injury, led the team with 32 points.  Veteran Joe Johnson added another 18.  It was an impressive offensive night for Utah despite missing key components.  The Jazz shot 54 percent from the field and hit 17 three-pointers on 56 percent from beyond the arc.  Ultimately, the Jazz lost narrowly in part due to recording only 31 rebounds and forcing just six Miami turnovers.

The Jazz will host the Denver Nuggets on Saturday, while the Heat will visit Portland.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Golden State Warriors 132-127 in double overtime at Oracle Arena on Thursday. 

The thrilling matchup that took two overtimes was a neck-and-neck affair from end-to-end. The second overtime was sloppy, given the minutes that both teams players were starting to accumulate at that point, however, it was James Harden and his monstrous triple-double that eventually separated the two teams. The fourth quarter came to a close with Kevin Durant on the free throw line, where the former MVP drained both shots to tie the game at 113 points a piece. Klay Thompson extended the first overtime to a second one after burying a 15-foot jumper on the Andre Iguodala assist with :27 left, but Durant failed to hit the game winner at the end of the first overtime with no time left on the clock. The Warriors (16-3) managed only four points in the second overtime, while the Rockets (12-7) were able to pull away with the combination of Harden and Trevor Ariza at the free throw line. 

Harden went on to finish with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists on 8-of-23 shooting, including 11-of-14 from the charity stripe. Ryan Anderson matched Harden in scoring with 29 points, while Eric Gordon pitched in another 20-plus point bench performance on his way to 23 points in total. 

Golden State utilized every player on their bench, which ran eight players deep. Only Iguodala finished in double figures with 10 points, to go along with four rebounds and five assists which also included stellar defensive play. Durant led the way with 39 points, in addition to 13 rebounds, two assists, three blocks and three steals. Stephen Curry managed 28 points on 22 shots, including four three-pointers, while Draymond Green fell one dime short of triple-double after scoring 20 points, grabbing 15 boards and dishing out nine assists.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Boston Celtics, 121-114, at TD Center on Wednesday.

The Pistons (10-10) checked in to Wednesday's contest having experienced their share of shooting struggles this season, although they'd shown signs of improvement in having won three of the prior four games. They heated up significantly from the field against the Celtics (10-8), managing a 55.2 percent success rate from the floor and 45.0 percent mark from three-point range. Four members of the first unit scored at least 20 points, led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who tallied a team-high 25, a total he supplemented with five rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block. 

Tobias Harris was next in line for the visitors, posting 21 points, six rebounds and four assists, his third straight 20-plus-point performance. Andre Drummond and Marcus Morris turned in respective 20-point efforts, with the former bouncing back for a Tuesday ejection for an errant elbow by also hauling in 17 rebounds, dishing out two assists, recording a pair of steals and posting a block, and the latter adding four rebounds, three assists, three blocks and a steal. Ish Smith fell just short of the 20-point milestone but filled out the stat sheet in fine fashion, registering 19 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and a block. Jon Leuer turned in a typically solid stat line off the bench, with 12 points, seven boards and two assists. 

The Celtics saw Isaiah Thomas pace them with 27 points, which he complemented with four assists but no other statistics. Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley were next with a pair of 14-point contributions. Crowder also had five rebounds, four assists and two steals and Bradley posted six boards and a steal. Amir Johnson had one of his more productive games with 11 points, five rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block, but Al Horford underwhelmed with nine points, five rebounds, four assists and a pair of stuffs. Kelly Olynyk was stellar off the bench with a 19-point contribution that led the second unit, while Marcus Smart also compiled 12 points in a reserve role.

The Pistons continue on the road and head south to Atlanta, where they'll face off with the Hawks on Friday night, while the Celtics remain home and await the Sacramento Kings for a showdown on Friday evening as well.

												The host Toronto Raptors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 120-105, at Air Canada Center on Wednesday. 

Despite the final scoreline, this game was tight throughout. In fact, neither team had more than a nine-point lead until the final six minutes, as there were nine ties and 15 lead changes in total. The second half is where the Raptors really turned it on, outscoring Memphis, 65-48 over the final 24 minutes. Toronto was lights-out from the field, shooting 55 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range. Rebounding was huge as well, with the Raptors grabbing 42 boards to the Grizzlies 30.

Memphis (11-8) had to play this game without Mike Conley and Zach Randolph and that was simply too much to overcome. Andrew Harrison was great filling-in for Conley though, tallying 21 points, four assists and three steals in the defeat. JaMychal Green finished the game with 16 points, five rebounds and five steals. Much of the offense was run through Marc Gasol, as he totaled 18 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Troy Daniels was a nice spark off the bench, dropping 19 points on 6-of-12 shooting. Memphis will finish their back-to-back set on Thursday, when they host the Orlando Magic. 

Toronto (12-6) allowed a beat-up Memphis team to hang around longer than they'd hope, but they got the result they needed. Kyle Lowry was the player of the game, accumulating 29 points, three rebounds, eight assists and two steals in the victory. DeMar DeRozan took just nine shots, but still finished with 24 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Those two combined to go 19-of-21 from the free-throw line and 14-of-22 from the field. Cory Joseph and Patrick Patterson were huge off the bench. Joseph accrued 16 points and eight rebounds, while Patterson amassed 14 points and 13 boards. On deck for the Raptors is a home matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the host Chicago Bulls, 96-90, at United Center on Wednesday.

In a battle between two offensively-minded teams, neither of these squads could find their shots. Chicago shot just 35 percent from the field, while Los Angeles shot 41 percent on their end. Three-point shooting wasn't pretty either, with the Lakers going 2-of-8 and the Bulls hitting 4-of-21. Bench scoring and rebounding were key for the Lakers, as they outrebounded the Bulls, 60-46 and outscored them on the bench, 56-16.  The assist-to-turnover ratio was the only big advantage for the Bulls, as they committed 14 turnovers to 22 assists, while the Lakers committed 23 turnovers to 17 assists.  There were seven ties and 14 lead changes, as this game was tight throughout. 

The Lakers (10-10) were a big underdog in this game, but this was an impressive performance on the road. The bench carried them once again, as Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams led the team in scoring. Clarkson finished with 18 points, four rebounds and three assists, while Williams finished with 18 points, five rebounds and five assists. Larry Nance Jr. was also very good off the bench, amassing 12 points, 11 rebounds and three steals. Julius Randle was the best starter, as he scored 13 points and tied a career-high with 20 rebounds. The Lakers will be on the road for their next game, as they face the Toronto Raptors on Friday. 

The Bulls (10-7) have been off for five days because of their circus road trip and they clearly had some rust to wear off in this tough loss. Despite every starter shooting 50 percent or below, they all finished with double figures in scoring. Robin Lopez was their best player, as he flirted with a triple-double in a 10-point, nine-rebound and eight-block game. Rajon Rondo was flirtatious himself, finishing with 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Jimmy Butler led the team in scoring, accruing 22 points, four rebounds, two assists and three steals on just 4-of-18 shooting. Despite being listed as questionable, Dwyane Wade still accumulated 17 points, four rebounds and six assists. Chicago's next game is a tough one, as they host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Washington Wizards 126-115 Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena. 

For the Thunder (12-8), they continue to roll as they have now won four in a row after dropping three straight. Wednesday night, Russell Westbrook served as the hero, as not only did he drop yet another triple-double with 35 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists, but he also hit a step-back 3-pointer in the closing moments to send the game into overtime -- the only three he hit in the game. From there, he would not be denied a victory, as he went on to score 14 of the team's 21 points in the overtime period, outscoring the Wizards, 14-10, on his own. Westbrook's night wasn't the most efficient, however, as he shot just 12-of-35 from the field and 1-of-6 from behind the arc. Victor Oladipo, on the other hand, had a very efficient evening, shooting 10-of-16 from the field en route to 25 points on top of six rebounds and six assists. 

The Wizards (6-11) are now losers of two of their last three games as they continue to battle inconsistent play early in this season. Bradley Beal, however, has remained consistently deadly since returning from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games. His 31 points on Wednesday night was his second straight 30-point effort in a row and he is now averaging 29 points over his last three games. His partner in the backcourt John Wall struggled shooting from the field, going just 6-of-20 overall and 2-of-7 from behind the arc, but he did record 15 points and 15 assists -- his second double-double in a row and fourth in the last five games. Washington will look back on this game, however, and see many missed opportunities at the free throw line, where they made just 16 of their 25 attempts. 

Up next, the Thunder will look to extend their winning streak on Sunday against the Pelicans, while the Wizards will head to San Antonio on Friday to take on the Spurs.

												The visiting New York Knicks narrowly beat the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, 106-104.

The Knicks (9-9) held a double-digit lead early in the fourth quarter but almost saw an incredible comeback from the Wolves.  Minnesota was able to tie the game with under a minute remaining, but could not close out the contest at the very end.  For New York, sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis led the way with an impressive 29 points.  The 21-year-old Latvian forward also added eight rebounds, four assists, and two blocks.  The Knicks were able to see big offensive output as a team thanks to their three-point shooting, as the team hit 13 threes while holding Minnesota to just four.  

Minnesota (5-13) saw a career night from reigning Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns despite the loss.  Towns led the team with 47 points on 15-of-22 shooting and 17-of-20 from the free-throw line.  The center added 18 rebounds in three blocks in what was truly a spectacular night for the young star.  The night was less spectacular for the rest of the Timberwolves' roster, as the team shot just 44 percent and took the loss despite Towns' ridiculous performance.  Wolves not named Towns shot 1-of-15 from three-point range, and the team struggled to find consistent offense all night.

The two teams will rematch in New York on Friday night.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Dallas Mavericks 94-97 Wednesday at American Airlines Center.

The Spurs (14-4) were playing their second leg of a back-to-back, but we able to bounce back nicely against Dallas (3-13) after dropping Tuesday's matchup against the Magic. San Antonio rested Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Pau Gasol on the second leg, but still managed to put together a solid offensive performance, shooting 46.5 percent from the field and an astounding 58 percent from behind the arc. It was backup point guard Patty Mills who shined off the bench Wednesday, as he shot 9-of-12 shooting from the field overall and 5-of-6 from behind the arc en route to a team-high 23 points. And it was a necessary effort, as the team's stars in Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge struggled mightily. Leonard managed 21 points, but shot just 5-of-16 from the field, while Aldridge could not get anything going, scoring just five points on 2-of-9 shooting. Danny Green was the only other Spur to score in double figures, notching 11 points. 

For the Mavericks, they continue to slide, with Wednesday's loss being their ninth in their last 10 games. It was yet another offensive struggle for Dallas too, with Wednesday's 87 points being the seventh time this season where they failed to score 90 points. Wesley Mathews led the way, scoring a game-high 26 points in 37 minutes. Harrison Barnes was the only other starter to reach double figures with 17 points, while Seth Curry and Dwight Powell scoring double figures off the bench, scoring 14 and 10 points respectively. As a team, the Mavericks shot a lowly 43 percent from the field. 

Up next, the Spurs will head home Friday to take on the Wizards, while the Mavericks will look to turn their season around in Charlotte on Thursday against the Hornets.

												The visiting Miami Heat defeated the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday, 106-98.

It was a back and forth game, with Miami (6-12) earning the win on strong fourth-quarter play.  The Heat outscored Denver 31-18 in the fourth, ending the game comfortably in the lead.  The Heat's Hassan Whiteside led the team in both scoring and rebounding, posting 25 and 16 respectively.  Whiteside also blocked four shots.  The big man's effort kept Miami competitive with the Nuggets on the glass, despite Denver's status as the top rebounding team in the league.  Miami saw a huge advantage in turnovers, coughing up the ball only six times while forcing 19 turnovers for Denver.  Strong defensive play contributed to the differential, as Miami stole the ball 14 times in total.

Denver (7-11) was held to just 41 percent shooting on the night, crumbling under the pressure of the tough Miami defense.  Starter Emmanuel Mudiay shot just 3-of-11 from the field, while forward Danilo Gallinari went just 6-of-16.  Gallinari was one of four Nuggets to tie for the team lead in scoring with 17 points.  Another one of those four, sophomore Nikola Jokic, had 17 points and 14 rebounds off the bench.  Jokic helped counter the poor shooting of his teammates by going 7-of-11 from the floor. 

The Heat will visit Utah on Thursday while the Nuggets will host the Rockets on Friday.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Atlanta Hawks 109-107 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Wednesday. 

The Suns (6-13) staved off a hungry Hawks (10-9) squad that was being led by Dennis Schroder down the stretch. The Atlanta point guard had one of his best games of the season after scoring 31 points to lead all scorers in the contest, and drew a needed foul from behind the three point line with just one second left remaining in the fourth quarter. Eric Bledsoe drained the free throws on the other end of the court to extend the lead to five points, which rendered Kent Bazemore's buzzer beating three pointer useless, as the Suns came away with the home win. 

Phoenix followed up a 36 point first quarter with a lowly 14 points in the second, which kept the Hawks within striking distance after they had multiple opportunities to put the game away early. Brandon Knight was the most effective player on the floor for the Suns, evidenced by his 23 points in 31 minutes off the bench, to go along with five rebounds, two assists and two steals. P.J. Tucker led the starters with 17 points, while Devin Booker finished with 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting. 

Schroder added four rebounds, nine assists and one block to his 13-of-23 shooting performance, while Bazemore scored 22 points to round out the starters for Atlanta. Tim Hardaway Jr. was the effective bench performer in 26 minutes of play, as he scored 21 points on 9-of-17 shooting. 

Next up, the Hawks host the Detroit Pistons on Friday, while the Suns visit the Golden State Warriors on Saturday.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Indiana Pacers 131-109 at Moda Center on Wednesday. 

The Blazers (10-10) had little trouble handling the Pacers (9-10) after three straight quarters above 30 points, including an explosive second quarter where Portland ran away with the game. The Blazers took 73-58 halftime lead and expanded on it in the third quarter. The final period had one moment where the Pacers looked to climb back into the game after Al Jefferson dropped in a short turn around hook shot to cut the lead to 13 points. Damian Lillard responds with a driving layup and the Blazers did not have to look back. 

Six Blazers players finished in double figures scoring, as Maurice Harkless, Mason Plumlee, Lillard and C.J. McCollum cracked double digits. Harkless and Lillard led the way 23 points and 28 points, respecitvally, but it was McCollum's hot hand in the second half that staved off the Pacers comeback attempts. Evan Turner and Allen Crabbe rounded out the rest of the double digit scorers, with both players combining for 28 points on 9-of-15 shooting. 

The Pacers were led by Jeff Teague, while Paul George (ankle) was sidelined. Teague finished with 25 points, eight assists, five rebounds and one block in 34 minutes. Myles Turner completed a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Glenn Robinson III continued to play effective minutes amongst the starters with 15 points and four rebounds on 6-of-10 shooting. 

Next up, the Hawks host the Detroit Pistons on Friday, while the Pacers visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 112-89, at Spectrum Arena on Tuesday.

The Pistons (9-10) checked in to Tuesday's contest with an unsightly 1-8 road record, a sharp contrast to the 7-2 mark they've compiled at the Palace at Auburn Hills. However, Tobias Harris took matters into his own hands, ensuring that Detroit would stop the bleeding away from home, at least for a night. He tallied a team-high 24 points and supplemented it with seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. He was aided by a pair of 18-point efforts from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Marcus Morris, which helped make up for a forgettable outing from Andre Drummond, who played just 13 minutes and scored three points on 1-of-6 shooting. Overall, the Pistons enjoyed one of their better shooting nights of the season, posting a 48.9 percent success rate from the field, while also limiting the Hornets (10-8) to sub-40 percent tallies from both the field and three-point range.

Caldwell-Pope added seven rebounds, seven assists, a steal and a block to his scoring total. Morris checked in with four rebounds and a steal in addition to his points. Ish Smith supplied 13 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal, while Jon Leuer led the reserves with 12 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

The Hornets found scoring to be at a premium throughout the night, with only three players across the entire roster managing double-digit points. Kemba Walker unsurprisingly led the way with 23 points, four assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was next with 10 points, four rebounds, a steal and a block. Cody Zeller registered a modest eight points but did haul in 10 rebounds. Nicolas Batum and Frank Kaminsky could only combine for 10 points, although Batum also brought in 11 boards and dished out five assists. Marco Belinelli paced the second unit with 11 points, two rebounds, two assists and a block.

The Pistons continue on the road, as they face the Boston Celtics on Wednesday. The Hornets are off until Thursday, when they welcome the Dallas Mavericks to town.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 127-122, in double-overtime at Barclays Center on Tuesday. 

The Clippers came into this game as a monster favorite, but things didn't go as planned. Los Angeles led for the first 45 minutes, but allowed Brooklyn to take their first lead with three minutes left. In fact, the Clippers had an 18-point lead late in the third quarter, as their backups allowed the Nets to crawl back in and send the game to two overtimes, thanks to a 34-21 fourth quarter. Brooklyn missed four free-throws in the final 30 seconds of the first overtime to allow the Clippers to send it to a second OT with a game-tying three. From there, the Nets took over in the second OT and escaped with a needed win. The biggest advantage for Brooklyn was in the paint, as they won that battle 52-42.

Los Angeles (14-5) had to play this game without Blake Griffin and that was simply too much to overcome. DeAndre Jordan stepped up in Griffin's absence though, totaling 21 points and 23 rebounds in the loss. Chris Paul recorded a triple-double, tallying 26 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists. J.J. Redick scored 18 points on an inefficient 7-of-18 shooting. Austin Rivers led the bench in scoring, dropping 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting.  The Clippers have a tough task for their next game as well, as they travel to play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday.

Brooklyn (5-12) came into this game in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, but snapped that with a huge upset here. Ironically, that losing streak started at the hands of the Clippers. Sean Kilpatrick went just 14-of-34 from the field, but finished with career-high 38 points and 14 rebounds in the win. Brook Lopez had one of his best games of the season as well, as he accumulated 27 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Trevor Booker accrued 15 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and four steals as the starting power forward. Bojan Bogdanovic finished with 14 points and six rebounds of his own. On deck for Brooklyn is a home matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 118-101 Tuesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center.

The Bucks (8-8) took advantage of a Cavaliers (13-3) team that looked disinterested from the second quarter on, as Milwaukee managed to open up a four-point lead at halftime and won the game with the help of a dominant third quarter, which they won 34-20. It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game-high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 53.5 percent from the floor.

For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3-point shots.  As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double-double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. 

Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.

												The host New Orleans Pelicans handily defeated the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 105-88.

New Orleans (7-12) has been able to turn its season around after a horrendous 1-9 start.  The return of point guard Jrue Holiday has been an integral part of the Pelicans' recent success.  Holiday scored 22 points and hit four of New Orleans' eight three-pointers on Tuesday.  Of course, the biggest factor for the Pelicans was All-Star forward Anthony Davis, who scored 41 points and grabbed 16 rebounds.  Davis is currently the league's leading scorer and an emerging candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, a case Davis furthered with four steals and two blocks on Tuesday.  The outing was Davis's 11th game of 25 points and 10 rebounds on the season.  Thanks in large part to Davis's dominance, it was an easy win for New Orleans, which hopped out to a 24-point lead by halftime.

Los Angeles (9-10), meanwhile, has been surprisingly hot to start the season but saw an unfortunate night on Tuesday.  Veteran Nick Young was forced to exit the game and was diagnosed with an Achilles strain after just two minutes of play.  Guard D'Angelo Russell continues to sit with an injury to his left knee.  The Lakers consequently saw big minutes from their bench on Tuesday, with five bench players tallying over 20 minutes.  Sixth man Lou Williams led the team with 16 points, while starter Julius Randle scored 12 and had 10 rebounds in just 22 minutes.

The Lakers will visit the Bulls on Wednesday, while New Orleans will host the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.

												The visiting Orlando Magic defeated the host San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday, 95-83.

Orlando (7-11) came into the game the heavy underdogs, with a bottom-three offense in the league and a record five games below .500.  Despite this, Orlando was able to put together an impressive defensive effort to slow the rolling Spurs.  The Magic kept the Spurs to just 37 percent shooting and only five three-pointers.  Orlando came away with 12 steals, finding ways to turn defense into offense consistently throughout the game.  Forward Serge Ibaka led the team in scoring with 18 points, while guard Evan Fournier had 13.

San Antonio (14-4), meanwhile, had won nine straight games heading into Tuesday's matchup.  Interestingly, the loss drops the Spurs to 4-4 at home on the season.  This figure comes on the heels of a 2015-16 season in which the Spurs became just the second team ever to win 40 regular season games at home.  While forwards Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge combined for 37 points, the rest of the roster struggled mightily on offense.  The team shot under 37 percent, turned the ball over 18 times, and had just 19 assists, in what proved to be one of the more dismal offensive outings for the Spurs all season.  

The Spurs will visit Dallas on Wednesday, while the Magic will see Memphis on Thursday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Houston Rockets 120-101 at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Tuesday.

The Jazz (11-8) found two big performances from two of their best players in Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert, but also suffered a blow when Rodney Hood injured his right hamstring after logging 19 points in 20 minutes of action. The high scoring affair got off to a quick start, but Hood's mid range jumper with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter started a 14-7 jazz run to end the period with a nine point lead. The Rockets trailed by double figures for almost all of the remaining three quarters, save for a brief stint at the start of the second half. 

Hayward led the way with 31 points, seven assists and five rebounds, to go along with a trio of three pointers and an impressive 12-of-13 free throw shooting. Gobert added his 11th double-double of the season behind 16 points and 14 rebounds, in addition to three blocks on 5-of-7 shooting across 33 minutes. 

The Rockets (11-7) were led by James Harden and his 26 points, seven assists and five rebounds on 8-of-23 shooting, while Eric Gordon pitched in 24 points on 17 shots in 32 minutes off the bench. Houston was unable to match the shooting efficiency on display by the Jazz, as the Rockets shot just 40.7 percent from the field and 36.7 percent from behind the arc. 

Both teams play on Thursday, as the Rockets visit the Golden State Warriors, while the Jazz host the Miami Heat.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Sacramento Kings, 101-95, in overtime at Verizon Center on Monday.

The Wizards (6-10) checked in the matchup against the Kings with an unsightly 5-10 record, but four of those victories had come at home. Sacramento (7-11) gave them a run for their money Monday, however, as DeMarcus Cousins exploded for a massive 36-point, 20-rebound double-double that also included four assists, two steals and a block. His driving layup with 10 seconds remaining in regulation knotted the score up at 92, and John Wall couldn't get what would have been a game-winning 19-foot jumper to go in with two seconds on the clock. Washington then dominated the extra period by a 9-3 margin, and Cousins missed a 26-foot three-point jumper with eight seconds left in overtime that essentially represented the Kings' last opportunity to get within striking distance.

Rudy Gay was next behind Cousins with 18 points, five rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. He also turned the ball over a team-high six times. The rest of the starting five was woefully unproductive, with Darren Collison, Arron Afflalo and Kosta Koufos combining for just 13 points. Ty Lawson paced the bench with the only other double-digit scoring performance on the team, posting 12 points, three assists and three steals. 

Bradley Beal contributed 31 points, six rebounds, three assists and a block to lead Washington on a 12-of-24 tally from the field and 4-of-7 from three-point range. Backcourt mate John Wall supplied a 19-point, 11-assist double-double, while also contributing eight rebounds, three steals and a block. However, he committed a game-high 11 turnovers as well. Otto Porter, Jr. registered 15 points, eight rebounds and three steals. Marcin Gortat collected 10 points, seven boards, three blocks and a steal. Kelly Oubre, Jr. posted a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two steals. 

The Kings continue their trek through the Northeast with a trip to the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night, while the Wizards visit the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday evening as well.

												The host Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 122-95, at Air Canada Center on Monday. 

The Raptors came into this game as a monster favorite and they didn't leave any doubt with this result. Toronto just continuously piled it on, as they won each quarter by at least four points. The Raptors were lights-out shooting, as they went 55 percent from the field and 68 percent from three-point range. They also held the Sixers to just 42 percent from the field and dominated the defensive rebounding, 34-26. Fastbreak points was a huge difference as well, with Toronto winning that battle, 21-6.

Philadelphia (4-14) had to play this game without Joel Embiid (rest) and they clearly didn't have enough to compete with a potent Raptors squad. Robert Covington had one of his best games of the season though, tallying 20 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals on 7-of-11 shooting. Jahlil Okafor got the start for Embiid and finished with 15 points and five rebounds.  Sergio Rodriguez, Ersan Ilyasova, Nik Stauskas and Richaun Holmes all finished with 11 points a piece. The Sixers will return to action on Wednesday, when they host the Sacramento Kings for their next game. 

Toronto (11-6) left very little doubt in this game who the more superior team is. Kyle Lowry carried the load for the Raptors, accumulating 24 points, four rebounds and eight assists. Terrence Ross was great off the bench, scoring 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting. DeMar DeRozan finished with 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. Jonas Valanciunas recorded a double-double, totaling 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Raptors next game will be on Wednesday, when they host the defensively-sound Memphis Grizzlies.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the New York Knicks 112-103 Monday at Madison Square Garden.

The Thunder (10-8) managed to hand the Knicks (8-8) just their second loss at home this season behind the play of, as always, Russell Westbrook. With 27 points, 18 rebounds and 14 assists, Westbrook notched his third straight triple-double and his eighth of the season. Additionally, his 18 rebounds pushed him over 10 per game for the year, giving him a triple-double average for the second time this season. It wasn't a one-man show, however, as Enes Kanter came off the bench to notch a double-double of 27 points and 10 rebounds in just 28 minutes. Starting center Steven Adams also managed to notch a double-double of his own, posting 14 points and 10 boards. As a team, Oklahoma put together one of their better shooting nights of the season, shooting 51 percent overall from the field.

The same could not be said for New York, however, as the Knicks failed to shoot over 40 percent from the field as a team. Despite that, Derrick Rose managed to put together his best performance of the season, scoring a game-high 30 points on 10-of-20 shooting on top of seven rebounds and four assists. Kristaps Porzingis added 21 points of his own, while Carmelo Anthony struggled mightily, shooting just 4-of-19 from the field en route to 18 points in 34 minutes. Ultimately, while the New York starters played solid, they got little-to-no help from their bench, as the six reserves combined to score just 19 points. 

Up next, the Thunder will head home Wednesday to take on the Wizards, while the Knicks will travel to Minnesota on Wednesday and play the Timberwolves.

They were led by point guard Isaiah Thomas, who, despite having a poor shooting performance from the field, managed to record 25 points, eight assists and four steals in 35 minutes, and his work has a floor leader propelled the Celtics to have 46 assists to just nine turnovers as a team. Fellow starters on the wing Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder recorded 18 and 17 points respectively, but it was the play of Boston's bench that really helped get them to victory, with four reserves managing to score 38 points Monday night. 

For Miami (5-12), they came into Monday's game depleted with injuries, with Dion Waiters (groin), Tyler Johnson (mouth) and Justise Winslow (wrist) all ruled out. Additionally, starting point guard Goran Dragic (elbow) and Hassan Whiteside (knee) were both listed as questionable but managed to play through their ailments. And they were very impressive despite the injuries, with Dragic posting 27 points and 17 assists and Whiteside posting his own double-double of 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting and 17 rebounds. Their efforts, however, were not nearly enough, as the team lacked much of an offensive punch outside of those two. They mainly lacked punch from the outside, as Miami shot just 6-of-30 from behind the arc as a team.

Up next, the Celtics will look to keep rolling at home Wednesday against the Pistons, while the Heat will head to Denver on Wednesday and play the Nuggets.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 104-85 Monday at Spectrum Center. 

The Hornets (10-7) have now won two games in a row after dropping four straight, as they jumped out to 17-point lead at halftime and never let up. They were able to do so thanks in large part to yet another strong performance from Jeremy Lamb, who looks to be fully healthy. In just 23 minutes off the bench, Lamb scored 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting and grabbed nine rebounds. In his two games since returning from injury, Lamb has posted a total of 39 points and 26 rebounds, which has helped provide a spark for what was a sliding Hornets team. Kemba Walker added 21 points of his own , as the two guards led the way for a Charlotte team that struggled to get help from anyone else. 

The Grizzlies (11-7), struggled to get help from anyone at all, as their 85 total points was their third-lowest total in a loss this season. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley were the only starters to reach double figures on a banged up Memphis team, scoring 19 and 14 points respectively. Off the bench, the highlight for the Grizzlies was the solid play of reserve power forward Jarell Martin, who, with Zach Randolph (personal) out, saw 20 minutes off the bench and posted a double-double of 11 points and 12 rebounds in that time. As a team, however, it was a night to forget for Memphis, as they shot just over 40 percent from the field and a poor 7-of-29 (24 percent) from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Hornets will head home Tuesday to take on the Pistons, while the Grizzlies will travel to Toronto on Wednesday to play the Raptors.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves, 112-103, at Target Center on Monday.

This was your stereotypical veteran versus young team and the more experienced squad was able to prevail with a win. It was close throughout though, as there were 10 ties and seven lead changes, with no team leading by more than 11 points. The Jazz won with their interior play, as they scored 60 points in the paint, while holding the Timberwolves to just 44 bench points. Utah shot 51 percent from the field, while Minnesota shot 44 percent on their end.

Utah (10-8) have been getting it done with defense this season, but the offense was on display in this win. George Hill was the player of the game, tallying 24 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Gordon Hayward wasn't far behind, finishing with 24 points, five rebounds and two steals of his own. Rudy Gobert recorded a double-double, totaling 16 points and 17 rebounds. Trey Lyles was a nice spark off the bench, scoring 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting. Utah will have a quick turnaround, as they host the Houston Rockets on Tuesday for their next game. 

Minnesota (5-12) have been a huge disappointment this season and this loss only adds to their struggles. Zach LaVine had one of the best games of his career though, accumulating 28 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Karl-Anthony Towns double-doubled in a 19-point, 12-rebound outing. Andrew Wiggins scored 13 points on 6-of-16 shooting. Ricky Rubio and Gorgui Dieng finished with 11 points a piece. Minnesota will look to play better on Wednesday, when they host the New York Knicks,											",Minnesota,Timberwolves,Utah,Jazz,Target Center,10,8,5,12,7.0,19.0,36.0,81.0,24.0,25.0,39.0,26.0,14.0,4.0,18.0,40.0,79.0,28.0,34.0,42.0,19.0,12.0,Andrew Wiggins,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,34,Gordon Hayward,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,6.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,34,Gorgui Dieng,6.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,31,Boris Diaw,2.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,28,Karl-Anthony Towns,12.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,8.0,19.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,33,Rudy Gobert,17.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,5.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,34,Zach LaVine,8.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,28.0,9.0,17.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,44,Rodney Hood,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,4.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,32,Ricky Rubio,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,25,George Hill,8.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,15.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,34,Nemanja Bjelica,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,26,Joe Johnson,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,15,Kris Dunn,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8,Trey Lyles,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,21,Shabazz Muhammad,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,17,Jeff Withey,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Cole Aldrich,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,Shelvin Mack,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,13,Tyus Jones,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,14,Joe Ingles,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,13

												The host Golden State Warriors defeated the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, 105-100.

Golden State (16-2) has now won 12 straight games and maintains the league's best record.  A large portion of the team's success can be attributed to the strong play of former MVP Kevin Durant, who posted 25 points and 14 rebounds on Monday.  All-Star forward Draymond Green showcased his impact as well, coming up with multiple crucial blocks down the stretch.  The Warriors were able to establish a lead early in the fourth with a quick 8-0 run while Hawks center Dwight Howard sat on the bench.  Atlanta was unable to regain the lead for the remainder of the night.  The All-Star backcourt of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 45 points in the contest, with 21 of those points coming on three-pointers.

Atlanta (10-8), meanwhile, is now 1-6 in its last seven contests after a hot start to the season.  The team exhibited dominance on the boards in Monday's matchup, out-rebounding the Warriors 51-41, but could not make anything happen from beyond the arc.  While Golden State hit 12 three-pointers on 34 percent shooting, Atlanta hit only seven on just 25 percent.  Forward Kent Bazemore struggled in particular, shooting 0-of-6 from three-point range.  The Hawks did see solid shooting from Howard, who posted 14 points on 5-of-8 from the field.

The Hawks will visit Phoenix on Wednesday, while Golden State will host the Houston Rockets on Thursday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 112-108, at Wells Fargo Center on Sunday. 

Considering the Cavs (13-2) came in to Sunday as one of the hottest offensive teams in the league, the start to the contest could hardly have been more auspicious. Cleveland misfired on their first 14 shots and the Sixers (4-13) capitalized to build a 30-24 lead after one quarter. The visitors began to claw their way back in the second period, but still entered halftime trailing by a surprising 58-52 margin. However, they used intermission to regroup, as they outscored their hosts in the second half by a 60-50 margin, doing just enough to overcome their deficit and hang on to a slim advantage. Kyrie Irving was superb in keying the win, scoring a team-leading 39 points that he supplemented with four rebounds and two assists, while LeBron James and Kevin Love combined for 51 points of their own.

James compiled 26 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for his second triple-double of the season, both of which have come in the last three games. Love tallied 25 points, 11 rebounds and an assist. Tristan Thompson culled together a 12-point, 12-rebound double-double. J.R. Smith's epic shooting struggles continued, as he went scoreless (along with five rebounds and an assist) over 39 minutes on an 0-for-11 shooting tally, making him 1-of-22 from the field over his last two games. 

The Sixers were paced by Joel Embiid, who supplied 22 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Ersan Ilyasova and Gerald Henderson managed a pair of 13-point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds and an assist and the latter contributing five rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block. Sergio Rodriguez got the start at point guard and registered 12 points, seven assists, two rebounds and two steals. The bench was highly productive as well, posting a collective 40 points. They were led by Jahlil Okafor's 14-point total, while Nik Stauskas and Dario Saric totaled 11 and 10 points, respectively. 

The Cavs now travel to Milwaukee for a Tuesday night tilt versus the Bucks, while the Sixers head north of the border to face the Toronto Raptors on Monday night.

												The visiting Denver Nuggets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 120-114, on Sunday afternoon.

Forward Wilson Chandler led Denver (7-10) with 25 points after posting a team-high 32 on Friday night against OKC.  Chandler continues to enjoy a featured role due to injuries to wings Danilo Gallinari and Will Barton.  The forward helped contribute to Denver's early lead on Sunday, as the team entered halftime up 20 points.  Phoenix was able to rally somewhat, however, narrowing the lead by 13 points during the third quarter.  Denver, the league's top rebounding team, saw a challenge on the glass in the Suns' Tyson Chandler, who pulled down a game-high 15 boards.  The Nuggets were still able to maintain a slight rebounding advantage, recording 49 rebounds to Phoenix's 46.  A combined 40 points for Denver's starting backcourt and a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double off the bench for Nikola Jokic helped Denver maintain the lead on the scoreboard.   

Phoenix (5-13), meanwhile, saw top-notch performances from both members of its starting backcourt.  Eric Bledsoe scored a season-high 35 points while knocking down all 11 of his free-throw attempts.  Bledsoe also recorded six rebounds, six assists, two steals, and two blocks.  Booker, meanwhile, scored 30 points and had just one turnover.  The Suns struggled with efficiency, though, shooting just 40 percent from the field as a team.  Phoenix had issues with ball movement as well, recording just 11 assists as a team.  

The Nuggets will host the Heat and the Suns will host the Hawks on Wednesday.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Brooklyn Nets 122-105 at Golden 1 Center on Sunday. 

The Kings (7-10) ran away with their seventh win of the season in the third quarter against the Nets (4-12). After Brooklyn took a four point lead into the second quarter, the Kings bounced back and went into the half down just one point. DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay went to work in the third quarter on both ends of the floor, where the Kings outscored the Nets 34-18 and did not have to look back the rest of the contest. The Nets only managed three points in the last four minutes of that third quarter, while  the Kings picked up the pace in transition and capped off a double digit scoring run. 

Cousins led the way with 37 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, four steals and one block, while Rudy Gay poured in 22 points of his own, to go along with eight boards and eight assists. Cousins was dominant from every inch of the floor, and that included an impressive 4-of-5 from behind the arc and 7-of-9 from the free throw line. The Nets had no response once Cousins got going, and the floor being spaced favored Rudy Gay to work off the dribble. 

Four Nets starters finished in double figures including Sean Kilpatrick, who led the Nets in that department with 22 points, to go along with five rebounds and three assists. Kilpatrick and Isaiah Whitehead, the Seton Hall product, were the only two players on the Nets to finish with a positive plus-minus. 

The Kings play the second game of a back-to-back when they visit the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Nets host the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Orlando Magic 104-96 at Amway Center on Sunday. 

The Bucks (7-8) pulled out a victory that was relatively close from end-to-end, but capitalized by a well rounded performance from point guard Giannis Antetokounmpo and three bench players scoring in double figures. The aforementioned point guard made a two-foot layup with just one second remaining at the end of the first quarter, which gave the Bucks a 36-29 lead. A pair of C.J. Watson free throws for the Magic (6-11) cut the Bucks lead to four points midway through the second period, but Milwaukee was able to stave off Orlando from tying the game until Evan Fournier’s two point jump shot in the third quarter, which tied the game at 60 point a piece. The Bucks played smart basketball down the stretch, working the shot clock in their favor and relied on efficient rotations from their bench players to come away with the road win. 

Antetokounmpo finished with 18 points, nine rebounds, four assists, three blocks and one steal on 7-of-11 shooting across 31 minutes. John Henson added 20 points and seven boards to lead the Bucks in scoring, while Michael Beasley, Greg Monroe Malcolm Brogdon finished double figures on the bench. Fournier led the Magic with 27 points, six rebounds, seven assists, two steals and just one turnover on 11-of-21 shooting. Orlando only went three players deep on the bench, requiring a lot of minutes from Nikola Vucevic, C.J. Watson and Elfrid Payton. All but Watson (0-of-6 shooting) were effective in their play, but were unable to aid the starters in fueling a comeback down the stretch. 

Both teams have tough contests on Tuesday, as the Magic visit the San Antonio Spurs, while the Bucks host the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 91-70, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday,

The Clippers have been playing some dominant basketball this season, but this was a dud against a desperate Pacers team. Indiana stifled them with their defense, holding them to 70 points on 31 percent from the field and 17 percent from three-point range.  The assist-to-turnover ratio was a huge factor as well, with Indiana recording 26 assists to just 14 turnovers and Los Angeles committing 20 turnovers to just 11 assists. Those numbers allowed the Pacers to take 22 more shots than the Clippers, making nearly twice as many shots. 

Los Angeles (14-4) has been one of the best teams early on in the season, but they really struggled here. Blake Griffin led the team in scoring, tallying 16 points and nine rebounds on 6-of-15 shooting. Chris Paul also struggled with his shot, totaling 13 points, four rebounds and four assists on 4-of-11 from the field. The only other player in double figures was Jamal Crawford, who scored 12 points off the bench. DeAndre Jordan grabbed 14 rebounds, adding eight points to his line.  Los Angeles will look to play better on Tuesday against the Brooklyn Nets,

Indiana (9-9) had to play this game without Paul George (ankle), but they didn't miss a beat. Myles Turner was the player of the game, accruing 17 points and 12 rebounds in the win. Glenn Robinson III also scored 17 points, filling-in for George. Jeff Teague scored just seven points, but dished out 10 assists, Al Jefferson and Rodney Stuckey were nice sparks off the bench, accumulating 28 points and 13 rebounds between the two. Indiana will look to get above .500 in their next matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The host Dallas Mavericks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 91-81, at American Airlines Center on Sunday. 

To say these teams struggled on the offensive end in this matchup would be an understatement. Dallas had one of their best defensive games of the season though, holding New Orleans to just 39 percent from the field and 25 percent from three-point range. The Mavericks shot 42 percent from the field on their end and 37 percent from three-point range. The Mavericks really turned it on late, outscoring New Orleans, 31-21, in the fourth quarter. All the statistics were even, as assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, points in the paint and fouls were all within two of one another. 

New Orleans (6-12) has been riding the back of Anthony Davis in their current hot streak, but he couldn't quite do enough to carry them here. Davis still finished with a game-high 36 points and 13 rebounds in the defeat. No other starter scored more than nine points, with the other four starters combining for 19 points in all. Jrue Holiday had another nice game off the bench, totaling 17 points, four rebounds and six assists. No other player on the roster had more than nine points, five rebounds or three assists. The Pelicans will host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday for their next game. 

Dallas (3-13) came into this game with the lowest-scoring offense in the NBA, but they did just enough to crack their eight-game losing streak. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks in scoring, tallying 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Wesley Matthews was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 21 points, three rebounds and three assists. Justin Anderson provided 14 points and eight rebounds off the bench. Andrew Bogut scored just five points on three shots, but grabbed 14 rebounds as the starting center. It will be tough for Dallas to add to this win, as they play the San Antonio Spurs on the road for their next game.

												The visiting Houston Rockets defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 130-114, on Sunday night.

James Harden once again led the Rockets (11-6) in scoring and assists, posting 38 and 10 respectively.  Harden has seen his assist numbers skyrocket  since the arrival of new head coach Mike D'Antoni, and the trend continued on Sunday.  Despite playing the role of distributor, Harden took a team-high 22 shots, making 11, and also got to the line 13 times.  While the superstar was the focal point of Houston's run-and-gun offense, multiple other Rockets made heavy contributions.  Guard Eric Gordon scored 26 points off the bench, including six three-pointers, while starter Clint Capela scored 21 on 9-of-12 shooting.  The team was able to hit 17 three-pointers on the night, just a game after hitting 21 on an NBA-record 50 attempts.  Houston shot over 56 percent from the field.

Despite hanging close through three quarters, Portland (10-9) let the game slip away in the fourth quarter.  Though the team shot a respectable 48 percent from the field, the Blazers struggled on the defensive end, allowing a three-point barrage for Houston.  Blazers star Damian Lillard was unable to shoot Portland out of its deficit, going just 7-of-20 from the field.  Lillard was still able to contribute 27 points, however.  Guard C.J. McCollum, meanwhile, scored a team-high 28 points to go with seven assists and two steals.  

The Rockets will visit Utah on Tuesday, while the Blazers will host the Pacers on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 109-94, at Staples Center on Sunday night.

The Lakers (9-9) have rightfully been lauded for their marked improvement under new head coach Luke Walton in the early going, and their performance on Sunday did nothing to detract from that narrative. Los Angeles saw its second unit rise to the occasion on a night where the starting five was sluggish offensively, as they contributed well over half of their scoring total with a 65-point tally. Lou Williams posted a team-high 21 points and added four rebounds and three assists in 27 minutes off the bench to lead the way, while two other reserves also reached double digits in the scoring column. The Lakers' most impressive quarter was the second, as they rebounded from a 32-21 first-quarter deficit to outpace the Hawks (10-7) by a 35-16 margin. 

Kent Bazemore led Atlanta with 21 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. Dwight Howard came within a rebound of a double-double, supplying 19 points, nine boards, three assists, two blocks and a steal. Dennis Schroder was next with 11 points, eight assists, four rebounds, a steal and a block. Paul Millsap had a modest game by his standards, registering nine points, five rebounds and three assists.

Jordan Clarkson was right behind Williams on the Lakers with 18 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals in 32 minutes off the bench. Nick Young totaled 17 points, a rebound and a steal as the only starter to manage double-digit scoring. Larry Nance, Jr. was the third reserve to post a particularly productive outing, as he managed a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists. 

The Hawks continue their West Coast swing with a visit to the Golden State Warriors on Monday night, while the Lakers head to New Orleans to face the Pelicans on Tuesday evening.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs defeated the Washington Wizards, 112-100, at Verizon Center on Saturday.

LaMarcus Aldridge had seen a string of three consecutive 20-point efforts come to an end on Friday night versus the Celtics, when he'd mustered a modest 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. However, his resurgent effort Saturday helped keep the Spurs (14-3) perfect on the road, as he paced the team with 24 points, seven rebounds and a steal. His performance spearheaded a 53.3 percent tally from the field overall for San Antonio, which helped overcome a strong night from the Wizards' starting five.

Tony Parker served as Aldridge's wing man on the night, as he posted 20 points, three assists and a rebound. Kawhi Leonard was right behind him with 19 points, five assists, a rebound and three steals. Pau Gasol had a redemptive showing of his own, as he supplied eight points, 10 rebounds, two assists and a steal after going scoreless over 17 minutes against the Celtics on Friday. Jonathan Simmons led the bench with 15 points, four assists, a rebound, two steals and a block, while Patty Mills finished with 13 points, four assists and three rebounds in a reserve role as well. 

The Wizards (5-10) saw all members of the starting five reach double figures in the scoring column. Bradley Beal led the way with 25 points, six rebounds, five assists and two steals. John Wall was next with 21 points, five assists, three rebounds and a steal. Otto Porter contributed 14 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals. Markieff Morris checked in with a 12-point effort, while Marcin Gortat rounded things out with a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the visiting New York Knicks, 107-102, at Spectrum Center on Saturday.

After playing a competitive game on Friday, these two teams put up a similar fight on Saturday. The game flow was a bit different though, as there were only six combined lead changes and ties after nearly 40 on Friday. Charlotte got out to a hot start, as they led 38-22 after the first quarter. New York fought back to take their first and only lead in the fourth quarter, but couldn't quite hold off a late fury by the Hornets. Defense was key for Charlotte, as they held New York to 38 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range. The Hornets also took advantage of the whistle, taking 21 more free-throw attempts than the Knicks. 

New York (8-8) had the tough task of winning both games of a home-and-home set and they did all they could to hang around in this tight loss. Kristaps Porzingis led the team in scoring, dropping 25 points and grabbing six boards. Derrick Rose fell just shy of a triple-double, accumulating 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Carmelo Anthony also scored 18 points, adding eight rebounds on an ugly 7-of-25 shooting. On deck for the Knicks is a home matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.  

Charlotte (9-7) had to play this game extremely shorthanded, but they got some huge performances from unexpected sources. Jeremy Lamb was the biggest surprise, as he scored a season-high 18 points and grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds in his first start with the Hornets. Kemba Walker led the team in scoring, tallying 28 points, three assists and three blocks in the win. Cody Zeller recorded a double-double, totaling 11 points and 10 rebounds. Starters Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams both sat out this game with differing injuries. The Hornets will return to action on Monday, when they play the Memphis Grizzlies on the road.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 106-88, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday.

The Thunder (10-8) had every reason to be a bit sluggish Saturday, after a marathon 132-129 overtime victory over the Nuggets on Friday. However, while they didn't quite put on the offensive display of a night prior, Oklahoma City rode Russell Westbrook's sixth triple-double of the season to another win. The perennial All-Star was only 8-of-22 from the floor but still managed 17 points, 15 assists, 13 rebounds, a steal and a block. It was the 44th time in his career that Westbrook had accomplished the feat, tying him with LeBron James. The Thunder's starting five also got some much-needed offensive support from the bench, as they posted a collective 48 points.

Tobias Harris spearheaded Detroit (8-10) with 21 points, four rebounds, an assist and three steals. Ish Smith posted 14 points, three assists and a rebound. A trio of 10-point efforts from Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Andre Drummond rounded out the starting five's night. Jon Leuer led the bench with eight points and three rebounds. The Pistons were historically futile from behind the arc, as they managed a minuscule 5.3 percent success rate (1-of-19).

Victor Oladipo actually led the Thunder in scoring with 18 points, a total that he supplemented with six rebounds, two assists and a steal. Steven Adams had a near double-double with 16 points, nine boards and a steal. Anthony Morrow was outstanding off the bench with 21 points, a rebound and an assist over 26 minutes. Enes Kanter was also productive in a reserve role with 12 points and three rebounds.

The Pistons travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Tuesday, while the Thunder square off with the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Monday evening.

												The visiting Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Miami Heat, 110-107, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday. 

In a battle between two defensive-minded teams, offense was on display. In fact, both teams show over 49 percent from the field and there were only 16 combined turnovers and 19 combined steals/blocks. Those are extremely low numbers and it comes as a big surprise with these inefficient offenses squaring off. Free-throw shooting was key for the Grizzlies, as they went 27-of-33 to the Heat's 16-of-24. The assist-to-turnover differential was huge as well, with Memphis recording 23 assists-to-six turnovers, while Miami recorded just 18 assists-to-10 turnovers. There were five ties and 13 lead changes, with no team leading by double-digits for the entirety of the game. 

Memphis (11-6) have been thriving off their elite defense lately, but the offense was key in this victory. Marc Gasol was the player of the game, as he tied a season-high with 28 points, adding three rebounds and six assists to his tally. Troy Williams got the first start of his rookie campaign and scored a career-high 18 points in a career-high 35 minutes. Tony Allen also got a rare start, totaling 11 points and eight rebounds in the win. Mike Conley finished the game with 21 points and seven assists, hitting numerous big shots in the fourth quarter. On deck for Memphis is a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday. 

Miami (5-11) had to play this game without Goran Dragic and Justise Winslow, but they fought to the final whistle. In fact, all five starters scored in double figures, with none of them shooting below 40 percent from the field. Dion Waiters stepped up in Dragic's absence, accumulating a team-high 28 points, five rebounds and six assists. Hassan Whiteside recorded another double-double despite dealing with foul trouble, scoring 15 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the defeat. Josh Richardson amassed 15 points, three rebounds and five assists, but missed a game-tying three at the buzzer. Miami will host the Boston Celtics for their next game on Monday.

												The Golden State Warriors earned their 11th win in a row as they defeated the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves 115-102 on Saturday night at Oracle Arena. 

The Timberwolves came out strong on the second night of a back-to-back, leading 33-30 after one quarter, however they significantly dropped-off in the second and third quarters where they were out-scored 60-40. They fought back in the fourth but it was not enough as Golden State cruised to the win. The Warriors were also on the second night of a back-to-back, and were missing Draymond Green due to an ankle contusion that he suffered the previous night. 

The Warriors (15-2) got their 11th-straight win but saw their franchise-high 30-assist streak come to an end at 10-games as they tallied 25 assists on their 45-made field goals. Stephen Curry finished with a game-high 34 points, while Kevin Durant followed up with 28 and Klay Thompson added 23, to combine for 85 points. Kevon Looney started in place of the injured Draymond Green and finished with six points, three rebounds, two assists and one steal, in 18 minutes. The Warriors are now 6-1 at home and can improve on that as they look forward to the second game of a five-game home stand on Monday versus the Hawks. 

After a solid win in Phoenix, the Timberwolves (5-11) slipped back into their old ways with a good start and then a lull period in the middle quarters. Karl-Anthony Towns was a good example of that as he scored 12 points in the first quarter and then did not score again until the final four minutes of the third quarter, only to finish the game with 18 points. Zach LaVine led the way offensively for Minnesota, with 31 points, while Andrew Wiggins chipped in 16 points. The Timberwolves have lost four of their last five games and fall to 2-7 on the road, however they head back home for two games, beginning with the Jazz on Monday.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs defeated the Boston Celtics, 109-103, at TD Center on Friday. 

The Spurs (13-3) put together a strong effort over the final three quarters after falling in a first-quarter hole to keep their road record unblemished. The Celtics (9-7) jumped out to a 32-22 advantage after the first 12 minutes, but San Antonio outscored their hosts by an 87-71 margin over the final three periods. Kawhi Leonard led the way with a 25-point, 10-rebound double-double, while the Spurs' second unit combined for 56 points, over half of the team's scoring total. The visitors were solid all the way around offensively, tallying respective 46.9 and 45.8 percent success rates from the field and three-point range. 

Leonard added four assists and two blocks to his team-high scoring total. Next among the starters was Danny Green, who posted 11 points, seven rebounds, two assists and four blocks. His final rejection of the afternoon was the most important, as he stuffed an Isaiah Thomas 25-foot three-point attempt with 12 seconds left to insure the Celtics were kept at bay. LaMarcus Aldridge totaled 10 points, four rebounds, four assists and a block. Pau Gasol notably went scoreless over 17 minutes, but he did contribute five rebounds, two assists and a block. The bench more than made up for any scoring void on the part of the starting five, however, as Patty Mills led the way with 19 points, a rebound, an assist and a steal. Meanwhile, David Lee and Davis Bertans combined for a pair of 15-point efforts, with the former also hauling in 12 rebounds and dishing out three assists. 

The Celtics were led by Thomas' 24 points, which he supplemented with eight assists and a rebound. Avery Bradley contributed 19 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Jae Crowder supplied 18 points, five assists, three rebounds and a steal. Al Horford registered a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and and three blocks. Kelly Olynyk and Marcus Smart paced the bench with a  pair of nine-point efforts.

The Spurs continue their travels with a visit to Washington to take on the Wizards on Saturday night, while the Celtics are off until they face off with the Miami Heat on Monday night.

												The visiting Washington Wizards defeated the Orlando Magic, 94-91, at Amway Center on Friday. 

The Wizards (5-9) rode another double-double from John Wall and a balanced and productive effort from their starting five overall to tally their first road win of the season. Wall led the way with 26 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and three steals over 39 minutes, his third double-double in the last four games. The remaining four members of the first unit all managed double digits in the scoring column as well, leading to a solid 45.5 percent performance from the field. Meanwhile, on the defensive side of the ball, Washington elicited 19 turnovers from the Magic (6-10), while only committing 11 of their own. The collective effort helped overcome a breakout performance by Orlando's Nikola Vucevic, who posted a 17-point, 17-rebound double-double on 8-of-16 shooting.

Otto Porter was second to Wall, turning in a solid 19 points, seven rebounds and a pair of assists. Bradley Beal checked in with 14 points, eight assists, two rebounds and a steal. Marcin Gortat was just short of a double-double, totaling 12 points, nine rebounds and two assists. Markieff Morris did a little bit of everything while rounding out the starting five's productive night, posting 11 points, three rebounds, two assists, three steals and a block.

Vucevic added two assists, three steals and three blocks to his superb all-around effort. Serge Ibaka actually led the Magic in scoring with 19 points, and he added eight rebounds, two assists, a steal and four blocks. Elfrid Payton supplied 15 points, five rebounds and five assists. Evan Fournier had a rough night from the field, going just 2-of-9, and provided a modest 11 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal. Former starter Aaron Gordon led the second unit with nine points, seven rebounds and an assist.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Dallas Mavericks, 128-90, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday.

Almost from the opening tip, the game looked like the mismatch it had been expected to be. The Mavs (2-13) held an early 2-0 lead before Cleveland (12-2) systematically began to exert their dominance. They held a 36-16 advantage by the end of the first quarter, and a whopping 72-38 lead by halftime. Four of the five members of the first unit posted double-digit scoring, and the team posted an excellent 50.6 percent success rate from the field overall, and an equally impressive 46.5 percent tally from beyond the arc. 

Dallas saw Dirk Nowitzki lead the way in only his second game back from an eight-game absence due to an Achilles injury, as he registered 15 points, six rebounds and three assists. Harrison Barnes was the only other member of the first unit with double digits in the scoring column, as he collected 12 points and added five boards. Wesley Matthews, Deron Williams and Andrew Bogut could only combine for 12 points overall on 5-of-17 shooting. Seth Curry received 26 minutes off the bench in the blowout and supplied 13 points, four rebounds and three assists.

Kevin Love continued his stretch of excellent play, leading the way for the Cavs with a 27-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists and three steals. Kyrie Irving was next with a stat line that was almost entirely comprised of scoring, as he managed 25 points but only a rebound, an assist and a block. LeBron James compiled a 19-point, 11-assist double-double that also included five rebounds and a steal. Tristan Thompson posted his own double-double with 11 points, 12 rebounds, an assist and a steal. J.R. Smith was notably the only Cleveland player to struggle, totaling only three points on a 1-of-11 shooting effort. 

The Mavs return home to face off with the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, while the Cavs visit the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday afternoon.

												The New York Knicks defeated the visiting Charlotte Hornets in overtime, 113-111, at Madison Square Garden on Friday. 

Overtime usually indicates a close game and the stats show just that. In fact, there were 17 ties and 22 lead changes in this close matchup. The third quarter was strange though, as the Hornets got out to a 15-6 start and allowed the Knicks to follow that up with a 22-5 run to end the quarter. From there, it was even until the final whistle. Carmelo Anthony was the star, as he hit the game-winning shot with three second left, en route to a season-high 35 points. Free-throw shooting was a huge factor, with New York going 12-of-13, to Charlotte's 17-of-27. The Knicks also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle 55-46. 

Charlotte (8-7) has now lost four-straight and this was easily the most painful defeat in that stretch. Nicolas Batum did all he could, as he accumulated 18 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. Kemba Walker wasn't far behind, as he tallied 17 points, five rebounds, three assists and four steals of his own. Cody Zeller was the final starter in double figures, totaling 15 points and six rebounds. Marco Belinelli was a huge spark off the bench, scoring 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Frank Kaminsky went just 3-of-14 from the field, but finished with 13 points and nine rebounds off the pine. 

New York (8-7) has been playing better recently and wins like this only give them more momentum going forward. Anthony was the star, as he accrued a season-high 35 points and 14 rebounds in the win. Derrick Rose tallied 16 points, three rebounds and five assists of his own. Kristaps Porzingis also scored 16 points, adding eight rebounds and three blocks to his stat line. 

These teams will have to face off once again on Saturday, as they play the finale of a rare home-and-home, back-to-back set.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Philadelphia 76ers, 105-89, at Wells Fargo Center on Friday.

The Bulls were a projected nine-point road favorite headed into this matchup and they showed why in this dominating win. Chicago took a 10-point lead headed into the half, but really opened it up with a 33-17 third quarter. This was the rare wire-to-wire win, with the Bulls leading by as much as 28 points at times in their victory. Chicago was clicking on all cylinders, as they shot over 44 percent from the field and held the Sixers to under 40 percent shooting. The Bulls also won the turnover battle, 19-12, and the rebounding battle, 51-48.

Chicago (10-6) got to close up their unenvious circus road trip in this victory, as they finished it with a franchise-best 4-2 record. Jimmy Butler continued his sparkling play, as he dropped 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting. Dwyane Wade also scored 26 points, doing that on 11-of-18 shooting. Rajon Rondo likely would have triple-doubled if he played the fourth quarter, as he finished with six points, eight rebounds and 10 assists in 25 minutes. The Bulls will be off until Wednesday, when they host the Los Angeles Lakers for their next game.

Philadelphia (4-12) have been playing better recently, but this game was well out of hand early on. Ersan Ilyasova led the team in scoring, tallying 14 points and seven rebounds on 6-of-9 shooting. Nik Stauskas was the best bench player, accruing 13 points, five rebounds, three assists and three blocks. Richaun Holmes also provided 14 points, five rebounds and three blocks off the bench. Jerryd Bayless totaled 11 points, four rebounds and two assists in his first start of the season. Things don't get any easier for the Sixers, as they host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday for their next game.

												The host Detroit Pistons defeated the league-best Los Angeles Clippers, 108-97, on Friday night.

Detroit (8-9) has been nearly unstoppable at home this season, advancing to 7-2 in Michigan with Friday's win.  Strong shooting helped bolster the team's performance, as the Pistons shot over 52 percent from the field.  Every starter recorded at least 15 points in what was a well-rounded team performance for the group.  While league-best rebounder Andre Drummond dipped below his season average and posted just 10 rebounds, the team held a sizable 42-32 advantage on the glass.  Drummond was a force inside, scoring 16 points and shooting 8-of-11 from the field.  

Los Angeles (14-3) had not lost on the road prior to Friday's game.  The Clippers saw their offense slow due to a rare off night from point guard Chris Paul, who dished out 15 assists but shot just 2-of-9 for eight points.  Guard Jamal Crawford, generally an integral spark plug for the Clippers, shot just 4-of-12.  Guard J.J. Redick and forward Blake Griffin led the team with 24 points each, though Griffin recorded just three rebounds.  Double-double machine DeAndre Jordan recorded just nine rebounds, contributing heavily to LA's deficit on the glass.

The Clippers will face the Pacers on Sunday, while Detroit will have a weekend of rest.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the visiting Atlanta Hawks, 95-68, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Friday. 

The Hawks rarely get blown out, but they ran into a buzz saw here with a trip to Utah. The Jazz held the Hawks to just 31 percent shooting and a season-low 68 points. Atlanta really struggled in the middle quarters, scoring just 25 combined points in the second and third quarters. Rebounding was key for Utah, as they won that battle, 55-40. The Jazz held the dynamic Atlanta starters to just 37 points on 14-of-51 shooting. 

Atlanta (8-6) is in a bit of a slump right now and they'll hope this blowout loss is rock-bottom. Dennis Schroder led the team in scoring, as he recorded 16 points and three steals on an inefficient 6-of-19 shooting. Paul Millsap was the only other starter with more than four points, as he tallied 11 points and five rebounds on 5-of-11 shooting. Thabo Sefolosha led the bench, dropping 11 points and seven rebounds. Atlanta will look to play better on Sunday in a road matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers. 

Utah (9-8) have the number-one defense headed into this matchup and they showed why in this blowout win. Gordon Hayward led the Jazz in scoring, totaling 24 points and seven rebounds. George Hill was one point shy of Hayward, as he finished with 23 points and five rebounds of his own. Rudy Gobert took just two shots, but finished with a 10-point, 10-rebound, five-block double-double. Trey Lyles also recorded a double-double, amassing 13 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Utah will be off until Monday, when they play the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 105-99, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday. 

This was one of those rare instances in which it was a close game, with very few lead changes or ties. In fact, no team led by more than 10 points, with only five ties and four lead changes being accounted for. With that said, Toronto led for nearly the entirety of the game, with the Bucks never leading by more than two points. All the statistics favor the Bucks, as they won the shooting percentage, rebounding battle, fastbreak points, points in the paint and assist-to-turnover ratio. A big factor for Milwaukee was their poor free-throw shooting, as they shot 58 percent on 12 attempts, to 79 percent on 19 attempts for Toronto. 

Toronto (10-6) was dominated in many of the statistics, but they won the one that mattered most. DeMar DeRozan continued his scoring exhibition, as he tallied 26 points, seven rebounds and four assists on 9-of-18 shooting. Kyle Lowry was second on the team, accumulating 19 points, five rebounds, six assists and two steals in the victory. Jonas Valanciunas finished with 12 points, while DeMarre Carroll scored 14. Strangely, no player on Toronto finished with more than seven rebounds, six assists or two steals in their win. Toronto is off until Monday, when they host the Philadelphia 76ers for their next game. 

Milwaukee (6-8) played a better game than Toronto, but they simply couldn't escape with a much needed win. Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load, accruing a game-high 29 points, six rebounds and 11 assists. Tony Snell was second on the team, scoring 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting. Mathew Dellavedova tallied 11 points, three rebounds and eight assists. Greg Monroe finally got some run off the bench, totaling eight points and 10 rebounds in 18 minutes. On deck for the Bucks is a road matchup against the Orlando Magic on Sunday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, 90-81, at FedEx Forum.

Miami (5-10) has struggled this season after experiencing major roster losses in free agency.  On Friday, however, the team was able to put together a strong defensive effort to earn the win.  The Heat held the Grizzlies to just 35 percent from the field and only four three-pointers.  League-leading shot-blocker Hassan Whiteside blocked another two shots in Friday's win.  On offense, meanwhile, young guard Tyler Johnson scored 22 off the bench to lead the team.  Johnson was re-signed by the Heat as a restricted free agent after signing a large offer sheet with the Brooklyn Nets this summer.  The guard showed his value on Friday, scoring a team-high and also grabbing six rebounds and two steals.

Memphis (10-6), meanwhile, saw disappointing performances across the board on Friday.  Star center Marc Gasol went for just nine points and one rebound on the night.  Only two Grizzlies scored in double-digits and the team high was only 16 points.  The Grizzlies starting five recorded just 30 points combined.  As a whole, the team shot only 35 percent and turned the ball over 17 teams, in what was a bleak offensive showing for a normally high-level team.  

The two teams will rematch in Miami on Saturday.

												The Indiana Pacers demolished the visiting Brooklyn Nets, 118-97, at Bankers Life Field House on Friday.

Despite the absence of star forward Paul George with a back injury, Indiana (8-9) was able to run away with Friday's game early on.  The Pacers hopped out to a 15-point halftime lead which reached 27 by the end of the third quarter.  Guard Glenn Robinson III stepped into the starting lineup in George's absence and impressed, playing 40 minutes while no other Pacer saw more than 26.  Robinson led the team in scoring with 20 points and shot 6-of-10 on the night while pulling down six rebounds.  Overall, the Pacers saw brilliant offense, shooting over 55 percent from the field and knocking down 11 three-pointers.  On defense, sophomore center Myles Turner stepped up and delivered four blocks and a steal.

Brooklyn (4-11) started a highly promising 4-5 after many projections had them finishing near the bottom of the league.  The team seems to be slowing down, however, as Friday's loss marked their sixth straight.  Point guard Jeremy Lin remains out with a hamstring injury, forcing rookie Isaiah Whitehead into the starting lineup.  Whitehead scored just four points on 1-of-5 shooting on Friday.  Veteran Brook Lopez once again led the Nets in scoring, racking up 20 points on the night.  The team is now just 2-8 with Lin out of the lineup and 1-7 away from Brooklyn.

The Nets will host the Kings and the Pacers will host the Clippers on Sunday.

												The visiting Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Denver Nuggets, 132-127, in overtime Friday at Pepsi Center.

Russell Westbrook led the Thunder (9-8) to victory with his sixth triple-double of the season on Friday.  The league-leading scorer posted a game-high 36 points to go with 12 rebounds and 18 assists.  The point guard was one assist shy of his career high.  Westbrook continues to lead the Thunder in scoring, rebounds, and assists 17 games into the season.  The Thunder badly needed Friday's win after losing seven of their previous nine games.  In addition to Westbrook, guard Victor Oladipo delivered an impressive 26 points on 11-of-19 shooting.  Bench big man Joffrey Lauvergne, a former Nugget, contributed 15 points off the bench.

Denver (6-10) was missing starter Danilo Gallinari with a thigh injury, but saw high levels of offensive output nonetheless.  Forward Wilson Chandler led the team with 30 points, while rookie Jamal Murray came off the bench for 20.  Murray struggled in overtime, however, turning the ball over and air balling a critical shot.  The Nuggets came into the game as the league's top rebounding team and showed it off against another rebounding giant.  Denver held a 51-40 advantage on the glass in the game.  The team dished 34 assists on the offensive end as well.  

OKC will host the Pistons Saturday, while the Nuggets will visit Phoenix on Sunday.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves snapped a three-game losing streak as they defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 98-85, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Friday. 

The Timberwolves (5-10) had been struggling to finish-off games after good starts, but broke that trend as they out-scored the Suns 51-33 in the second half, while holding the Suns to only 10 points in the fourth quarter and scoreless for the last three minutes of the game. Minnesota led 29-27 after the first quarter but squandered the lead with a poor second quarter, only to come back and earn a much-needed win. All five starters scored in double digits for the Timberwolves, led by Andrew Wiggins who snapped-out of a three-game scoring slump by pouring in 25 points, including going 10-of-11 from the foul line. Karl-Anthony Towns followed-up with 22 points, 10 rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block, in 35 minutes. The Timberwolves will face the second night of a back-to-back as they wind-up a three-game road trip in Golden State on Saturday.
 
The Suns (5-12) were leading 75-67 after three quarters, but fell apart in the fourth, with their lowest scoring quarter of the season, with 10 points on 12.5 percent shooting from field. Tyson Chandler was back in the line-up after missing eight of the last nine games and was solid in 11 minutes off the bench, with six points and seven rebounds. Meanwhile, Eric Bledsoe notched his eighth 20-point game of the season as he led the way for Phoenix with 23 points, 10 assists, six rebounds and three steals. The Suns went 6-of-26 from long range and 15-of-21 from the free throw line as their offense hit a rough patch. Next, Phoenix hosts the Nuggets on Sunday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 109-85, on Friday at Staple Center. 

This was the second game of a home-and-home series between the Lakers and Warriors that resulted in two wins for the Warriors. Golden State came out in the last game with an 80-point first half as they looked to make a point against the team that had upset them early in the season. Since their loss to the Lakers early in the season, the Warriors have now won 10 games in a row, while setting a franchise-record with their 10th game with 30 assists or more. 

The Warriors (14-2) started off strong with a 30-20 first quarter. They tied the second quarter, with both teams scoring 23 but Golden State went on to dominate the final two quarters and cruise to victory. The win did come at a price though as Draymond Green left the game with an ankle tweak, and Ian Clark left after being accidentally hit in the throat. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant led the Warriors in scoring with 29 points, along with nine assists and six rebounds, in 33 minutes, while Stephen Curry added 24 points and Klay Thompson chipped in 18, as the three combined for a modest 71 points. The Warriors will have short rest before their next game in Minnesota on Saturday.

The Lakers (8-9) were short-handed in this one, missing D'Angelo Russell (knee), Julius Randal (hip) and Nick Young (toe). Jordan Clarkson was the high-point man for Los Angeles, with 20 points, on 6-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-9 from deep, in 38 minutes. The only other players to score in double figures for the Lakers were Larry Nance Jr., with 11 and Lou Williams with 13. Los Angeles shot 35.6 percent from the field as a team and only 5-of-22 from deep as it was stifled by the Warriors. Next the Lakers play host to the Hawks on Sunday.

												The Houston Rockets fended off a strong second half from Sacramento to defeat the host Kings, 117-104, on Friday at Golden 1 Center. 

The Rockets (10-6) started out strong with a 68-point first half and headed into the locker room up by 18. The Kings (6-10) battled back in the second half but it was too little too late as the Rockets cruised to their fourth win in five games. 

James Harden struggled a bit offensively, shooting 6-of-18 on his was to 23 points, but rounded out his stat line with 10 assists and 10 rebounds to notch the triple-double, in 40 minutes. Trevor Ariza tallied 18 points, nine rebounds, three assists and two steals in a complete game of his own, while Clint Capela continued to do a good job in the middle, finishing with 17 points and 10 rebounds. This was the first of a five-game road trip for the Rockets, who take-on the Trail Blazers on Sunday.

DeMarcus Cousins was the high-point man for Sacramento, with 32 points on 12-of-22 shooting, including 5-of-9 from long range. Cousins poured in four three-pointers in the final quarter as part of a comeback rally by the Kings, but it was not enough. The Kings stayed with their smaller lineup, keeping Cousins at center and Rudy Gay at power forward. However, Gay struggled in this one, going 4-of-12 from the field on his way to 10 points. This was the final game of a five-game home stand for the Kings, which they finished 2-3. They now head out on a six-game road trip beginning in Brooklyn on Sunday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Philadelphia 76ers,104-99, in double overtime at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday.

A back-and-forth affair that nevertheless saw limited offense from both clubs went into the first extra period after the Sixers' Robert Covington missed the second of two free throws with 11 seconds remaining, which left the game knotted at 86. Marc Gasol then missed a potential game-winning 25-foot three-point jumper with four seconds remaining in regulation. The two teams experienced a scoreless drought of over two minutes midway through the first overtime after a Mike Conley trey gave the Grizzlies (10-5) an 89-86 lead.  However, Jerryd Bayless scored the last five points of the fifth quarter, sending the contest into the second overtime in a 91-91 tie. Memphis was finally able to pull away for good with contributions from Zach Randolph, Gasol and Conley over the final five minutes, sealing their 10th victory of the season. 

Gasol paced the visitors with 27 points, four rebounds, four assists, three blocks and three steals. Mike Conley posted a near triple-double with 25 points, nine rebounds, nine assists and two steals. The two stars combined for exactly half of the team's total and each played a whopping 45 minutes. JaMychal Green managed a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a block. Randolph led the reserves with 11 points, six rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. 

The Sixers (4-11) were led by Ersan Ilyasova, who supplied a 22-point, 12-rebound double-double before fouling out after 40 minutes. Covington was next with a 19-point, 10-rebound double-double that included two assists, three steals and three blocks. Joel Embiid made it three-for-three in the double-double department for the first unit, registering 12 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, three blocks and a steal. Bayless paced the second unit with 18 points, six rebounds and six assists, while Nik Stauskas logged a robust 40 minutes off the bench and contributed 10 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 119-114, at Spectrum Center on Wednesday. 

The Spurs (12-3) have long been renowned for their defense, and rightfully so. However the Hornets (8-6) were able to pierce San Antonio's armor Wednesday, touching up Gregg Popovich's crew for a season-high 114 points. Charlotte had eight players hit double digits in the scoring column and tallied 50.6 and 55.0 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively. Their second unit compiled 45 points overall, but the Spurs countered with standout efforts from Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge, which were pivotal in keeping the Spurs' road record unblemished at 8-0. 

Leonard collected 30 points, five rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block to lead the visitors. Aldridge followed with 23 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. Danny Green was solid with his best effort since returning seven games ago, posting a season-best 16 points and adding three rebounds, two assists and a block. Tony Parker totaled a modest 11 points, three assists, a rebound and a steal, and hit a clutch 23-foot three-pointer with 22 seconds remaining to extend San Antonio's advantage to 115-110. Davis Bertans paced the bench with 11 points.

Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 26 points and supplemented them with nine rebounds and seven assists. Nicolas Batum was next with 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Roy Hibbert, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams posted a trio of 10-point efforts and also combined for 10 rebounds. Frank Kaminsky III led the second unit with 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists, while Marco Belinelli and Spencer Hawes supplied 12 and 11 points, respectively, off the bench as well. 

The Spurs head to Boston to tangle with the Celtics on Friday afternoon, while the Hornets go up north for a Friday evening tussle with the New York Knicks.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the host Orlando Magic, 92-87, at Amway Center on Wednesday. 

Orlando had the second-worst offense in the league, while the Suns had the worst defense, so something had to give in this matchup. It was the Magic's offense that proved to be more inept, as they were held to just 36 percent shooting on their way to 87 points. They also struggled from three-point range and from the free-throw line, going 7-of-25 from deep and 14-of-23 from the charity stripe. Both teams made just 33 shots, but the Magic took 18 more shots than the Suns, as they were far from efficient in their loss. 

Phoenix (5-11) have really struggled on the defensive end this season, but this was their best defensive performance of the year. All five starters scored in double figures for the Suns, with Alex Len leading the team with 17 points. Len also provided 12 rebounds and two blocks in the absence of Tyson Chandler.  Eric Bledsoe accumulated 16 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Devin Booker and Brandon Knight combined for just 23 points, three rebounds and four assists, but played strong defense. P.J. Tucker was a nice spark off the bench, providing 10 points and seven rebounds. On deck for Phoenix is a home matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.

Orlando (6-9) has struggled on offense all season and not being able to score against the Suns may be the low point. Evan Fournier carried the load in this defeat, as he tallied 25 points, four rebounds and three steals in the loss. Nikola Vucevic recorded a 21-point, 13-rebound double-double on 10-of-15 shooting. No other starter scored in double figures with Elfrid Payton accruing nine points, six rebounds and seven assists as the starting point guard. Orlando's next game will be on Friday, when they host the Washington Wizards.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 137-125, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday.

Kevin Love has looked much more comfortable with the Cavs this season and it really showed in this dominating win. Love set an NBA-record with 34 first-quarter points, going 8-of-11 from three-point range. He finished the game with just 40 points, but that was still a career-best with Cleveland. The Cavaliers offense was clicking on all cylinders, as they shot 53 percent (48-of-90) from the field and 58 percent from three-point range (21-of-36). Portland's offense wasn't far behind, as they went 47-of-90 from the field to shoot 52 percent/. Cleveland's 81-point first half fell just shy of a franchise-records for both teams. 

Portland (8-9) have really struggled on defense this season and this loss may have been the most embarrassing one thus far. Damian Lillard did all he could on offense though, as he tallied 40 points, seven rebounds and 11 assists on 13-of-21 shooting in the defeat. C.J. McCollum struggled, going just 5-of-12 from the field en route to 13 points, one rebound and two assists. Mason Plumlee went 9-of-10 from the field to score 19 points, but grabbed just four rebounds in 23 minutes of action.  Evan Turner was the only bench player to score more than seven points, as he dropped 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Portland will look to get out of this slump on Friday against the surging New Orleans Pelicans for their next game. 

Cleveland (11-2) have not let up one bit after their championship campaign from last year and offensive showcases like this show why they're so good. Kevin Love was the star, as he scored an NBA-record 34 points in the first quarter and finished the game with 40 points. LeBron James may have been the player of the game though, as he accumulated 31 points, 10 rebounds, 13 assists and three steals in the win. Kyrie Irving finished with 20 points and six assists of his own. Channing Frye went 4-for-6 from three-point range en route to a bench-leading 14 points. The Cavaliers will return to action on Friday in a home matchup against the struggling Dallas Mavericks.

												The Atlanta Hawks went on the road and defeated the Indiana Pacers 96-85 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday.

The Hawks (10-5) were at risk of losing their fourth straight game heading into Wednesday, but Dwight Howard was not going to let that happen. The big man put on a Superman-like performance, notching 23 points and 20 rebounds in 33 minutes. It was his 11th double-double of the season and his first 20-point, 20-rebound game. His partner in the frontcourt, Paul Millsap, had a double-double of his own Wednesday night, posting 18 points and 11 rebounds -- his fifth double-double of the season. In the end, the game was won on the boards for Atlanta, as they out-rebounded the Pacers (7-9) by 19, 56-37. 

For Indiana, both Paul George and Myles Turner returned to the lineup after missing time with ankle injuries, but even that wasn't enough to get past the Hawks. George put together a solid performance, recording 18 points and six rebounds, but shot a poor 6-of-22 from the field and 2-of-11 from behind the arc. Turner couldn't get anything going on the offensive end, posting just seven points on top of nine rebounds in his return. It was Thaddeus Young who ended up leading the way for the Pacers, posting a game-high 24 points on 10-of-13 shooting and seven rebounds in 41 minutes.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 111-92, at Barclays Center on Wednesday.

The Celtics (9-6) received a pair of strong efforts from their dynamic backcourt duo of Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley to comfortably ride to their third straight win, and fifth road victory overall. The guard combo combined for 45 points on 43 shot attempts between them, a tally that included a 5-of-9 effort for Thomas from long range. Six Boston players managed double-digit scoring overall, while the defense held the Nets (4-10) to sub-40 percent success rates from both the field and three-point range. 

Thomas added five assists, a rebound and a block to his team-high 23 points. Bradley was right behind with 22 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a game-high five steals. Al Horford registered 17 points, eight assists, five rebounds, two blocks and a steal. Jae Crowder continued to round back into form with 15 points, five rebounds and an assist. Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko co-led the reserves with a pair of 10-point efforts.

Sean Kilpatrick actually led the Nets off the bench, totaling 23 points, three assists, two rebounds and three blocks over 32 minutes. Trevor Booker was next and led the first unit with an 18-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included three assists and four steals. Bojan Bogdanovic supplied 14 points, eight boards and two dimes. Brook Lopez had a quiet game by his standards, tallying 13 points, three boards, two assists, two steals and a block. Joe Harris was productive off the bench as well, with 12 points and a trio of boards. 

The Celtics return home to face off with the San Antonio Spurs on Friday afternoon, while the Nets travel to Indiana to tangle with the Pacers on Friday evening.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Miami Heat, 107-84, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday. 

Detroit has been dominant at home this season and it's the defense that has really carried them. They are allowing under 88 points a game at home this season and this result actually lowered that league-leading average. That was key again here, as they held Miami to 36 percent shooting from the field and 27 percent from three-point range. The Pistons also dominated the rebounding, winning that battle 49-37. The Detroit starters outscored the Heat starters 70-32. 

Miami (4-10) has had to play some tough competition lately and it's no easy task to play in Detroit right now. All the starters struggled, as they combined for just 32 points, with only one player scoring in double figures. Tyler Johnson led the team in scoring, as he dropped 15 points and seven assists off the bench. James Johnson was second on the team, as he tallied 15 points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks off the pine. Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside and Dion Waiters. combined to go 7-of-25, with no player reaching double figures in any stat aside from minutes. Miami's next game will be on Friday, when they travel to play the Memphis Grizzlies. 

Detroit (7-9) has really struggled recently, but a home game against the Heat is just what the doctor ordered. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the team in scoring, tallying 22 points and five rebounds on 7-of-13 shooting. Andre Drummond recorded a double-double, accruing 18 points, 15 rebounds, four steals and four blocks in the win. Tobias Harris provided 17 points, six rebounds and three assists of his own. Detroit's next game will be a tough one, as they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Houston Rockets 115-102 at Toyota Center on Wednesday. 

It was a wire-to-wire victory for the Raptors (9-6), who ended their two-game slide Wednesday night on the road. While he didn't reach his scoring average on the season, DeMar DeRozan still led the way with 24 points, nine assists and five rebounds in 36 minutes, with DeMarre Carroll managing to score 20 points of his own on 9-of-14 shooting. Jonas Valanciunas added a double-double of 15 points and 16 rebounds in what was a great night for the Toronto starting lineup, who scored 78 of the team's 115 points. As a team, the Raptors shot a scorching 12-of-23 (52 percent) from behind the arc.

For the Rockets (9-6), it was James Harden, as usual, leading the way with 29 points, 15 assists and six rebounds in 41 minutes. He was, however, a bit careless with the basketball, managing 12 turnovers and nearly matching the Raptors' team total of 14. As a team, the Rockets had an astonishing 26 turnovers, which led to plenty of empty possessions that ultimately left them with little chance to win Wednesday's contest. On the bright side, each of the five Houston starters scored in double figures, but Ryan Andersen had the next highest total behind Harden with just 13 points.

Up next, the Raptors will head to Milwaukee on Friday to take on the Bucks, while the Rockets will travel Friday to Sacramento and play the Kings.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Dallas Mavericks 124-104 at American Airlines Center on Wednesday. 

After falling behind early to the Mavericks (2-11), the Clippers (13-2) quickly kicked it into high gear as they maintained their best record in the NBA. Following a dominate second-quarter performance, Los Angeles, and their 23-point lead heading into halftime, proved to be too much for Dallas. The Clippers starters all played 26 minutes or less after resting in the fourth quarter, so it was Austin Rivers off the bench who led the team in scoring, as he posted an efficient 22 points in 26 minutes. Chris Paul led the starters with 18 points and four assists, while DeAndre Jordan wasn't far behind, recording 16 points and a team-high eight rebounds. 

For the Mavericks, it was the return of star power forward Dirk Nowitzki to the starting lineup after the German missed the last eight games due to an Achilles tendon injury. Prior to the game, head coach Rick Carlisle said Nowitzki would be on a strict minutes restriction, but he still managed to play 20 minutes, scoring 10 points and grabbing six rebounds in that time. Harrison Barnes led the way for the Mavericks as he returned to his regular spot as the team's starting small forward, scoring 22 points on 10-of-19 shooting in 30 minutes. Dallas, however, lost their seventh straight game as they continue to slide in this young season.

Up next, the Clippers will look to stay hot on the road when they take on the Pistons on Friday, while the Mavericks will look to end their losing streak against the Cavaliers in Cleveland.

												The Utah Jazz defeated Denver Nuggets, 108-83, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Wednesday.

Utah pulled out the rare wire-to-wire win, as this game was decided well before the final whistle. The first and third quarters is where they really made their mark, as they outscored the Nuggets 67-41 in that 24-minute span. Defense was key for Utah, as they held Denver to 31 percent from the field. Utah was very efficient on their end, as they shot 50 percent from the field and assisted on 19 of their 39 made baskets. The Jazz dominated in the paint, outscoring the Nuggets 52-30 in the key.  

Denver (6-9) had to play this game without Danilo Gallinari and they simply didn't have enough offense in his absence. Jamal Murray carried the load, as he followed up his career-high 24 points on Tuesday with a 23-point night here, off the bench. Wilson Chandler also played well off the pine, totaling 13 points and nine rebounds. The starters were atrocious, as Will Barton, Emmanuel Mudiay and Jusuf Nurkic combined for six points on 2-of-22 shooting. Kenneth Faried finished with eight points and 10 rebounds. On deck for the Nuggets is a home matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.

												The host New Orleans Pelicans blew out the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 117-96, at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday. 

New Orleans (6-10) has now won five of its last six contests, turning things around completely after starting the season with eight straight losses.  The win comes on the second half of a back-to-back after the Pelicans blew out the Atlanta Hawks, largely without star big man Anthony Davis on the floor.  Davis was back in full force on Wednesday, however, contributing 45 points and 10 rebounds while holding opposing big man Karl-Anthony Towns to just nine points. Davis is now one of only two players in the NBA averaging over 30 points per game, and he edged closer to league leader Russell Westbrook with Tuesday's scoring outburst.   The return of former All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday has also energized the Pelicans on their win streak.  Holiday scored only seven points in Tuesday's win, but led the offense effectively, dishing out eight assists.  

Minnesota (4-10), meanwhile, has now lost three contests in a row.  After receiving offseason hype, the Timberwolves have turned out a fairly slow start to the 2016-17 campaign.  Although the team has struggled, youngsters Zach LaVine, Andrew Wiggins, and Towns have shown signs of progress.  LaVine demonstrated that progress by leading the Wolves with 26 points in New Orleans.  Wiggins and Towns, meanwhile, had off nights, posting 13 and nine respectively.  

The Pelicans will play in Portland on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Oracle Arena on Saturday to face the surging Golden State Warriors.

												The host Golden State Warriors blew out the visiting Los Angeles Lakers, 149-106, on Wednesday night. 

Golden State (13-2) posted the highest scoring total of any team this season, recording 149 points.  The Warriors were simply firing on all cylinders, shooting 61.6 percent from the field and hitting 19 three-pointers.  Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson combined for 85 points and 13 three-pointers on the night.  Golden State ran away with the game early on, scoring 41 points in the first quarter and 39 in the second, jumping out to an 80-49 lead by halftime.  Bench guard Ian Clark scored an additional 21 points for the Warriors, including five three-pointers.  Golden State managed to hold just about every significant edge, including rebounding (48-37) and turnovers (10-11).  Perhaps most impressive of all, however, were the Warriors 47 assists on the night.  

Los Angeles (8-8), meanwhile, struggled from the field.  Their issues were exacerbated by the absence of sophomore star D'Angelo Russell (knee).  The Lakers hit just 43 percent of shots and made only eight three-pointers.  The team saw significantly less ball movement than their opponents as well, recording just 22 assists.  The blowout loss comes on the tail of an exciting near-buzzer beater against OKC on Tuesday.

The two teams will rematch on Friday, this time in Los Angeles.

												The host Sacramento Kings defeated the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, 116-101.

All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins paved the way for Sacramento (6-9) to earn the easy win, scoring 36 points and pulling down 13 rebounds.  Cousins' rebounding effort helped the team establish a 46-38 rebounding advantage against the normally tough Thunder.  Kings guard Darren Collison added 21 points, but turned the ball over four times while dishing six assists.  Cousins, Collison, and forward Rudy Gay each added three three-pointers, contributing to the 12 made by the team on the night.  Sacramento reached a .500 record at home with the win.

For the Thunder (8-8), things are continuing to get worse after the team started a surprising 5-1 to open the season.  Point guard Russell Westbrook, however, has not seemed to slow down.  The NBA's leading scorer scored another 31 points on Wednesday, to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists.  Westbrook's numbers thus far have indicated that he may have a chance at being the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.  The Thunder continued to struggle from deep in Tuesday's contest, shooting just 28 percent from beyond the arc.  The team hit just seven triples in the contest.  

The thunder will travel to Denver on Friday, while the Kings will host the Houston Rockets.

												The New York Knicks defeated the visiting Portland Trail Blazers, 107-103, at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday.

The Knicks (7-7) continued their solid efforts at home with the hard-fought victory, which came on the strength of Kristaps Porzingis' 31 points, nine rebounds, an assist and a block. The second-year big man's contributions were particularly valuable on a night where Carmelo Anthony was held to 7-of-22 shooting and 17 points overall by Maurice Harkless. Despite his relatively modest scoring output, the rest of the team, particularly the second unit, managed to pick up the slack, and New York shot 46.9 percent from the field overall.

The Trail Blazers (8-8) were led by Damian Lillard's 22 points, which he supplemented with six assists, five rebounds and two steals. Backcourt mate C.J. McCollum followed with a full stat line of 16 points, five rebounds and five assists. Harkless complemented his strong defensive work against Anthony by contributing 15 points, eight boards, a steal and a block. Ed Davis turned in a solid start at power forward, posting a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included a pair of blocks. Evan Turner paced the reserves with 11 points.

Derrick Rose was a distant second behind Porzingis with 18 points, five assists, four rebounds, two steals and a block, and made a key jumper with seven seconds left to give the Knicks their final four-point margin of victory. Anthony supplemented his scoring total with six rebounds, a steal and a block. The remaining members of the starting five, Kyle O'Quinn and Courtney Lee, combined for a modest nine points and nine rebounds, but the bench was able to contribute 32 points overall. Mindaugus Kuzminskas paced the second unit's night with 10 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

The Trail Blazers hit the road again Wednesday to take on the Cleveland Cavaliers, while the Knicks remain home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Friday evening.

												The visiting New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 112-94, at Philips Arena on Tuesday. 

It didn't take long for this game to get out of hand, as the Pelicans (5-10) opened on a 26-10 run and ultimately pushed their lead to 20 points by the end of the first quarter, a lead they held onto for the rest of the evening. Tim Frazier helped them hold onto that lead, as the starting point guard finished with 21 points on 7-of-12 shooting and 14 assists in 35 minutes. Frazier's performance was necessary too, as Anthony Davis left in the second quarter with a right knee injury after diving into the crowd for a loose ball. Luckily for the Pelicans, the All-Star power forward did return later in the game, ultimately finishing with 13 points and three rebounds in 19 minutes as New Orleans won their third straight game. 

As for the Hawks (9-5), they have now dropped their third game in a row in ugly fashion. The starting backcourt of Dennis Schroeder and Kyle Korver led the way in scoring with 14 points each, while the frontcourt pairing of Paul Millsap and Dwight Howard, who have led the team in scoring so far this season, managed to score just a combined 18 points. The final starter, Kent Bazemore, shot 0-of-6 from the field and finished with just one point, one assist and one rebound in 18 minutes. In the end, it was a night to forget for the Hawks, who continue to slide after a hot start to the season.

Up next, the Pelicans will look to earn their fourth win in a row against the Timberwolves on Wednesday, while the Hawks will travel to Indiana on Wednesday to take on the Pacers.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the visiting Chicago Bulls, 110-107, at Pepsi Center on Tuesday. 

While there were some huge swings in the first half, this game stayed close throughout the second half. The Bulls started the game up 31-19 after the first quarter, but the Nuggets responded with a 22-0 run in the second quarter to recapture the lead. From there, it was even throughout, as there were 13 ties in total with no team leading by more than six points for the final 14 minutes. Bench scoring was the biggest difference in this game, with the Nuggets bench combining for 61 points to the Bulls 13 combined bench points.  Denver won many of the stats, as they won the rebounding battle, assist differential, points in the paint and fastbreak points.  

Chicago (9-6) is in the midst of the circus road trip and this tight loss made them 3-2 through five games. Jimmy Butler did all he could, as he tallied 35 points, eight rebounds and five assists in the defeat. Dwyane Wade was second on the team, as he scored 22 points on 9-of-21 shooting. Rajon Rondo accumulated 13 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists of his own. All five starters scored in double figures, with Taj Gibson and Robin Lopez each scoring 12 points a piece. On deck for the Bulls is a road matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday. 

Denver (6-8) has struggled in close games all season, but they were able to prevail here. Rookie Jamal Murray was the player of the game, as he scored a career-high 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting off the pine. Wilson Chandler was second on the team, as he provided 16 points and nine rebounds off the bench as well. Jusuf Nurkic recorded a double-double in the win, totaling 14 points, 14 rebounds and four assists. Danilo Gallinari led the starters in scoring with 15 points on 6-of-9 shooting. Denver will be in action again on Wednesday, as they travel to play the Utah Jazz for their next game.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, 111-109, at Staples Center.

Los Angeles (8-7) got off to a hot start, establishing a 13-point lead by the end of the first quarter.  Despite sophomore star D'Angelo Russell's absence due to a knee injury, the Lakers saw high output from the point guard position.  Veteran Jose Calderon slid into the starting role, playing 23 minutes and shooting 4-of-5 from the field for 12 points.  Meanwhile, bench guard Jordan Clarkson scored 18 points while snagging four steals on the defensive end.  The Lakers were given a run for their money as the game ended, however, with the Thunder able to regain the lead with under 20 seconds to play.  Luckily for Los Angeles, veteran wing Nick Young was able to drain a clutch three-point shot with five seconds remaining to win the game.  The three-pointer was Young's fourth of the night and gave him 17 points.

The Thunder (8-7) have now lost six of their last eight contests after a hot 6-1 start to the season.  Tuesday's last-second loss was handed to OKC after coming back from double-digit deficits at multiple points during the game.  Leading the comeback efforts was All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook, who put on a stunning offensive show in the fourth quarter.  The guard had 15 points, including four three-pointers, in the quarter.  Westbrook finished just shy of a triple-double, posting 34 points, 13 assists, and eight rebounds.  Westbrook has become no stranger to such stat lines, as he entered the game averaging 31.6 points, 10.4 assists, and 9.6 rebounds per game.  Big man Steven Adams complemented Westbrook by delivering one of his best performances of the season, scoring 20 points on 9-of-13 shooting.

The Lakers will host the Warriors on Friday, while the Thunder will visit the Nuggets in Denver.

												The Philadelphia Sixers defeated the visiting Miami Heat, 101-94, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday.

After only having totaled 10 wins last season, an improving Philadelphia squad has now already won four games, all at home, in the current campaign, following an impressive performance against the reeling Heat (4-9). Joel Embiid continued his excellent stretch of early-season play, leading the way for the Sixers (4-10) with 22 points, five rebounds, three blocks and a steal. The big man got the line a team-high nine times, converting seven of those opportunities into points. Philadelphia collectively shot very well overall, posting respective success rates of 47.4 and 42.3 percent from the field and three-point range. In turn, they clamped down defensively on Miami, holding them to 38.6 and 22.6 percent figures in those categories.

Hassan Whiteside posted a 32-point, 13-rebound double-double that paced the Heat, and he also added a pair of blocks. Dion Waiters tallied 19 points, five assists, three rebounds and a block. Goran Dragic was next with 10 points, seven assists, four rebounds, three steals and a block but had a rough night from the field, going just 4-of-13 from the field and 0-of-4 from three-point range. 

Gerald Henderson was second on the Sixers behind Embiid with a season-high 19 points on 6-of-8 shooting, including a 3-of-3 mark from long distance. Ersan Ilyasova contributed a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double, along with three assists and a steal. Robert Covington filled out the stat sheet with nine points, nine rebounds, three steals and an assist. Jahlil Okafor led the bench with 15 points, three rebounds and an assist. 

The Heat next travel to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Wednesday night, while the Sixers remain home and go for their fifth victory when they take on the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns, 106-101, at Verizon Center on Monday. 

While these are two teams that have struggled all season long, these two talented backcourts put on a display in this matchup. John Wall and Bradley Beal combined for 60 points, eight rebounds and 15 assists, while the Suns' backcourt of Devin Booker and Eric Bledsoe combined for 59 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists of their own. Washington took care of business when it mattered most, as they outscored Phoenix 31-21 in the fourth quarter. The biggest difference in the game were the turnovers, as the Wizards forced 21 from the Suns, while committing just 11 on their end. The fastbreak points were decisive as well, with Washington winning that battle 25-6. There were 13 ties and 20 lead changes in a game that came down to the final seconds. 

Phoenix (4-11) put in a strong effort in this loss, but couldn't hold off a hungry Wizards bunch. Devin Booker led the team in scoring, as he dropped 30 points on 12-of-26 shooting. Eric Bledsoe stuffed the stat sheet, accruing 29 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Alex Len started for Tyson Chandler once again, amassing 11 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double-double. No other player on the team had more than seven points aside from Bledsoe, Len and Booker. On deck for the Suns is a road matchup against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. 

Washington (4-9) had been very disappointing this season, but a comeback win here may be the boost they need going forward. Bradley Beal dropped a career-high in the win, as he scored 42 points on 14-of-22 shooting. John Wall went just 6-of-24 from the field, but did everything else, accumulating 18 points, four rebounds, 15 assists, four steals and three blocks. Marcin Gortat was the only other Wizard in double figures, as he totaled 10 points and 13 rebounds. Otto Porter provided nine points and nine rebounds of his own. The Wizards will be off until Friday, when they travel to play the Orlando Magic.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Charlotte Hornets 105-90 at Spectrum Center on Monday. 

The Grizzlies (9-5) pulled out their fifth straight win behind a strong effort from Mike Conley. The floor general for the Grizzlies was an all around force from end-to-end, especially after losing James Ennis (calf). The calf injury flared up after returning to the lineup on Monday, and is another blow to the front court for Memphis given Chandler Parsons (bruised left knee) inability to play for roughly two more weeks. 

Memphis controlled the pace of the game from start to finish and never let the Hornets (8-5) get close enough to make it a game. The game got blow fully open after Conley buried a 27-foot three point shot to take a 69-45 lead with just a few seconds left in the third quarter. The Grizzlies point guard finished with 31 points, four rebounds, two assists and three steals on 11-of-21 shooting. JaMychal Green had a great performance in the starting lineup with 12 points, eight rebounds and an assist on 4-of-4 shooting in 31 minutes. 

Kemba Walker led the starting lineup in scoring for the Hornets, but failed to provide enough to get his team back in the game after contributing 17 points and two assists. Charlotte got strong productivity from the bench, where Frank Kaminsky dropped 23 points on 11 shots in 20 minutes, while Spencer Hawes added 14 points and 10 rebounds. 

Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Hornets host the San Antonio Spurs, while the Grizzlies head to Philadelphia to take on the 76ers.

												The visiting Golden State Warriors defeated the Indiana Pacers, 120-83, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday. 

It was a fairly effortless victory for the Warriors (12-2), as the Pacers (7-8) entered without Paul George (ankle) and Myles Turner (ankle). From the start, Golden State was dominant, opening up a 13-point lead by the end of the the first quarter and never looking back by winning every single period. Klay Thompson put together a incredibly efficient performance, scoring 25 points on 10-of-18 shooting from the field in just 26 minutes. Steph Curry wasn't too far behind, scoring 22 points in 30 minutes, while Kevin Durant stuffed the stat sheet, posting 14 points, 11 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. As a team, it wasn't a prolific shooting night from the Warriors but it was enough to get the job done, as they shot 44.4 percent from the field and 36 percent from behind the arc.

For the Pacers, it was a night to forget, with only three players managing to score in double figures. Rodney Stuckey, who looks to finally be back at full health, led the way scoring 21 points on 7-of-12 shooting in 24 minutes off the bench, while Thaddeus Young and Jeff Teague were the only other Indiana players to reach double figures, scoring 14 and 11 points respectively. However, the injury bug hit the Pacers once again when they needed it the least, as Jeff Teague left the game with a sprained ankle and did not return, but head coach Nate McMillan did say after the game that Teague could have returned if it was a competitive outing. 

Up next, the Warriors will head home Wednesday to avenge their loss early in the season to the Lakers, while the Pacers will look to get healthy in time for when they take on the Hawks on the same day.

												The visiting Houston Rockets defeated the Detroit Pistons, 99-96, at Palace at Auburn Hills on Monday. 

The Rockets (8-5) shook off a 25-18 deficit after one quarter to outscore the Pistons by an 81-71 margin the rest of the way. However, overtime was a possibility until the final buzzer, when Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's 50-foot three-point attempt failed to find the net and sent the Pistons (6-8) to their second home defeat in as many games. James Harden and Clint Capela led the way for Houston with respective double-doubles, and the Rockets posted a 44.9 percent tally from the field overall.

Harden paced the visitors with 28 points, 11 assists, eight rebounds and a block. Capela contributed a 15-point, 12-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two blocks. Trevor Ariza was next with a solid line of 14 points, six rebounds, three assists and a steal. Ryan Anderson collected 10 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Sam Dekker led the second unit with 12 points, four rebounds and an assist. 

Caldwell-Pope led the way for the Pistons with 26 points, two assists, a rebound and two steals. Andre Drummond and Marcus Morris followed with a pair of 13-point efforts, with the former also hauling in 16 boards, an assist and four steals, while the latter totaled two rebounds and a block. Ish Smith produced a full stat sheet of 10 points, eight assists, four rebounds and a block. Jon Leuer paced the second unit with 12 points, eight rebounds and a block.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the visiting Orlando Magic, 93-89, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Monday.

There were some major swings between these two teams and that's a microcosms of their seasons thus far. Orlando actually got out to a 16-2 lead to start the game, before Milwaukee were able to recapture the lead just before the half, thanks to a 29-17 second quarter. The Magic then responded with a 30-20 third quarter of their own. The Bucks then started the fourth quarter with a 16-2 run and won the fourth quarter 24-15 on their way to a victory. Orlando really killed themselves with turnovers, as they committed 18 in the first half and set a season-high with 25 in total. Milwaukee also dominated through transition baskets, as they won the fastbreak differential 27-12.

Orlando (6-8) has been struggling on offense all season long and a season-high in turnovers is not the way to get over that problem. Serge Ibaka led the team in scoring, totaling 21 points, eight rebounds, two steals and three blocks in the loss. Evan Fournier was second on the team, scoring 18 points, despite committing five turnovers. Nikola Vucevic went just 4-of-12 from the field, but finished with eight points and 11 rebounds. Elfrid Payton flirted with a triple-double, accumulating eight points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Bismack Biyombo recorded a double-double off the bench, scoring 13 points and grabbing 10 rebounds on 6-of-8 shooting. On deck for the Magic is a home matchup against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday. 

Milwaukee (6-7) had lost five of six headed into this game, so a resilient win like this is just what the doctor ordered. Giannis Antetokounmpo continued his MVP form, tallying 21 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, five steals and three blocks en route to a triple-double. Jabari Parker scored 20 of his own, hitting a career-high five three-pointers. The only other player in double figures was Michael Beasley, who scored 14 points off the bench. Milwaukee will be of until Friday, when they host the Toronto Raptors for their next game.

												The visiting Boston Celtics defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 99-93, at at Target Center on Monday. 

Enter the final period, the game was firmly in the Timberwolves' (4-9) grasp, as they held a commanding 13-point lead over the Celtics (8-6) entering the final period after winning both the second and third quarters. Boston, however, quickly changed that when they opened up the fourth quarter on a 17-0 run to take a four point lead. From there, the Timberwolves would never lead again as the Celtics' Isaiah Thomas closed things out for his team by scoring 10 of their final 12 points. Thomas finished the outing with a game-high 29 points, while Al Horford posted 20 points, six rebounds, five assists and three blocks in 36 minutes. 

For the Timberwolves, Karl Anthony Towns was nearly unstoppable, shooting 11-of-19 from the field and 2-of-4 from behind the arc en route to scoring a team-high 27 points and grabbing 18 rebounds. Minnesota's other star, Andrew Wiggins, struggled mightily Tuesday night, scoring 14 points in a very poor 5-of-18 shooting from the field. In the end, the Timberwolves lost the game because they weren't able to hit their outside shots, as Wiggins and shooting guard Zach LaVine combined to shoot 0-of-12 from 3-point range, while as a team, Minnesota shot 4-of-20 from behind the arc. 

Up next, the Celtics will head to Brooklyn on Wednesday to play the Nets, while the Timberwolves will travel to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on the same day.

												The host San Antonio Spurs earned their sixth straight win on Monday, defeating the visiting Dallas Mavericks, 96-91.

Big man LaMarcus Aldridge sat out Monday's contest for rest, but the Spurs were able to make up for the All-Star's absence.  Veteran big Pau Gasol posted 16 points and eight rebounds in just 28 minutes of play, while forward Kawhi Leonard had a strong performance, leading the team with 24 points.  Leonard also added nine rebounds and four assists.  The game remained close throughout, as the score was even after the third quarter.  Strong play from San Antonio's stars helped the team pull out the win in the game's final minutes.

For Dallas, long-time star Dirk Nowitzki remains sidelined with an Achilles injury.  A leg injury has also kept veteran guard Deron Williams on the bench.  With multiple key veterans out on Monday, some of Dallas's rising stars stepped up to keep the game competitive.  Guard Seth Curry earned the start and scored 23 points, a team high.  Recent acquisition Harrison Barnes continued his strong tenure with the Mavs, scoring 20 points and recording nine rebounds.  

The Spurs will visit Charlotte on Wednesday, while the Mavericks will host the Los Angeles Clippers.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers defeated the visiting Toronto Raptors on Monday, 123-115.

Los Angeles (13-2) remains the first-ranked team in the NBA following Monday's win.  The team has seen just two losses in fifteen games, coming by margins of just two and four points each.  The Clippers have dominated both ends of the floor en route to a league-best record, and Monday was no exception.  It was a big night for the Clippers' starting five, as three players scored 20 or more points and each starter scored at least 10.  The dynamic All-Star duo of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin scored 26 points each.  DeAndre Jordan, meanwhile, scored 17 and hit 9-of-14 from the free-throw line.  In the third quarter, the Raptors began to employ the common strategy of ""hacking"" the big man in hopes of missed free-throws.  Instead, Jordan hit 5-of-6 in a three-possession stretch, putting the Clippers up by as much as 17.  Despite a valiant comeback attempt, Los Angeles was able to maintain the sizeable lead.

Toronto (8-6) has now lost four of its last five outings and is falling in the Eastern Conference standings.  Boston is now tied with Toronto for the lead in the Atlantic Division.  The Raptors experienced heartbreak following a controversial overturned buzzer-beater in Sunday's outing against Sacramento.  The finish was less dramatic on Monday, as the Raptors were simply unable to overcome the lead established by the Clippers.  The NBA's leading scorer, DeMar DeRozan, scored an impressive 25 points, while teammate Kyle Lowry had 26.  The All-Star duo was unable to get the job done at Staples Center, however.

The Clippers will visit Dallas on Wednesday, while Toronto will visit Houston.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 104-94, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.

The Hawks (9-4) checked in to Sunday winners in six of their last seven, but the Knicks (5-7) were able to cool them off with a standout effort from Carmelo Anthony and strong production from the remainder of the starting five. New York came in handicapped down low, as Joakim Noah missed the game with an illness, but the duo of Kyle O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez combined for 15 points and 15 rebounds, helping to make up for his absence. The Knicks were also able to post a solid 47.7 percent success rate from the field overall while limiting the Hawks to just 40 percent shooting.

Atlanta was led by Paul Millsap's 19 points, which he complemented with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Dwight Howard turned in another monster effort with 18 points, 18 boards and two blocks. Kyle Korver equaled a season-high with 17 points, and added four rebounds, an assist and two steals. Kent Bazemore registered 12 points, five assists, three rebounds and a steal, while Tim Hardaway, Jr. paced the bench with 12 points. 

Anthony equaled a season high with 31 points and supplemented his scoring total with seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Kristaps Porzingis continued to serve as a highly effective wing man for Anthony, posting a 19-point, 11-rebound double-double. The backcourt duo of Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee turned in a pair of 14-point efforts, with the former also compiling seven assists and three rebounds and the latter providing five rebounds, five assists and a pair of steals. 

The Hawks return home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday evening, while the Knicks are home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday evening as well.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 129-109, at Barclay's Center on Sunday. 

In a battle between two of the worst defenses in the NBA, the more potent offense was able to prevail with a victory. Portland was hitting on all cylinders offensively, as they hit 58 percent of their shots in their win. One huge factor for the Blazers was their ability to rebound, as they snatched down 50 rebounds, while holding the Nets to 36 boards on their end. Portland never took their foot off the pedal, as they won each quarter and led by 23 at times in their victory. Their subpar defense wasn't shabby either, as they held the Nets to under 40 percent shooting. 

Portland (8-7) have been struggling on defense over recent weeks, but they showed some promising signs here in their win here. C.J McCollum was the player of the game, as he tallied 33 points, four rebounds and five assists on 12-of-19 shooting, Damian Lillard also played well, accumulating 18 points, four rebounds and five assists of his own. The bench was a nice spark, as Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard and Allen Crabbe all scored at least 14 points. The Trail Blazers will stay on the road for their next game, as they travel to New York to face the Knicks on Tuesday. 

This marks Brooklyn's (4-9) fourth-straight loss and a once promising season is turning into an ugly one. Brook Lopez did all he could to keep the Nets hanging around, as he scored a team-high 21 points on 8-of-14 shooting. He also provided six rebounds and four assists, as he was a perfect 7-of-7 in the first half to score 17 of his 21 points. Trevor Booker was second on the team, totaling 16 points and four rebounds on 7-of-9 shooting. The backcourt really struggled, as Isaiah Whitehead and Sean Kilpatrick combed to go just 3-of-19 from the field. Brooklyn will be off until Wednesday, when they host the Boston Celtics for their next game.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 115-111, in overtime at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday. 

Russell Westbrook did everything he could to keep the Thunder (8-6) alive while hosting the Pacers (7-7). The premier point guard was responsible for the driving layup to bring the game within one point with 0:34 left in the fourth quarter, and buried the 27-foot three pointer to tie the game at 103-103 points each to force overtime. Once again, Westbrook tallied a triple-double, en route to a remarkable season on paper, and an impressive record given the loss they suffered in the offseason. 

The Pacers were resilient in the victory, not losing focus even after the uber athletic Westbrook dominated his matchup throughout the game. Indiana was without their superstar Paul George (ankle), who will miss Monday's game against the Warriors as well. Glenn Robinson III was the difference maker in overtime after bringing in an important defensive rebound and turning it into a strong dunk on the other end to take a five point lead with 1:28 remaining in the extra period. Jeff Teague and Rodney Stuckey finished off the game from the free throw line to grab their seventh win of the season and improve to .500 on the year as a whole. 

Westbrook finished with 31 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds on 13-of-34 shooting in 40 minutes of action, while Victor Oladipo was the only other starter to finish in doubles figures scoring with 14 points. Enes Kanter drained a clutch three pointer to close out the third quarter on his way to 16 points, three assists and four rebounds across 25 minutes off the bench. 

Teague had his hands full with Westbrook on the defensive end of the floor, but made up that difference with an explosive offensive contest, as he scored 30 points, to go along with nine assists and five rebounds on 9-of-16 shooting. The frontcourt was also impressive for Indiana throughout the game, evidence by the combination of Thaddeus Young and Myles Turner, who teamed up for 35 points, 20 rebounds, three blocks and two steals. 

Next up, the Pacers face a tough second game of a back-to-back when they host the Golden State Warriors, while the Thunder visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the Toronto Raptors, 102-99, at Golden 1 Center on Sunday.

The outcome of the back-and-forth tussle was not certain even after the clock hit double zeros, as a three-pointer at the buzzer by Terrence Ross was reviewed on instant replay before being waved off for having failed to beat the clock. The last-second turn of events secured only the fifth victory of the season for the Kings (5-9), which shot over 40 percent from both the field and three-point range in a see-saw battle in which both teams alternated the advantage in each quarter. Rudy Gay led the way  for Sacramento with 23 points, nine rebounds, four assists, three blocks and a steal while shooting an outstanding 9-of-13 from the field. 

The Raptors (8-5) were led by Kyle Lowry's 25 points, which he supplemented eight rebounds, six assists and two steals. Jonas Valanciunas was right behind him with a 23-point, 14-rebound double-double that also featured two assists and two blocks. DeMarre Carroll furnished 17 points, four rebounds and two steals. That trio of strong performances helped overcome DeMar DeRozan's season-low 12 points, which came as a result of 3-of-15 shooting.

DeMarcus Cousins was second behind Gay with a 19-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included four assists. He also made a key deflection on the inbound pass to Ross in the closing seconds, delaying the process just enough to make his aforementioned three-point heave inadmissible. Darren Collison came within an assist of his own double-double, posting 15 points, nine assists and two steals. Arron Afflalo paced the reserves with 14 points, five rebounds and an assist. 

The Raptors head to Los Angeles on Monday night to take on the Clippers, while the Kings remain home to face off with the OKC Thunder on Wednesday evening.

												The host Denver Nuggets defeated the Utah Jazz, 105-91, at Pepsi Center on Sunday. 

In what's typically a rivalry game, the Nuggets got the better of a beat-up Jazz team here. Denver came out with a defensive mindset early, as they led by 10 points after a 24-14 first quarter. Utah struggled shooting, as they went 39 percent from the field and 27 percent from three-point range. The turnover differential was decisive as well, with the Nuggets committing eight turnovers to their 31 assists, while the Jazz' recorded just 15 assists to 10 turnovers. It was a near wire-to-wire win for Denver, as they led for the final 45-plus minutes. 

Utah (7-8) continues to play without George Hill and Derrick Favors, but it's clearly hurting the offense right now. Gordon Hayward had to carry the load in this game, tallying a team-high 25 points, seven rebounds and two assists in the loss. Dante Exum, Rodney Hood and Joe Johnson all scored 10 points a piece in the backcourt. The frontcourt wasn't much better, as Trey Lyles and Rudy Gobert combined for just 14 points and 13 rebounds. Utah's next game will be a rematch against the Nuggets on Wednesday. 

Denver (5-8) has gotten off to a slow start at home this season, but gave fans a show in this win. Rookie Jamal Murray had the best game of his career, dropping a team-high 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting off the bench. Wilson Chandler played well off the bench as well, as he scored 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Danilo Gallinari went just 4-of-14 from the field, but finished the game with 13 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Jusuf Nurkic recorded a double-double, totaling 16 points and 11 rebounds on 8-of-12 shooting. Will Barton played his first game in nearly a month, scoring seven points in 19 minutes as the starting shooting guard. Emmanuel Mudiay flirted with a triple-double in the victory, accumulating 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Denver's next game will be a home game against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 118-110, at Staples Center on Sunday.

Chicago continues their circus road trip and they continue to show what a true threat they are. A 9-2 run to start the fourth really put distance between these teams, as it was the Bulls first double-digit lead of the game. Rebounding was the key for Chicago, as they won that battle, 56-37. The Bulls were lights-out from the field as well, shooting 52 percent from the field and 36 percent from three-point range. They made their presence felt in the paint through scoring as well, outscoring the Lakers 60-44 in the paint. 

Chicago (9-5) have been one of the surprises of the league and road wins like this just add to their impressive run. Jimmy Butler continued his MVP campaign, as he tallied 40 points, seven rebounds and six assists on 14-of-23 shooting. Nikola Mirotic got a rare start with Dwyane Wade resting, as he recorded a double-double, in a 15-point, 15-rebound performance. Robin Lopez totaled 12 points and 11 rebounds of his own. Isaiah Canaan led the bench in scoring, dropping 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting, Rajon Rondo went just 2-of-9 from the field, but grabbed nine rebounds and dished out 12 assists in the win. On deck for the Bulls is a road matchup against the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday. 

Los Angeles (7-7) will have it's inevitable growing pains with this young core and a veteran team like the Bulls was too much to handle. The bench was spectacular yet again, as Lou Williams and Larry Nance Jr. led the team in scoring. Williams finished with 25 points on 8-of-14 shooting, while Nance Jr. totaled 18 points and six rebounds on 8-of-11 shooting. Jordan Clarkson did have a stinker off the bench though, scoring five points on 1-of-12 from the field. Nick Young led the starters with 15 points, while Julius Randle scored 14 of his own. The Lakers play again on Tuesday, as they host the Oklahoma City Thunder for their next game.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Utah Jazz, 111-102, on Saturday at Toyota Center.

Despite the return of Patrick Beverly to the starting lineup, Eric Gordon is still finding ways to contribute. The veteran guard tallied a robust 37 minutes off the bench Saturday, parlaying them into a line of 20 points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. The minutes were actually the second-highest of the season for Gordon, while his scoring total marked only his third time over the 20-point mark on the campaign. He impressively drained half of his eight three-point attempts to share the team lead with James Harden, helping the Rockets (8-5) to their fourth home win in five tries.

The Jazz (7-7) were led by a 25-point outburst from Rodney Hood, his best scoring total since the opener. He also added four rebounds and three assists. Trey Lyles drew another start in place of Derrick Favors (knee), posting 21 points and five boards. Rudy Gobert put together a 12-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included an assist, four blocks and two steals. Dante Exum was in the first unit again in George Hill's (thumb) stead, supplying 10 points, a rebound and an assist.

Harden paced the Rockets with a 31-point, 10-assist double-double, his ninth in the last 10 games. The Beard also provided three rebounds and two blocks. Clint Capela was next in line with 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists and a block, with his scoring total representing a season high. No other member of the starting five was able to tally double-digit scoring, but Nene Hilario joined Gordon in accomplishing the feat off the bench, registering 16 points, six boards and a steal. 

The Jazz continue on the road to Denver, where they'll take on the Nuggets on Sunday evening, while the Rockets head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Monday night.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 121-116, in overtime at Smoothie King Center on Saturday.

As usual, Anthony Davis spearheaded the victory for the Pelicans (4-10), but Jrue Holiday and Langston Galloway both provided key offensive support off the bench. Davis scored eight of the Pelicans' 13 points in overtime, while the latter two combined for 45 points on 16-of-31 shooting. The standout performances, along with some strong late-game defensive play, helped New Orleans overcome the 85-74 deficit they entered the fourth quarter with, leading to their third home victory of the season. 

The Hornets (8-4) were unsurprisingly led by Kemba Walker, who totaled a team-high 25 points and added seven rebounds, five assists and a steal. Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams posted a pair of 13-point efforts, with the former also supplying seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks, and the latter bringing in a pair of rebounds. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist turned in a 10-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included a pair of assists, two blocks and a steal. Marco Belinelli led the bench with a season-high 22 points, along with 10 rebounds and five assists. His scoring haul included an outstanding 7-of-9 tally from beyond the arc. Frank Kaminsky III also was highly productive off the bench, managing 15 points, five rebounds, two assists and a steal. 

Davis added 16 rebounds, two assists and three blocks to his game-high scoring total. Tim Frazier managed 17 points, eight assists, five rebounds and a steal. Galloway led the reserves with 23 points and added seven rebounds and three steals, while Holiday was once again stellar in only his second game of the season, posting 22 points and nine assists. 

The Hornets head back home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday, while the Pelicans head to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Tuesday.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Washington Wizards, 114-111, at Verizon Center on Saturday. 

An array of solid offensive performances across their roster helped the Heat (4-8) overcome a pair of standout efforts from the dynamic duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal. Miami saw all five members of the first unit post double-digit scoring, and they also saw James Johnson tally 17 points off the bench. They were able to tally 50.6 and 48.1 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, which helped them withstand a late rally from the Wizards (3-9), who outscored them by a 29-23 margin in the fourth quarter. 

The Heat was led by Goran Dragic's 22 points, which he complemented with six assists, three rebounds and a steal. Hassan Whiteside turned in another dominating effort down low, posting an 18-point, 18-rebound double-double that also included an assist and three blocks. Dion Waiters supplied 16 points, eight boards and a block. Josh Richardson registered 15 points, seven rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block, while Derrick Williams compiled 12 points and five rebounds over 17 minutes while drawing the start at power forward. 

Wall and Beal paced the Wizards with a pair of 34-point efforts, with the former adding eight assists and three rebounds and the latter also posting five rebounds, dishing out four assists and recording a steal. Wall was especially impressive from beyond the arc, draining five of his six three-point attempts. Marcin Gortat was the only other Washington player to manage double digits in the scoring column, totaling 10 points, 16 rebounds, four assists and five blocks. 

The Heat heads to Philadelphia for the next phase of their trek through the Northeast, as they take on the Sixers on Monday night. The Wizards remain home and await the Phoenix Suns for a Monday night matchup of their own.

												The host Orlando Magic defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 97-87, at Amway Center on Saturday. 

In a battle between two inept offenses, the Magic were able to prevail with a much-needed victory. They took care of business late, as the Magic outscored the Mavericks 31-18 in the fourth quarter. Defense was key for Orlando, as they held Dallas to 34 percent shooting from the field and dominated the rebounding, 50-34. The Magic not only controlled the paint through rebounding, as they outscored Dallas 32-16 in the paint as well. No team led by more than nine points, as this was tightly-contested throughout. 

Dallas (2-10) is in a historically bad stretch offensively right now and a 34 percent night just adds to those struggles. Newly-acquired, Jonathan Gibson, was the Mavericks best player, as he tallied 26 points, six rebounds and three assists off the bench. Wesley Matthews and Seth Curry led the starters in scoring, as they scored 13 apiece. Harrison Barnes went just 3-of-13 from the field, en route to an 11-point night. The offensive struggles are likely to continue, as they travel to San Antonio on Monday to face the Spurs for their next game.

Orlando (6-7) has been just as bad on offense as Dallas, but they were able to win here thanks to some elite defense. D.J. Augustin led the team in scoring, totaling 18 points and six assists off the bench. Serge Ibaka was second in scoring, tallying 15 points, nine rebounds and three blocks in the win. Nikola Vucevic amassed 12 points and 12 rebounds, despite going 5-of-16 from the field. Bismack Biyombo recorded a double-double off the bench, accruing 13 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in the win. Orlando will look to keep rolling, as they travel to Milwaukee on Monday to face the Bucks.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Detroit Pistons, 94-92, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Saturday.

Al Horford had missed the previous nine games due to some concussion issues, but he made an epic return here. In a tied ball game, Horford snatched down an offensive rebound with 1.3 seconds left and tipped in a game-winner to get Boston a much-needed win. In the next possession, he blocked a jump shot at the buzzer to seal the victory. While most statistics were even, the free-throw shooting was not. In fact, the Celtics went 16-of-17 from the charity stripe, while the Pistons went just 11-of-16. Both teams struggled from the field, with Boston shooting 40 percent and Detroit shooting 43 percent on their end. There were 19 lead changes and nine ties in a hard-fought battle. 

Boston (7-6) was missing the defensive presences of Jae Crowder and Al Horford, but both players made their returns here from a nine-game absence. Horford was the star, as he tallied 18 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and three blocks, in addition to his game-winner. Isaiah Thomas led the team in scoring, totaling 24 points, four rebounds and eight assists on 7-of-22 shooting. Avery Bradley was the only other Boston player in double figures, accumulating 13 points, four rebounds and three assists. The Celtics next game will be on Monday against the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road.

Detroit (6-8) was undefeated at home coming into this game, but they couldn't quite hold off a revived Celtics squad. Marcus Morris led the team, dropping 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Andre Drummond recorded another double-double, scoring 20 points and grabbing 17 rebounds in the loss. Ish Smith tallied 12 points, four rebounds and seven assists of his own. Detroit will remain at home for their next game, when they host the Houston Rockets on Monday.

												The host Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Phoenix Suns, 120-105, at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday. 

These are two teams at the bottom of the barrel and the Sixers wanted to capitalize on one of their best opportunities for a win. They did just that, as they came out early with a 32-19 first quarter. In addition, they led for the entirety of the game, pulling out the rare wire-to-wire win. The Sixers' offense was very efficient, as they shot 52 percent from the field and assisted on 33 of their 45 made baskets. Their defense wasn't bad either, as they held Phoenix to 42 percent from the field, 61 percent from the free-throw line and 29 percent from three-point range. Three-point shooting was especially decisive, with Philly going 17-of-35 and Phoenix going just 6-of-21. 

Phoenix (4-10) was traveling in the second half of a back-to-back set and it was clear they didn't have the legs here to compete. Eric Bledsoe did all he could though, accumulating 27 points, five rebounds and six assists in the defeat. Devin Booker was the only other starter in double figures, scoring 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting. Alan Williams recorded his second-straight double-double, scoring 12 points and grabbing 11 rebounds off the bench. Tyler Ulis had one of his best games as well, accruing nine points, four rebounds, five assists and five steals in the defeat. The Suns will stay on the road for their next game, as they face the Washington Wizards on Monday. 

Philadelphia (3-10) saw an opportunity to win here as a one-point underdog and they didn't let up. Joel Embiid played just 20 minutes, but led the team with a career-high 26 points and seven rebounds. Sergio Rodriguez flirted with a triple-double, accumulating eight points, eight rebounds and 11 assists. Nik Stauskas was a nice spark off the bench, dropping 21 points on 8-of-9 shooting. Dario Saric provided 10 points, seven rebounds and five assists of his own off the bench as well. On deck for Philadelphia is a home matchup against the Miami Heat on Monday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 93-71, on Saturday night at FedEx Forum. 

This marks the fourth win in a row for the Grizzlies (8-5), who are making a habit of shutting down opponents with silencing defense. After holding the Mavericks to only 64 points on Friday, the Grizz came out on the second night of a back-to-back set and held the young and spry Timberwolves to only 71 points. Memphis held Minnesota to 39.1 percent shooting, but also struggled themselves, hitting only 38.2 percent of their shots. However, the Grizzlies hit 33-of-38 free throws, hauled in 13 offensive boards and forced 19 turnovers to gain the edge on a poor shooting night and improve to 5-2 at home. Five players scored in double figures for Memphis, including JaMychal Green who led the way with 19 points and eight rebounds, in 28 minutes. Zach Randolph followed up with 18 points and seven rebounds, in 21 minutes off the bench. The Grizzlies head out for a two-game road trip, beginning in Charlotte on Monday. 

The Timberwolves (4-8) came into this game averaging 108.0 points per game on the season but were stopped in their tracks by a stubborn, veteran Memphis squad. The Grizzlies managed to get Karl-Anthony Towns in foul trouble as he picked up his fourth early in the third and was forced to sit most of the quarter. In addition to Towns being limited by fouls, Andrew Wiggins simply struggled from the field, shooting 2-of-11 and 0-of-3 from long range. Zach LaVine was the high-point man for the 'Wolves with 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting, in 37 minutes. Minnesota moves to 1-5 on the road this season and should be looking forward to getting back on home court, as they host the Celtics on Monday.

												The Golden State Warriors narrowly escaped Milwaukee with a 124-121 victory against the Bucks on Saturday night at BMO Harris Bradley Center. 

The Bucks jumped out of the gate with a 37-28 first quarter, perhaps catching the Warriors lagging on the second night of a back-to-back. However, the Warriors answered right back with a 41-29 second quarter to take a 69-66 lead into halftime. After trailing by 14 with 6:56 left in the fourth, the Bucks battled back to make it a two-point game with two minutes to go but could not capitalize on multiple opportunities to tie or take the lead. 

Milwaukee (5-7) had a great night offensively, shooting 51.7 percent from the field and 10-of-20 from long range, while also filling it up with 52 points in the paint. The Bucks tallied 27 assists, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who finished with six assists, along with a team-high 30 points, four rebounds, two steals and one block, in 41 minutes. Jabari Parker was the second half of Milwaukee's one-two punch, as he finished with 28 points, along with five assists, five rebounds and two steals, in 37 minutes. This was the third loss in a row for the Bucks, who go on to host the Orlando Magic on Monday. 

The Warriors (11-2) notched their second win in as many nights and seventh straight as they scored their way to victory in Milwaukee. The Warriors have found their groove and are scoring like many expected they would, averaging 122.6 points per game in their last five contests. Kevin Durant led the way in this one with 33 points on 10-of-17 shooting, along with six rebounds, five assists and two steals in 36 minutes. Klay Thompson was efficient as well with 29 points on 9-of-17 shooting, while Stephen Curry added 20 points. The Warriors dished 30 assists or more for the seventh time in a row, which is a testament to how dangerous they can be offensively, sharing the ball between multiple scorers. The Warriors look to extend their streak as they visit Indiana for a contest against the Pacers on Monday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers battled back from a 19-point deficit to grind out a huge win against the visiting Chicago Bulls, 102-95, at Staples Center on Saturday. 

The Bulls (8-5) got out to a fantastic start, with a 33-23 first quarter and were able to extend their lead to 19 mid-way though the second quarter. However, the Clippers (12-2) battled back steadily over the final three quarters, but most definitively in the fourth, where they out-scored the Bulls 30-18. 

Chicago led 77-72 after three quarters but the Clippers kept chipping away and eventually took their first lead of the game since leading 4-2, when they went up 84-82 with seven minutes to go in the game. The Clippers did not let up and held the lead for the rest of the way, ending Chicago's four-game win streak and bolstering their own record to 9-1 in their last 10 games. Blake Griffin was the high-point man for the Clippers, finishing with 26 points, along with 13 rebounds, five assists and a steal, in 39 minutes. Marreese Speights had his best game in a Clippers uniform, with 16 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter and 3-of-4 shooting from long range. The Clippers shot 40.7 percent as a team from distance and 46.8 percent overall. They now look ahead to Monday when they host the Raptors at Staples Center.

Dwyane Wade had a great game, leading the Bulls with 28 points on 9-of-20 shooting, including hitting 5-of-9 from long range. Wade also tallied eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal as he showed that he still has what it takes to compete against even the toughest of opponents. Jimmy Butler added 22 points, while Taj Gibson chipped in 11 points on 5-of-8 shooting. The Bulls face the second night of a back-to-back as they stay in Los Angeles to take on the host Lakers on Sunday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 100-96, at Spectrum Center on Friday.

The battle of Southeastern Division rivals lived up to its billing, with the Hornets (8-3) pulling away in the fourth quarter of what was an exciting nip-and-tuck contest. Nicolas Batum, Kemba Walker and Cody Zeller ripped off a trio of 20-point efforts to spearhead the win, which helped overcome a collective 41.1 percent field-goal percentage. In contrast, the Hawks (9-3) tallied a superior 46.4 percent success rate, but did turn the ball over 16 times, five more than Charlotte. Despite the defeat, Atlanta can take solace in the effort put in by the returning Dwight Howard, who hauled in 18 boards and also contributed 10 points, two assists, three steals and two blocks.

The Hawks were led by Paul Millsap, who posted a 22-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist and a block. Kent Bazemore followed with 19 points, two rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks. Dennis Schroder contributed 11 points, five assists, a rebound and a steal. Mike Muscala, who turned in a strong performance in Howard's stead on Wednesday, was productive off the bench, totaling 11 points, five rebounds, two assists and a block. 

Batum paced the Hornets with 24 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and a pair of steals. Zeller was outstanding in compiling a season-high 23 points, as he shot 9-of-10 from the field and also hauled in three boards, an assist, three blocks and two steals. Walker, who totaled 21 points, six assists, five rebounds and two steals, helped seal the victory with a go-ahead jumper with 4:03 remaining that he followed up with an acrobatic highlight-reel layup and three-point jumper shortly thereafter.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the host Indiana Pacers, 116-96, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday. 

Most home teams thrive in the first and fourth quarters due to home field advantage, but the Suns took it to the Pacers in that stretch. In fact, they outscored Indiana by 22 points in that 24-minute period and held them to just 32 points. The bench was huge for Phoenix, as they had all six bench players score at least seven points in their win. The Suns also dominated the rebounding and turnover differential, as they won the rebounding battle 46-35 and the turnover differential 18-11. 

The Suns (4-9) had just one road win coming into this game, but they let their frustrations out on an injury-riddled Indiana team here. The bench was spectacular, as they had six bench players combine for 78 points. Brandon Knight led the team in scoring off the bench, totaling 17 points and five assists. Alan Williams recorded a double-double off the pine, amassing 15 points and 15 rebounds on 6-of-7 shooting. Jared Dudley turned back the clock, as he accumulated 16 points, five rebounds and six assists in 31 minutes of action. Phoenix will look to build off this win on Saturday, when they travel to Philadelphia to face the Sixers for their next game.  

Indiana (6-7) came into this game as a huge favorite, but they simply couldn't overcome some notable injuries. Not only did Paul George miss this game with an ankle injury, C.J. Miles had to depart in the first quarter due to a knee injury. Myles Turner carried the load for the Pacers, as he tallied 22 points, six rebounds and two blocks in the loss. Jeff Teague was second on the team, as he finished with 21 points, four rebounds and seven assists. No other player scored in double figures, as Thaddeus Young and Monta Ellis finished with nine points apiece. Indiana will return to action on Sunday, when they play the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 104-81, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday.

After resting LeBron James and J.R. Smith in their last contest, the Cavs (10-2) came in to Friday's matchup with their starting five fully intact. While the Big Three of James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving turned in their typically solid offensive performances, it was a suffocating defense that keyed the comfortable victory. Cleveland held the Pistons (6-7) to a 31.2 percent success rate from the field and only one Detroit player, Jon Leuer, was able to post double-digit scoring. The Cavaliers jumped out to a 30-19 lead in the first quarter, an advantage they would never relinquish.

The Pistons' top scorers were Tobias Harris and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who each tallied a pair of nine-point efforts. Andre Drummond supplied a modest eight points, but he was able to haul in 10 rebounds and also dished out two assists and recorded a steal and a block. Marcus Morris continued his offensive slump with a seven-point output on 3-of-11 shooting, making it his third straight game with single-digit scoring. Leuer added seven rebounds to his team-high scoring effort. 

Irving paced Cleveland with 25 points, 11 assists, two rebounds and a steal. James posted 21 points, three rebounds, three assists and a block. Love put together a 12-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist. Tristan Thompson registered eight points but also brought in 14 boards, dished out two assists and recorded four blocks. Iman Shumpert led the reserves with nine points.

The Pistons head back home to await the Boston Celtics for a Saturday night showdown, while the Cavaliers will have four days off before taking on the visiting Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The host New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 113-101, at Smoothie King Center on Friday.

In a battle between two defensively inept teams, New Orleans took it to the struggling Blazers. The Pelicans offense was especially efficient, as they shot 55 percent from the field and assisted on 31 of their 45 made baskets. Their defense was better than usual too, as they held Portland to 38 percent from the field and 35 percent from three-point range. The steals and blocks were the big difference though, with New Orleans winning the steal margin 9-2 and the block differential 12-1. While there were 12 lead changes, New Orleans never relinquished the lead after the first quarter.

Portland (7-7) continues to struggle on the defensive end, as this marks the sixth time in seven games that they have allowed at least 111 points. Damian Lillard did all he could to keep the Blazers in the game though, as he scored 27 points on 8-of-24 shooting. C.J. McCollum wasn't far behind, as he totaled 24 points, four rebounds and five assists. Mason Plumlee had a nice all-around game, accumulating 13 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. Ed Davis got his first start of the season and grabbed 11 rebounds to go along with two points. Portland will look to crack this three-game losing streak when they travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Sunday for their next game. 

New Orleans (3-10) got Jrue Holiday back in this win and it's clear how much he means to this team. In his debut, he led the bench with 21 points and seven assists in 23 minutes of action. Anthony Davis carried the load though, tallying 38 points, nine rebounds, six assists and four blocks in the win. Tim Frazier got the start at point guard, scoring 12 points and dishing out eight assists. Terrence Jones was a nice spark off the bench, accruing 15 points, seven rebounds and four blocks on 6-of-10 shooting. On deck for New Orleans is a home matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 124-105, at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

The Nets (4-8) came out like a house afire to open the game, scoring a whopping 40 points in the opening quarter. However, the Thunder's dynamic backcourt duo of Russell Westbrook and Victor Oladipo took over from that point and ended up combining for 56 points overall on the night. Meanwhile, the bench put together a solid 39-point effort that featured three double-digit scoring performances. Oklahoma City (8-5) finished with a 55.1 percent success rate from the field and outscored Brooklyn by a 90-65 margin over the final three quarters. 

Brooklyn was led by Brook Lopez, who totaled 22 points, four rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. The big man was impressively 4-of-7 from three-point range. Rondae-Hollis Jefferson and Bojan Bogdanovic registered a pair of 13-point tallies, with the former adding five rebounds, two assists and two steals and the latter hauling in a trio of boards and dishing out two assists. Anthony Bennett led the second unit with 12 points and three rebounds, while Joe Harris and Sean Kilpatrick registered a pair of 10-point efforts. 

Westbrook posted a triple-double that consisted of 30 points, 13 assists, 11 rebounds and a steal. Oladipo contributed 26 points, six assists and five rebounds. Steven Adams was an effective third wheel with 15 points, six boards and a pair of blocks. Joffrey Lauvergne and Enes Kanter managed a pair of 13-point efforts to lead the reserves.

The Warriors (10-2) turned a slim seven-point lead at halftime into a robust 29-point edge by the end of the third quarter, as they outscored the Celtics (6-6) by a 31-9 margin during the period. That included a 13-point outburst over a three-and-a-half-minute stretch, helping Golden State build an advantage they wouldn't relinquish. The visitors shot 48.9 percent from the field overall despite a 7-of-20 effort from Stephen Curry, while also holding Boston to a 37.3 percent tally. 

The Warriors were led by Klay Thompson, who totaled a game-high 28 points that he supplemented with five rebounds and three assists. Kevin Durant was close behind with a 23-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included seven assists, three steals and a block. Curry provided a modest 16 points, along with seven assists, two rebounds, three steals and two blocks. He was only 2-of-10 from three-point range, his second-worst effort in that category this season. Zaza Pachulia totaled only four points, but did haul in 12 rebounds. 

Isaiah Thomas paced the Celtics with 18 points, four assists and two rebounds. Avery Bradley was next with 17 points, 10 rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block while playing a team-high 35 minutes. Marcus Smart drew the start once again at small forward, but left with an ankle contusion after 24 minutes, supplying 10 points, an assist and two steals before exiting. Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier led the reserves with a pair of 11-point efforts, with the latter also filling out the stat sheet with seven rebounds and five assists.

The Warriors head to Milwaukee for a Saturday night date with the Bucks, while the Celtics head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Saturday evening as well.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the host Dallas Mavericks, 80-64, at American Airlines Center on Friday. 

In a battle between two offensively inept teams, this scoreline looks more like a college score than an NBA one. Dallas really struggled offensively, as they shot 29 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range. The Mavericks were actually held to just 22 points between the second and third quarters, which is easily the lowest two-quarter stretch of any team this season. Memphis wasn't much better, as they shot 40 percent from the field and 36 percent from three-point range. The assist-to-turnover ratio was huge as well, with Memphis recording 16 assists and 12 turnovers, while Dallas committed 17 turnovers to just nine assists. 

Memphis (7-5) put on a defensive display for the ages here, as they slowed this game down to a crawl. While no player scored more than 12 points, they had eight players score at least six in their win. Chandler Parsons led the team in scoring, as he dropped 12 points in 23 minutes of action in what was a revenge game for the former Maverick. Marc Gasol was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 11 points, three rebounds and three assists. Zach Randolph was a nice spark off the bench, amassing 10 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Memphis will return to action on Saturday, when they host the Minnesota Timberwolves for their next game. 

Dallas (2-9) is dealing with as many injuries as anyone right now, but there's no excuse for 64 points in an NBA game. Harrison Barnes led the team in scoring, as he totaled 15 points and seven rebounds on 5-of-17 shooting. Seth Curry was the only other starter in double figures, tallying 11 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jonathan Gibson led the bench in scoring in his first game with the Mavs, dropping 11 points, four rebounds and three assists in 20 minutes of action. Dallas will look to play better on Saturday, when they travel to Orlando to face the Magic.

												The visiting Toronto Raptors defeated the Denver Nuggets in overtime, 113-111, at Pepsi Center on Friday. 

These two teams have had both of their games go down to the wire this season and the Raptors have escaped with both wins. This game was tight throughout, as there were 26 lead changes, with no team leading by more than 12 points. Three-point shooting was the Nuggets downfall, as they went 4-of-25 in the loss. The Raptors also dominated the turnover differential, as they committed 12 turnovers to the Nuggets' 19. 

Toronto (8-4) continually flies under the radar and road wins like this only add to their already impressive resume'. DeMar DeRozan once again led the team in scoring, as he tallied 30 points, five rebounds and four assists in the win. Kyle Lowry was second on the team, finishing with 18 points, five rebounds and 13 assists. Jonas Valanciunas provided 15 points and nine rebounds on 6-of-9 shooting. Terrence Ross was a nice spark off the bench, scoring 16 points on 6-of-11 shooting. Toronto will stay on the road, as they play the Sacramento Kings on Sunday for their next game.

Denver (4-8) has fallen victim to late game execution all season long and this was yet another meltdown in overtime. Emmanuel Mudiay did all he could, as he played 45 minutes, in a 25-point, six-rebound, nine-assist performance. Wilson Chandler also scored 25 points, adding 10 rebounds off the bench. Despite going just 4-of-13 from the field, Danilo Gallinari tallied 21 points and nine rebounds, thanks to a 13-of-13 night from the free-throw line. Nikola Jokic had one of his best games of the season, accumulating eight points, 12 rebounds and four assists off the bench. The Nuggets will look to play better on Sunday, when they host the Utah Jazz for their next game.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Sacramento Kings, 121-115, at Golden 1 Center on Friday night. 

The Clippers (11-2) jumped out of the gate to a 40-24 first-quarter lead, and even increased their lead to 73-54 by halftime. The Kings (4-9) rallied back late in the fourth quarter, bringing it to a two-point game, 117-115, with 2:03 to go but missed shots and turned the ball over down the stretch, which cost them their fourth loss in a row. 

DeMarcus Cousins was a beast for Sacramento, with 38 points, on 12-of-29 shooting, along with 13 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and one block, in 37 minutes. Ty Lawson filled the stat sheet with 18 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and one steal, in 36 minutes. Rudy Gay was quiet, finishing with only nine points on 3-of-11 shooting. The Kings go on to host the Raptors on Monday. 

Blake Griffin led the way offensively for the Clippers with 29 points on 7-of-15 shooting, while Chris Paul almost hit a triple-double with 11 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, along with three steals, in 33 minutes. J.J. Redick added a cool 26 points on 8-of-12 shooting, including 6-of-8 from long range. The Clippers shot 52.6 percent from the field and 44.8 percent from long range to earn their eighth win in nine games. They will be right back in action for the second of a back-to-back set as they host the Bulls at the Staples Center on Saturday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the New York Knicks, 119-112, at Verizon Center on Thursday.

The Wizards' (3-8) offense received a notable boost with the return of Bradley Beal, who'd missed three games with a hamstring injury. The talented two-guard posted 18 points, five assists and two rebounds over 29 minutes, knocking down half of his six three-point attempts in the process. The remainder of the starting five made sizable contributions as well, with three other players also hitting double digits in the scoring column. The reserves were solid as well, totaling 33 points, and the Wizards shot a stellar 54.3 percent from the field overall and 60 percent from three-point range.

The Knicks (5-7) saw Derrick Rose lead the way with a game-high 27 points, which he complemented with four assists, two rebounds and a steal. Carmelo Anthony managed 19 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal. Kristaps Porzingis supplied 16 points, seven boards, two assists and four steals. Brandon Jennings was outstanding off the bench over 24 minutes, posting a 17-point, 10-assist double-double that also included five rebounds and a steal.

John Wall paced the Wizards with a 23-point, 11-assist double-double that he rounded out with two rebounds and a steal. Otto Porter continued his recent stretch of strong play with 21 points, eight rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block. Marcin Gortat was solid down low, registering 16 points, eight rebounds, an assist and a block. Markieff Morris was the only Washington player not to tally double-digit scoring, but he did generate a full stat line of eight points, eight boards, two assists and a steal. Marcus Thornton paced the reserves with 13 points, two rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

The Knicks return home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday, while the Wizards face off with the Miami Heat at home on Saturday night.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 96-73, at American Airlines Arena on Thursday. 

The length of the Bucks (5-6) caused some issues early on for the Heat (3-8), but the Heat pushed through it and turned to their big man Hassan Whiteside on both ends of the court to finish the job at home. It was only the third win of the season for Miami, but the starters rounded out the scoring sheet, as only Derrick Williams finished below double figures. Goran Dragic (ankle) started the game after successfully going through practice and shootaround, while sophomore Justice Winslow (wrist) was ruled out. 

The neck-and-neck game was close all the way up until the fourth quarter, but the Bucks simply ran out of steam and had a handful of bad breaks, even after an all-around performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Greek Freak finished with 14 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three blocks, while Jabari Parker struggled to string together another solid contest after finishing with 11 points and eight rebounds on 5-of-20 shooting. 

Whiteside dominated the offensive and defensive ends of the floor after putting up 12 points, 17 rebounds and seven blocks, to go along with two steals on 5-of-12 shooting. Dion Waiters had the hot hand on the scoring front after contributing 23 points on 10-of-22 shooting. 

Both teams play on Saturday, as the Heat take on the Wizards in Washington, while the Bucks host the Warriors.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Portland Trail Blazers, 126-109, in a high-scoring affair on Thursday evening at Toyota Center. 

James Harden and the Rockets (7-5) certainly did not let Wednesday's loss to the Thunder, or the fact that they were playing on the second night of a back-to-back, shake them off their game. Instead, they came out guns-blazing, with a 41-point first quarter and although they slipped a little in the second, came out of halftime cooking with a 38-point third quarter. Harden notched his third triple-double of the season, with 26 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds, in 32 minutes. Meanwhile, Patrick Beverley made his season-debut for Houston, after missing time due to knee surgery. Beverley was featured in Coach Mike D'Antoni's starting lineup and finished with 11 points, three assists, three blocks and two rebounds, in 25 minutes. The Rockets will have a day off before they host the Jazz on Saturday.

The Trail Blazers (7-6) have now lost two games in a row by a combined total of 42 points. Defense has certainly been a problem for Portland as it came into this game averaging 111.3 points-against this season, the second-worst in the league. The Blazers were out-hustled in this one, giving up 17 offensive rebounds and 25 fast-break points. This was only the third time this season that Damian Lillard did not lead his team in scoring. Lillard finished with 18 points, while C.J. McCollum was the high-point man with 26. The Trail Blazers had four players score in double figures and nine players score five or more points, but once again their defense let them down. The Blazers will face the second night of a back-to-back as they visit New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Friday.

												The host Minnesota Timberwolves obliterated the Philadelphia 76ers, 110-86, at Target Center on Thursday. 

In a battle between two developing franchises, the Timberwolves showed just how much further along they are than the Sixers. Minnesota took it to Philadelphia early, as they led by 28 points at the half and held the Sixers to just 33 points in that 24-minute stretch. Defense was key all night long, as the T'Wolves held the Sixers to 37 percent from the field and 28 percent from three-point range. Minnesota also dominated down low, as they won the rebounding battle 49-40 and the points in the paint differential 56-40. 

The Sixers (2-10) continue to struggle and results like this are downright ugly. Ersan Ilyasova was a lone bright spot, as he led the starters with 13 points, three rebounds and three assists. Nik Stauskas played well off the bench, totaling 13 points, four rebounds and two steals of his own. Dario Saric led the team in scoring, as he dropped 16 points of his own off the bench. Robert Covington struggled with his shot yet again, as he scored just four points on 1-of-12 shooting. Joel Embiid played 22 minutes and amassed 10 points and 10 rebounds. On deck for the Sixers is a home matchup against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday. 

The Timberwolves (4-7) had their first primetime game in awhile and they didn't disappoint. Andrew Wiggins was especially impressive, as he scored a game-high 35 points on 14-of-20 shooting. He also added 10 rebounds and four assists in 38 minutes of action. Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a double-double in the blowout, totaling 25 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks. Gorgui Dieng also recorded a double-double, accumulating 12 points, 10 rebounds and three assists. The Timberwolves will look to build off this win when they travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Saturday for their next game.

												The visiting Chicago Bulls earned a narrow 85-77 win over the host Utah Jazz on Thursday.

In a rare weak night on the boards, Chicago (8-4) posted a two-rebound deficit to the Jazz. This seemingly made no difference, however, as the Bulls were able to lock the Jazz down on the perimeter. Chicago held Utah to just 38.5 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range. All-Star Jimmy Butler once again led the team in scoring, posting 20 points. Veteran Dwyane Wade also had a strong scoring night, posting 18 points.  Chicago was extremely careful with the ball, committing only eight turnovers on the night.

The Jazz (7-6), meanwhile, received bad news before the game, as reports broke that star forward Derrick Favors will likely miss extended time with a knee injury. Starting point guard George Hill was also forced to miss the game with a thumb injury. Favors' scoring would have been of use for Utah on Thursday, as the team struggled mightily on the offensive end. Star small forward Gordon Hayward struggled in particular, going just 3-of-15 from the field. Center Rudy Gobert led the team in scoring with 16 points on an efficient 7-of-9 shooting.

Both teams will be on the road Saturday, with the Bulls facing the Clippers and the Jazz seeing the Rockets.

												The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Washington Wizards, 109-102, at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday. 

The Sixers (2-9) made a couple of changes up front to their starting lineup, and both proved key to their second straight home win. Jahlil Okafor took his starting turn in the ongoing center rotation with Joel Embiid and led the team with 19 points, while Ersan Ilyasova, who entered the first unit in place of Dario Saric, was right behind him with a 16-point tally. Philadelphia also received 49 points from their bench, which was spearheaded by a trio of double-digit scoring efforts. In all, the home team posted a stellar 54.5 percent success rate from the field. while also holding the Wizards (2-8) to a 41.8 percent tally.

Washington was unsurprisingly led by John Wall, who managed 27 points, six assists, four rebounds and a steal. Markieff Morris followed with 19 points, four rebounds and a steal. Otto Porter managed a 15-point, 13-rebound double-double, which also included an assist, four steals and a block. He struggled considerably from the field, however, going just 5-of-17. Marcin Gorat tallied a 10-point, 14-rebound double-double, while Marcus Thornton paced the reserves with a 10-point effort. 

Okafor complemented his team-high scoring haul with five rebounds and two assists. Ilyasova added four boards to his 16 points. Gerald Henderson supplied 14 points, three assists, a rebound and a block. The bench was led by Nik Stauskas, who posted 15 points, two assists and a rebound. Saric responded to his demotion to the second unit with an impressive 13-point, 12-rebound double-double. Hollis Thompson also contributed 11 points in a reserve role, along with two rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

The Wizards head back home to face the New York Knicks on Thursday, while the Sixers head to Minnesota for their Thursday date with the Minnesota Timberwolves.

												The host Orlando Magic defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 89-82, at Amway Center on Wednesday. 

In a battle between two struggling teams, the Magic prevailed with a much needed win. Orlando held New Orleans to just 36 percent shooting from the field and forced them to commit 17 turnovers in their win. Orlando wasn't much better though, as they shot 39 percent from the field and 58 percent from the free-throw line. The Magic also dominated in the lane, as they scored 38 paint points to the Pelicans' 26. 

The Pelicans (2-10) had to play this game without Anthony Davis (thigh) and it clearly hurt their offense. Terrence Jones started for Davis though and carried the load, as he scored a game-high 26 points on 9-of-20 shooting. The only other starter in double figures was E'Twaun Moore, who tallied 14 points, three rebounds and four assists. Langston Galloway was a nice spark off the bench, scoring 15 points on 6-of-12 shooting. Omer Asik had a strange line, as he grabbed 10 rebounds, but failed to record another stat. The Pelicans will return to action on Friday when they host the Portland Trail Blazers for their next game. 

The Magic (5-7) have gotten off to a historically bad start offensively this season, but they were able to pull out a win here, thanks to some elite defense. Six players scored in double figures for the Magic, with Serge Ibaka and Evan Fournier tying the team lead with 16 a piece. Ibaka added eight rebounds to his 16 points and Fournier dished out three assists. Elfird Payton scored just five points, but provided four rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocks in the victory. Nikola Vucevic recorded a double-double, totaling 10 points and 14 rebounds. D.J. Augustin and Damjan Rudez each scored 11 points off the bench. Jeff Green had a game to forget, as he went scoreless on 0-of-9 shooting. Orlando will look to keep rolling against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 103-93, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday. 

The Cavaliers (9-2), coming off a hard-fought shootout with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, announced earlier in the day that both LeBron James and J.R. Smith would both miss the game for rest. That propelled Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert into the starting five, and put an even bigger-than-usual spotlight on Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The latter duo did combine for 51 points, but conversely, the pair of spot starters could only muster nine points overall. That left a certain scoring vacuum that Cleveland simply couldn't overcome, leading to only the second loss of the season for the defending champs. 

Love led all scorers with 27 points, 16 rebounds and an assist. Irving was next with 24 points, seven assists, two rebounds and a steal. With such a large share of the offensive responsibility, both players combined to put up 43 shot attempts. Tristan Thompson couldn't help on the scoreboard either, posting just two points, but he did haul in 12 rebounds, dished out three assists and recorded a block. Rookie Kay Felder and Jordan McRae paced the reserves with a pair of nine-point efforts, with the point total representing a career high for the former.

The Pacers (6-6) saw four-fifths of their first unit manage double-digit scoring and were led by Paul George, who supplied 21 points, 11 rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Jeff Teague registered 20 points, eight assists, four rebounds, a steal and a block. Thaddeus Young totaled 16 points, seven boards, an assist and a steal, while Myles Turner tallied 12 points, eight rebounds, four blocks and a steal. C.J. Miles paced the reserves with 10 points and a steal. 

The Cavaliers head back home for a Friday night date with the Detroit Pistons, while the Pacers remain home and await the Phoenix Suns for a Friday evening tussle.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 90-83, at TD Garden on Wednesday.

The Mavericks (2-8) checked into Wednesday scoring the third-least points per game in the league (94.9), and that trend would rear its ugly head yet again against a Boston squad that was ranked in the bottom 10 in points allowed. Playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles), Dallas got precious little production from anyone not named Harrison Barnes or Wesley Matthews. The two players combined for just over 60 percent of the team's point total, and the Mavs managed just a 41.8 percent success rate from the field overall. Meanwhile, although the Celtics (6-5) didn't have much more offensive balance on their end, they benefited greatly from a game-high 30 points from Isaiah Thomas, with 22 of those coming in the fourth quarter. 

Barnes led Dallas with 28 points, but couldn't contribute much else in the non-scoring categories, posting two rebounds, an assist and two steals. Matthews drained six-of-13 three-point attempts on his way to 22 points, and he added three rebounds and two steals. Deron Williams notably was scoreless over 10 minutes in his return from a multi-game absence due to a calf injury, while J.J. Barea paced the reserves with nine points, six assists, two rebounds and a steal over 28 minutes in his stead. Both Williams and Barea had to leave the game with injuries and were unable to return.

Thomas added six dimes and four rebounds to his scoring total. Avery Bradley posted an 18-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist. Kelly Olynyk drew another start in place of Al Horford (concussion) at power forward, totaling 10 points and four boards over 29 minutes. Amir Johnson filled out the stat sheet with eight points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals.

												The host New York Knicks defeated the Detroit Pistons, 105-102, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. 

These are two teams expected to battle for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and this game had a playoff atmosphere written all over it in a hard-fought matchup. While there were only eight ties and six lead changes, no team led by more than 12 points. New York actually held the lead for the final 30-plus minutes, but couldn't quite pull away. The key for the Knicks was their rebounding, as they snatched down 52 boards to the Pistons' 40. Offensive rebounding was especially decisive, with New York grabbing 19 of those to Detroit's eight. In addition to that, the Knicks recorded nine blocks, while the Pistons swatted away just one shot on their end. 

Detroit (6-6) continues to struggle on the road this season, as they are now 1-6 outside of Detroit. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the team in scoring with 21 points, but missed an open game-tying three with two seconds left. Tobias Harris was second on the team in scoring, as he totaled 19 points and 10 rebounds. Andre Drummond made a return from a one-game absence to score 15 points and grab nine boards in the loss. Ish Smith tallied 14 points and eight assists on an efficient 6-of-7 shooting. Jon Leuer was the only bench player with more than seven points, as he dropped 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. Detroit will have to step up their road game, as they travel to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday for their next fixture.  

New York (5-6) got a much needed win here and Kristaps Porzingis carried the load. In fact, Porzingis dropped a career-high 35 points on 13-of-22 shooting. He also added seven rebounds and three assists in his best game of the year. Carmelo Anthony tallied 22 points, five rebounds and three assists of his own in the victory. Derrick Rose was the only other Knick in double figures, scoring 15 points, while adding five rebounds and three assists. Joakim Noah scored just seven points, but provided 15 rebounds, three assists and three blocks out of the center position. On deck for New York is a road matchup against the Washington Wizards on Thursday.

												The host Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 107-100, at Philips Arena on Wednesday. 

Most of the statistics would indicate a Milwaukee win, but Atlanta prevailed thanks to great teamwork. The second quarter was especially decisive, as the Hawks outscored the Bucks 31-9 in that 12-minute stretch. Strangely, Milwaukee took 26 more shots than Atlanta, but made only four more baskets. The Bucks also dominated in the paint, outscoring the Hawks 50-28. Atlanta was extremely efficient though, as they shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 29 of their 35 made baskets. They also took care of business at the charity stripe, going 27-of-31 from the free-throw line. 

Milwaukee (5-5) had their opportunities to win this game, but they realized how tough it is to beat an efficient Atlanta team. Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load, as he tallied 26 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists. Jabari Parker was great as well, totaling 23 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals of his own. The only other starter in double figures was Tony Snell, who amassed 11 points, four rebounds and three assists. Mirza Teletovic was a nice spark off the bench, as he scored 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting. Milwaukee will be on back-to-back duties, as they travel to face the Miami Heat on Thursday for their next game. 

Atlanta (9-2) had to play this game without Dwight Howard (quad), but they didn't miss a beat. Paul Millsap stepped up in his absence, as he tallied 21 points, eight rebounds and three assists in the win. Mike Muscala started for Howard and provided 16 points, five rebounds and three assists of his own. Kyle Korver had one of his best games of the season, totaling 11 points, six rebounds and five assists. All five starters for Atlanta scored at least 11 points and provided at least three rebounds and three assists. On deck for the Hawks is a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Houston Rockets, 105-103, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday.

It was built up as a matchup between the two assist leaders in the NBA, with James Harden's league-best 12.6 assists per game going up against Russell Westbrook's 9.9. In the end, Harden did manage to out-pass Westbrook, dishing out 13 assists to Russell's nine, but Westbrook dominated Harden in every other aspect of the game. Most importantly, he got the win as he lead the Thunder (7-5) on a late surge. Westbrook finished the night with a game-high 30 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. The only other Oklahoma City player to score in double figures was Victor Oladipo, who put together what was easily his best performance of the season, recording a season-high 29 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and two steals. It was essentially a two-man show for the Thunder, but it was enough to seal the victory.

For the Rockets (6-5), while Harden continued to be a great floor leader, he struggled to put together a stellar offensive performance, scoring just 13 points on 4-of-16 shooting. Eric Gordon matched Harden's 13, but shot an even worse 5-of-20 from the field. As a team, Houston had seven players score in double figures, but no one managed to score higher than Ryan Anderson's 14, and in total, the Rockets shot just 43.5 percent from the field in a game they still managed to keep close. 

Up next for the Thunder, they will stay at home to take on the Nets on Friday, while the Rockets will head home on Thursday to play the Trail Blazers.

												The visiting Golden State Warriors defeated the Toronto Raptors, 127-121, on Wednesday at Air Canada Center. 

Both teams got off to a scorching hot start, scoring a combined 72 points in the first quarter, with the Raptors (7-4) taking an early four-point lead. But then, the Warriors (9-2) decided to take it to another level in the second period, dismantling Toronto in a second quarter that ended with Golden State taking a 66-53 lead into halftime -- a lead that they would not give up from that point on. Despite a late push from the Raptors in the closing moments of the game, the Warriors, led by 35 points from Steph Curry and 30 from Durant, ended up being far too much to handle. Klay Thompson had a rough night shooting, going just 4-of-15 from the field en route to 15 points. 

For the Raptors, DeMar DeRozan maintained his spot as the top scorer in the league with 34 points on top of four rebounds and six assists. That is his ninth 30-point game of the season and his scoring average is now up to 33.3 points per game. Kyle Lowry added 24 points of his own, to go along with five rebounds and five assists, but the effort from Toronto's two All-Stars was simply not enough in the end. The loss came despite the Raptors managing to get to the line 41 times and making a grand total of 37 free throws. 

Up next, the Warriors will look to earn their sixth straight win of the season against the Celtics on Friday, while the Raptors will hope to end their two-game losing streak Friday against the Nuggets.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns, 120-104, at Pepsi Center on Wednesday.

The Nuggets (4-7) essentially had control of the game from start to finish, holding off every Suns' (3-9) run en route to earning their first win at home this season. Wilson Chandler led the way off the bench for Denver, putting together his best game of the season, recording a team-high 28 points on top of 11 rebounds and five assists. It marks the first time Chandler has scored at least 28 points since April of 2015. Kenneth Faried also had what was easily his best game of the season, notching a double-double -- his second straight -- of 20 points and 15 rebounds. Over his last two games, Faried has totaled 38 points and 29 rebounds. 

For the Suns, Wednesday's loss was their third in a row and fifth in six games, as it was a struggle for the majority of the team's rotation. While Devin Booker put together a 24-point performance, the rest of Phoenix's starters scored a combined 23 points. If it wasn't for Brandon Knight's heroic 32-point performance in 27 minutes off the bench, this game could have been even uglier for the Suns. In the end, the game was lost for Phoenix at the free throw line, where they shot an impressive 29 times and managed to convert just 18. 

Up next, the Nuggets will look to continue their winning ways against the Raptors on Friday, while the Suns will attempt to turn things around Friday against the Pacers.

												The visiting Memphis Grizzlies snapped the host Los Angeles Clippers' seven-game win streak with a 111-107 win on Wednesday.

After a historically strong start to the season, the Clippers (10-2) took their second loss in heartbreaking fashion. Memphis came out strong in the second quarter, establishing a 15-point lead by halftime. Los Angeles was able to fight back and hold the lead with under 30 seconds to go in the game. However, a foul and turnover put the Clippers up just one with 14 seconds remaining, at which point Grizzlies' (6-5) center Marc Gasol hit a game-winning three-pointer. The Clippers missed their opportunity to tie or win on the final possession, as the ball slipped out of guard J.J. Redick's hands to give Memphis the game.  

Memphis was able to do what no team had done to Los Angeles yet this season: score in bunches from beyond the three-point line. The Grizzlies hit 15 three-pointers on 57 percent shooting from beyond the arc. 11 of those makes came from point guard Mike Conley, who led the team with 30 points, and Gasol, who had 26 points and the game-winner. Conley was able to shoot 9-of-12 from the field while also dishing out eight assists and holding Clippers' All-Star Chris Paul to just nine points.

Los Angeles, meanwhile, struggled in large part due to Paul's off night. The All-Star had just nine points on 3-of-11 shooting, and recorded only six assists. While Redick, who ultimately fumbled the potential game-winner, had a season-high 29 points, while he accounted for seven of the Clippers' nine three-pointers. All-Star forward Blake Griffin was integral in leading the comeback effort for LA, however, posting 25 points, eight rebounds, and three assists without a turnover.  

Both teams will take the road on Friday, with the Grizzlies visiting Dallas and the Clippers seeing Sacramento.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs defeated the Kings, 110-105, at Golden 1 Center on Wednesday.

The Spurs (9-3) lead by double-digits at halftime and were able to maintain control until late in the fourth quarter. All three starting members of San Antonio's frontcourt scored 20 or more points in the win, with veteran big man Pau Gasol scoring a season-high 24 to lead the team. Despite San Antonio's offensive dominance in the paint, the team struggled in the rebounding column, being edged out 46-37. This was largely due to a strong showing from Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins, who posted a game-high 17 rebounds. Despite this, strong scoring inside helped lift the Spurs to a tight victory. Reigning Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard also shored up San Antonio's defense with four steals. The Spurs remain situated at third in the Western Conference.

Sacramento (4-8), meanwhile, continues to struggle early in the season despite strong play from their stars. In addition to his superb rebounding, Cousins scored a game-high 26 points and dished six assists. The rest of the starting five struggled, however, combining for just 22 points. Despite the loss, Sacramento was able to make the game promisingly close against a strong Spurs team. The Kings' bench also showed promise, scoring 47 points on the night.

The Spurs will visit the Lakers on Friday, while the Kings will host the Clippers on Friday as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Toronto Raptors, 121-117, at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday. 

The two teams had already engaged in a tight defensive battle in the second game of the season, with the Cavs emerging as 94-91 victors. Tuesday saw a completely different game unfold, with both teams exploding for some of their best point totals of the season. As usual, Cleveland (8-1) was led by the Big Three of Kyrie Irving, LeBron James and Kevin Love, who combined for 71 of the Cavs' 121 points, which included double-doubles from the latter two. Strong performances from Tristan Thompson and Channing Frye also helped lead to a stellar 53.3 percent team tally from the field.

The Raptors (7-3) were led by Kyle Lowry, who posted a near double-double with 28 points, nine assists, five rebounds and four steals. DeMar DeRozan followed with 26 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals, but struggled from the field, going just 10-of-27. Jonas Valanciunas compiled 14 points, nine rebounds and a pair of dimes. Norman Powell drew the start at small forward and contributed 12 points, three rebounds, three assists and a block. Terrence Ross paced the reserves with an 18-point effort that he complemented with three rebounds and two steals. His impressive performance included a 4-of-7 tally from three-point range.

James scored a team-high 28 points and added 14 assists, nine boards and a steal, but committed a game-high five turnovers as well. Irving supplied 24 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals, although he also handed the ball to the opposition on five occasions. Love registered a 19-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included an assist and three blocks. Thompson got in on the act with 15 points, 11 boards and a block, while Frye paced the bench with 21 points in just 20 minutes. He also hit a huge three-point jumper with 59 seconds remaining that gave Cleveland a 117-115 lead that they wouldn't relinquish again. 

The Raptors head back home to take on the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Cavaliers hit the road for their own Wednesday night tussle with the Indiana Pacers.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Miami Heat, 93-90, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday.

Despite the victory, the Hawks (8-2) did not get off to the best start against a depleted Heat (2-8) squad. Atlanta struggled to get a lead over Miami and didn't pull ahead until there was just over two minutes left in the second period. From there, it was a game of runs as the teams traded leads before the Hawks were able to hold off one last push of desperation by Miami. Atlanta did, however, lose Dwight Howard late in the third quarter, as he left the game with a left quad contusion and did not return. He did still manage to finish with a double-double of 11 points and 11 rebounds in just 25 minutes. In the end, Dennis Schroder led the way for Atlanta, scoring 18 points and dishing out four assists, while Paul Millsap, who ended up playing a solid dose of minutes at the center position, posted 15 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals Tuesday night.

For the Heat, it was yet another dominant performance from center Hassan Whiteside, who finished with 19 points and 25 rebounds en route to his ninth double-double of the season. Josh Richardson matched Whiteside's 19 points in 38 minutes, as he looks to be fully healthy after missing the start of the season with a knee injury. Dion Waiters, however, who is filling in as the team's starting point guard with Goran Dragic (ankle) out, struggled from the field, shooting 5-of-18 and scoring just 11 points. Justise Winslow also missed Tuesday's game with a wrist injury.

Up next, the Hawks will look to keep rolling at home against Milwaukee on Wednesday, while the Heat will look to turn things around against the Bucks on Thursday.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves, 115-108, at Target Center on Tuesday. 

In a game full of swings, the Hornets made the final and most decisive one. A 21-4 run in the third quarter gave Charlotte a lead after trailing by double-digits in the first half. In fact, the Timberwolves won the second quarter 28-15, while the Hornets responded with a 36-17 third quarter of their own. The Hornets were lights out with their jumpers, as they shot 53 percent from the field and 46 percent from three-point range. Charlotte also dominated in the lane, scoring 50 paint points to the Timberwolves' 28. There were nine ties and 16 lead changes in total.

The Hornets (7-3) have been one of the surprises of the season and a comeback road win here just adds to their impressive resume'. Kemba Walker continued his great play, as he tallied 30 points, five rebounds, six assists and five steals in the win. Frank Kaminsky was second on the team, as he totaled 20 points, four rebounds and five assists off the bench. Nicolas Batum provided 16 points, five rebounds, seven assists and three steals of his own. Cody Zeller fell a rebound shy of a double-double, finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds. Charlotte will be off until Friday, when they host the Atlanta Hawks for their next game. 

The Timberwolves (3-7) continue to disappoint and falling apart in the third quarter has become all too common of a trend. They were being outscored by eight points a game in the third coming into this matchup and a 19-point third quarter deficit Tuesday only worsens those numbers. Andrew Wiggins led the team in scoring, as he dropped 29 points on 10-of-24 shooting. Karl-Anthony Towns was second on the team, with his 21 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Ricky Rubio flirted with a triple-double, accumulating 11 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the loss. Zach LaVine made his return from a one-game absence to score 21 points on 7-of-16 shooting. Minnesota will look to play better on Thursday in a favorable home matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers.

												The visiting Chicago Bulls demolished the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, 113-88.

It was a rebounding extravaganza for Chicago (7-4), as the team pulled down a ridiculous 67 boards in the easy win. 19 offensive rebounds helped the team earn second-chance points left and right, and contributed to the Bulls jumping out to the early 35-14 lead. All-Star Jimmy Butler, fresh off a 37-point outing against the Wizards, led the team in both points and rebounds, with 27 and 12 respectively. Forward Taj Gibson and center Robin Lopez also posted double-doubles, recording 11 rebounds each. Starting point guard Rajon Rondo was sidelined with an ankle sprain, but backup Jerian Grant was able to fill the starting role nicely, scoring 18 points and coming away with five steals.

For Portland (7-5), it was an uncharacteristically cold shooting night. The league's second-leading scorer heading into the night, Damian Lillard, scored only 19 points on just 7-of-22 shooting. The stagnant offense went beyond Lillard, however, as the team shot just 35 percent from the floor and 26 percent from three-point range. Struggles extended to the free-throw line, where the team hit just 11-of-18 shots from the stripe. Despite an inability to get things going offensively, Portland was able to post a low total of just 11 turnovers in the fast-paced game.

Both teams will head on the road Thursday, with the Blazers visiting Houston and Chicago seeing Utah.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers beat the visiting Brooklyn Nets, 125-118, on Tuesday.

Tuesday's match was an exhibition of the young talent that Los Angeles (7-5) has, as third-year forward Julius Randle and sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell helped guide the team to victory. Randle earned his second career triple-double, posting 17 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists. Russell, meanwhile, scored a season-high 32 points and hit a whopping seven three-pointers. Another youngster, guard Jordan Clarkson, had a near double-double off the bench, scoring 12 points and coming away with nine rebounds. Overall, the Lakers were able to ride solid rebounding to a narrow victory, as they came away with an eight-board advantage at the end of the day.

Brooklyn (4-7) suffered its second loss in two days at Staples Center, after being demolished by the Clippers on Monday. Center Brook Lopez was able to rest in Monday's matchup and showed off his fresh legs with a 30-point, 10-rebound double-double against the Lakers. Guard Bojan Bogdanovic, meanwhile, built on a solid performance on Monday to deliver an impressive 29-point outing in the second half of Brooklyn's back-to-back. Minimal bench contributions were seen for Brooklyn, however, as the team fell to two games below .500.

The Nets will visit the Thunder on Friday, while the Lakers will host the Spurs on that same day.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Orlando Magic, 88-69, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday.

The Pacers (5-6) weren't sure that they'd have Paul George (ankle) available to help try to break a two-game losing streak until late in the afternoon, but he ultimately was able to suit up and share the co-lead in scoring among the starting five. He also helped spearhead a defensive effort that saw Indiana limit the Magic (4-7) to a 32.1 percent success rate from the field and a 20 percent tally from three-point range, while also holding them to a season-low point total. They also elicited a total of 14 turnovers from Orlando while turning the ball over just nine times in their own right. The key for the Pacers was their play in the two middle quarters, as they outscored the visitors by a 55-38 margin over the second and third periods.

Orlando was paced by Evan Fournier, who supplied 14 points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal. Elfrid Payton managed 12 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals, while Nikola Vucevic struggled through an uncharacteristic 1-of-10 effort from the field, an unsightly performance that he nevertheless managed to somewhat compensate for with 12 rebounds. Aaron Gordon was the only other Magic player to hit double digits in the scoring column, pacing the bench with 11 points, three boards and an assist.

George and Monta Ellis each turned in 13-point efforts, with the former posting six rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block, while the latter had a pair of rebounds and assists, to go along with a block. Thaddeus Young provided a solid complementary effort with 11 points, five rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block. Jeff Teague filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, eight rebounds, five assists, a steal and three blocks. C.J. Miles led the reserves with 16 points, four rebounds, an assist, two steals and two blocks. 

The Magic head back home to await the New Orleans Pelicans for a Wednesday visit, while the Pacers have their own Wednesday home date with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 93-77, at Madison Square Garden on Monday.

The Knicks (4-6) came in losers of two straight and looking for an immediate improvement of a porous defense that had allowed an average of 109.8 points coming in. They were able to right both matters for the moment Monday, stifling the Dallas Mavericks (2-7) to the tune of a season-low point total. Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis led the way as usual, contributing a pair of 24-point efforts. One particularly notable item from the home team's stat sheet was Justin Holiday's play as compared to that of Joakim Noah, who he replaced to start the second half. While the latter went scoreless over 15 minutes, the former posted 16 points over 25 minutes on the floor, leading the bench. 

The Mavericks, playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles), were led by Harrison Barnes, who supplied 20 points, four rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. J.J. Barea drew another start in place of Deron Williams (calf), registering 17 points, four assists and a rebound. Unfortunately for Dallas, that was it for double-digit scoring performances, as they shot just 38.6 percent from the field and posted an unsightly 5-of-28 tally (17.9 percent) from beyond the arc. Seth Curry paced the bench with nine points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal, but was 1-of-7 himself from three-point range. 

Anthony added seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block to his scoring haul, while Porzingis complemented his point total with 11 boards, an assist and a block. However, the trio of Noah, Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee combined for just 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting. Holiday, who helped spearhead a second-half-opening 19-6 run, added four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block to his aforementioned 16 points. 

The Mavericks continue their tour through the Northeast with a Wednesday showdown in Boston against the Celtics, while the Knicks remain home for their Wednesday date with the Pistons.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 104-88, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday.

The Pistons have been a different team at home this season, as this win made them 5-0 at Palace of Auburn Hills. Defense was key for Detroit, as they held Oklahoma City to 38 percent from the field and 19 percent from three-point range. They also dominated the paint, as they scored 60 points in the paint to the Thunder's 44. Detroit never relinquished the lead after the first quarter, as they led by 19 points at the peak of their win. 

Oklahoma City (6-5) has been living off the production of Russell Westbrook this season and he simply didn't have any help in this loss. Westbrook finished the game with 33 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, with no other starter reaching double figures in any statistic aside from minutes. Victor Oladipo really struggled, as he scored just nine points on 4-of-17 shooting. Enes Kanter and Jerami Grant played well off the bench, combining for 21 points and eight rebounds. Steven Adams scored just four points, but grabbed 11 rebounds in the defeat. On deck is a home matchup against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, in what should be a high-scoring game. 

Detroit (6-5) had to play this game without center Andre Drummond (ankle), but they didn't miss a beat. Aron Baynes filled in for Drummond and totaled 20 points and eight rebounds on 8-of-13 shooting in his best game of the season. Tobias Harris led the team in scoring, dropping 22 points, six rebounds and three assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope tallied 17 points, three rebounds and four assists of his own. Detroit's next game will be on Wednesday, when they travel to face the New York Knicks.

												The host New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Boston Celtics, 106-105, at Smoothie King Center on Monday. 

While there were only eight ties and six lead changes, this game came down to the final seconds. The key for New Orleans was their defense, as they held Boston to 40 percent from the field and 29 percent from three-point range. Rim protection killed Boston as well, as they failed to record a block in their loss. The assist-to-turnover ratio kept the Celtics hanging around, as they committed 12 turnovers to 19 assists, while the Pelicans committed 17 turnovers to their 16 assists. 

The Celtics (5-5) continue to struggle without Al Horford (concussion) and Jae Crowder (ankle) and this was easily their worst loss of the season. Isaiah Thomas did his best to carry Boston to a win though, tallying 37 points, three rebounds and seven assists. Avery Bradley continued his surprising rebounding rate, as he totaled 19 points and 10 rebounds in the loss. Marcus Smart was the only other Boston player in double figures, amassing 15 points, six rebounds, three assists and four steals. Boston will look to rebound on Wednesday, when they host the Dallas Mavericks for their next game.

The Pelicans (2-9) got a much needed win here, but it was far from easy. Anthony Davis once again led the team, as he accumulated 25 points, 16 rebounds and four steals in the win. Tim Frazier was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 10 points, three rebounds and six assists. Langston Galloway and Terrence Jones were both huge off the bench. Galloway finished with 21 points, while Jones double-doubled with a 15-point, 10-rebound performance. On deck for the Pelicans is a road matchup against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 115-88, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday. 

James Harden had no problem leading the Rockets (6-4) past the 76ers (1-9) on the road. The de facto leader of the Rockets commanded the floor and spread the court to his liking against a big man heavy Philadelphia squad. Houston took a 12-point lead at the end of the first quarter and simply expanded on it, all the way up to as much as 30 points late in the second half. Philadelphia only managed eight points from halfway through the third quarter to the end of that period, which put the game completely out of reach. 

The bright spot for the 76ers continues to come from Joel Embiid, who played well over his 23 minutes, save for the six turnovers during that span. Embiid went on to score 13 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, blocked two shots and added one steal on 6-of-10 shooting. Harden led the way for Houston with 33 points, nine assists and seven rebounds on 12-of-20 shooting, including four three-pointers. Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza combined for 33 points to aid Harden in the blowout. 

Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Rockets visit the Oklahoma City Thunder, while the 76ers host the Washington Wizards.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Miami Heat, 94-90, on Monday at AT&T Center. 

For the Spurs (8-3), Monday's game marked just the second time this season where the team was able to start their lineup they expected to have out there from the beginning of the season, as Danny Green and Tony Parker have made returns from quad and knee injuries, respectively. Regardless, it was still Kawhi Leonard who led the way for San Antonio in their victory, posting a team-high 24 points and 12 rebounds in 35 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 points of his own while Pau Gasol posted 12 points and eight rebounds, as the Spurs' starting frontcourt carried the team to their third straight victory. Although it didn't come easy in the closing moments, as despite holding an 11-point lead heading into the final quarter, a late Miami (2-7) run made the final seconds somewhat competitive. 

For the Heat, they continue to struggle as they have now lost their fifth straight game, but center Hassan Whiteside did manage to put together yet another monster performance, scoring 23 points off 9-of-11 shooting and grabbing 17 rebounds in 34 minutes. With Goran Dragic out with an ankle injury, however, it was Dion Waiters who led the team in scoring, posting a game-high 27 points in Dragic's absence. Beyond Waiters and Whiteside, Miami didn't get much help, as Tyler Johnson was the only other player to score in double figures, scoring 11 points in 33 minutes off the bench. Offensive struggles continue to haunt the Heat, as they've failed to score 100 points in each of their last five games. 

Up next, the Spurs will head to Sacramento on Wednesday to take on the Kings, while the Heat will look to end their losing streak at home against the Hawks on Tuesday.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Utah Jazz, 102-96, at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Monday. 

The Grizzlies (5-5) used a late fourth-quarter surge to secure their first road victory on Monday, after dropping their first three away from home to start the season. They did so with yet another great performance from Vince Carter off the bench, as he continues to turn back the clock in his 19th NBA season. Carter had 20 points on 6-of-11 shooting in 31 minutes as a reserve -- his third straight game with at least 17 points. Zach Randolph added a great performance off the bench himself, scoring 18 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in just 23 minutes to notch his third double-double of the season. For the starters, it was Marc Gasol and Mike Conley who carried the load, scoring 22 and 18 points respectively. 

For the Jazz (7-5), on top of losing Monday's game, they also lost their starting power forward Derrick Favors, as he left the game with left knee soreness after 21 minutes of playing time. Favors has been bothered with knee issues since before the season even started, and it is possible the team is now extra cautious with their star forward, opening the door for second-year player Trey Lyles to play a bigger role. The power forward out of Kentucky was great in 32 minutes off the bench, scoring 18 points on 6-of-12 shooting. Gordon Hayward, who has been unstoppable as of late with five straight games of at least 20 points, struggled mightily, shooting just 4-of-14 from the field and 1-of-7 from behind the arc en route to just 13 points. With Favors potentially out for an indefinite amount of time, the burden will be on Hayward to regain his scoring mojo and carry the load for a Utah team that isn't very prolific offensively. 

Up next, the Grizzlies will head to Los Angeles on Wednesday to take on the red-hot Clippers, while the Jazz will have off until Thursday when they take on Chicago at home.

												The host Los Angeles Clippers demolished the Brooklyn Nets, 127-95, at Staples Center on Monday night.

The Clippers (10-1) became the first team to reach 10 wins on the season with Monday's victory, and have made quick work of most teams on their run. One of the key factors to their success has been its league-best defense, which was on full display against Brooklyn. The Clippers held their opponents to 44 percent shooting and forced 21 turnovers on the night. Big man Mo Speights provided an extra defensive boost for LA, recording two steals and three blocks off the bench. Defense wasn't the only story, however, as the Clippers were able to score a ridiculous 127 points on 53 percent shooting. Point guard Chris Paul led the offense with 21 points and nine assists, while All-Star power forward Blake Griffin trailed not far behind with 20 points and six assists. Los Angeles was able to score seemingly at will from beyond the three-point line, as the team shot 56 percent from three-point range.

Brooklyn (4-6), meanwhile, was bitten with the injury bug prior to the contest. Point guard Jeremy Lin (hamstring) as well as backup Isaiah Whitehead (concussion) were sidelined, while star center Brook Lopez was given the game off to rest. The absence of key players did the Nets no favors, as the team struggled mightily on both ends of the floor. Former No. 1 overall pick turned D-League call-up, Anthony Bennett was forced to play 26 minutes, shooting just 2-of-8 during that stretch. The game was put out of reach for Brooklyn almost immediately, as Los Angeles took a 39-14 lead in the first quarter.

The Nets will stay at Staples Center to play the Lakers on Tuesday, while the Clippers will host the Grizzlies on Wednesday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 100-93, at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday.

More often than not, the trio of LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving are essentially enough to overcome most opponents. It was a different story Sunday, however, as veteran Channing Frye actually led the way with a season-high 20-point effort in 25 minutes off the bench. The aforementioned starters weren't necessarily underwhelming, as they combined for 55 points, including four total three-pointers from Love and James. Defense was also undeniably a factor, as Cleveland (8-1) held the Hornets (6-3) to 37.9 percent success rates from both the field and three-point range.

The Hornets were led by Kemba Walker, who tallied 21 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal. Marvin Williams posted 16 points, six rebounds and two assists. Nicolas Batum managed a near double-double with 15 points, nine boards, seven assists, two steals and a block. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist did get there, supplying 11 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and a steal. 

Frye added three rebounds and three blocks to his team-high scoring total. A pair of 19-point efforts from James and Irving paced the starting five, with the former also filling out the stat sheet with eight rebounds, eight assists, a steal and a block and the latter dishing out four assists, posting three rebounds and recording a steal. Love was strong as well, pouring in 17 points and bringing in 11 rebounds, four assists and a steal. Tristan Thompson mustered a modest four points, but did bring in 12 rebounds.

The Hornets move on to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Tuesday night, while the Cavaliers remain home to take on the Raptors on Tuesday evening as well.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the host Oklahoma City Thunder 119-117 at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday. 

In a game full of revenge narratives, Serge Ibaka had the last laugh. The former Oklahoma City product dropped a career-high 31 points and hit the game-winning basket with 0.4 seconds left. Orlando actually had a 21-point lead in the first half, before Oklahoma City went on a 17-2 run in the third quarter to make it a game. Both teams shot well, as they each eclipsed 50 percent from the field. Three-point shooting was the big disparity, as the Magic went 11-of-24, while the Thunder went 7-of-25. The Thunder really hurt themselves at the free-throw line as well, going 16-of-26 in the defeat.

Orlando (4-6) had the worst offense in the league coming into this game, so a 119-point performance is just what the doctor ordered. Ibaka was the hero though, as he punished his former team with a career-high 31 points, nine rebounds and four blocks on 13-of-19 shooting. Elfrid Payton had his best game of the season as well, accumulating 23 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. Evan Fournier provided 21 points of his own on 7-of-10 shooting. Aaron Gordon and D.J. Augustin scored 12 a piece off the bench. The Magic's next game will be on Monday against the Indiana Pacers.

Oklahoma City (6-4) has lived off Russell Westbrook's absurd production and he gave them yet another stellar performance here. Westbrook tallied 41 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists en route to another triple-double. Steven Adams recorded a double-double of his own, totaling 13 points and 10 rebounds. Victor Oladipo also played a revenge game against his former team, but scored just 12 points on an efficient 6-of-9 from the field. Enes Kanter scored 16 points and grabbed eight boards off the bench. Oklahoma City will be in action again on Monday, as they travel to face the Detroit Pistons.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 125-99 at Target Center on Sunday.

At the beginning of the season, the Timberwolves were supposed to be the young surprise team in the league, but the Lakers have taken that crown thus far. That wasn't the case here though, as Minnesota dominated throughout this game. Offense was key for the Timberwolves, as they shot 53 percent from the field and 48 percent from three-point range. The assist-to-turnover ratio was huge as well, with Los Angeles committing 17 turnovers to their 16 assists, while Minnesota committed just 10 turnovers to 28 assists. A 25-5 run in the second quarter is when the Timberwolves really pulled away, as the Lakers couldn't recover after that.  

Los Angeles (6-5) had to play this game in the second half of a back-to-back set and it clearly slowed them down in this loss. The bench carried the load, as Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram and Lou Williams all scored in double figures. Williams led the team in scoring, tallying 17 points, five rebounds and four assists. Julius Randle led the starters in scoring, dropping 14 points, six rebounds and three assists. Clarkson also scored 14 points on 6-of-10 shooting. Los Angeles will look to bounce back on Tuesday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets for their next game. 

Minnesota (3-6) has gotten off to a rough start this season, but dominating wins like this mean a lot going forward. Andrew Wiggins was the player of the game, as he tallied a career-high 47 points on 14-of-21 from the field and 17-of-22 from the free-throw line. Despite Karl-Anthony Towns going 7-of-22 from the field, he still finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds. Nemanja Bjelica made a spot start for Zach LaVine (knee) and totaled 24 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals in a great fill-in performance.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns on Sunday, 133-120.

It was a close game throughout, with just two points separating the teams with five minutes to go. Strong play late from forward Kevin Durant helped the Warriors (8-2) secure the double-digit victory. The former MVP contributed 29 points, nine rebounds, and five assists to the effort.  Despite the high scoring total for Durant, he was just the third-highest scorer on the team. The 'Splash Brothers,' Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, scored 30 points each, both hitting five three-pointers en route to the victory. It was a fast-paced and high scoring game for both teams, with little defense played on either side. Both teams were able to shoot over 51 percent from the floor.

A key piece to the Suns' (3-8) strong shooting was small forward T.J. Warren. Warren has been enjoying a breakout season thus far, and once again led Phoenix in scoring on Sunday. Warren finished with 20 points on 10-of-18 from the field, also recording four steals. Sophomore Devin Booker had 19 points, but on a much less efficient 6-of-18 from the field, while point guard Eric Bledsoe scored 20 and dished out five assists. The absence of center Tyson Chandler was certainly felt by Phoenix, as the team recorded just 38 rebounds on the night. Chandler missed the game following the passing away of his mother earlier in the week.

Both teams will travel for their next matchups on Wednesday, with the Suns visiting Denver and the Warriors traveling to Toronto.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the visiting Denver Nuggets on Sunday, 112-105.

After trailing by double-digits midway through the second quarter, Portland rallied to catch up and establish a significant lead. A 36-15 advantage in the third quarter helped the Blazers (7-4) to regain control of the game. It was another strong performance for star point guard Damian Lillard, who is averaging over 30 points per game and leading the Blazers in assists. Lillard scored 32 on Sunday to go along with eight rebounds and six assists.  Lillard's backcourt partner, C.J. McCollum, contributed significantly as well, scoring 21 points. While Portland's starting five saw success, the Blazers' bench struggled, shooting just 7-of-29 on the night.  

After what had been a promising start to the season for Denver (3-7), the Nuggets have now lost four consecutive games. The Nuggets remain among the league's top rebounding teams, as the team displayed by earning a 59-44 rebounding advantage against the Blazers. However, Denver's shooting woes were on full display Sunday, particularly among their young players. The team shot just 39 percent from the field, with sophomore point guard Emmanuel Mudiay shooting just 3-of-16 on the night.

Portland will host the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday, while Denver will host the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans 126-99 at Smoothie King Center on Saturday. 

The third quarter is when Los Angeles pulled away, as they outscored New Orleans 29-15. The fourth was just as ugly, with Los Angeles outscoring New Orleans 42-28. The Lakers actually went on a 14-0 run after Anthony Davis suffered a back injury in the third, as the Pelicans let the game get away. Luckily, Davis was able to return, but the game was too far out of hand at that point to recover. The Lakers won this game through offensive efficiency, as they shot 55 percent from the field and 53 percent from three-point range. In addition, they assisted on 36 of their 51 made baskets.

The Lakers (6-4) have been one of the surprise teams of the league and they took advantage of a disheartened Pelicans team here. Much of the offense was run through Julius Randle, as he accumulated eight points, 11 rebounds, eight assists, two steals and two blocks in the victory. Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson were fantastic off the bench, as they each scored 20-plus in the win. Clarkson led the team in scoring, tallying 23 points on 8-of-12 shooting, while Williams finished with 21 points, three rebounds and four assists. D'Angelo Russell amassed 22 points and six assists of his own. Los Angeles will play again on Sunday, as they travel to play the Minnesota Timberwolves

The Pelicans (1-9) continue to be a huge disappointment and losses to teams like the Lakers doesn't help their cause. Anthony Davis did leave for a few minutes in the third quarter with a back injury, but still dominated with 34 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in 34 minutes. Tim Frazier was the only other starter to play well, as he totaled four points and 10 assists. The other three starters combined for just 12 points, 12 rebounds and one assist. Buddy Hield had his best game in the NBA, scoring a career-high 18 points on 8-of-13 shooting off the bench. New Orleans returns to action on Monday, when they host the Boston Celtics for their next game.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the host Indiana Pacers 105-99 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday.

In a battle between two injury-riddled teams, the Celtics were able to prevail with a much needed road victory. The key was shooting and defense, as the Celtics outshot the Pacers from the field, from three-point range and from the free-throw line. Boston also held Indiana to 42 percent from the field and 22 percent from long distance. The Celtics also won the rebounding and assisting differentials, while tying the Pacers in turnovers. There were 10 ties and 10 lead changes, as this game went down to the final seconds. 

Boston (5-4) has had to deal with a gluttony of injuries, but they had the fortunate task of playing a team just as injured here. Isaiah Thomas led the team in scoring, totaling 23 points and five assists on 4-of-13 shooting. He got most of those points by going 14-of-15 from the free-throw line. Kelly Olynyk got a rare start and finished second on the team with his 16 points, six rebounds and four assists. Avery Bradley also tallied 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists, while Amir Johnson finished with 14 points and nine boards. Boston will return to action on Monday against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Indiana (4-6) had a tough task here without Paul George and they simply couldn't overcome that loss. Jeff Teague led the team with 20 points and four assists, but shot just 4-of-13 from the field. Myles Turner was a defensive stud, totaling 17 points, eight rebounds, four steals and three blocks in the defeat. Monta Ellis was back in the starting lineup, finishing with 15 points, four rebounds and four assists. The Pacers will look to rebound on Monday, when they host the Orlando Magic for their next game.

												The host Toronto Raptors defeated the New York Knicks 118-107 at Air Canada Centre on Saturday. 

Despite the scoreline showing a double-digit margin, this game was close throughout. In fact, there were 20 ties and 27 lead changes, with these two teams battling all night long. The Raptors turned it on late though, as they turned a tied ball game with six minutes left into an 11-point win. Free-throw shooting was the difference in the game, as Toronto went 33-of-38, while New York went just 12-of-16. The Raptors also dominated the hustle stats, recording 16 combined steals and blocks to the Knicks' five. That also led to 20 fastbreak points for Toronto, with New York finishing with only six.

New York (3-6) has gotten off to a rough start this season, but this is not a loss to be concerned with. After getting ejected on Friday, Carmelo Anthony bounced back with 31 points, six rebounds and four assists here. Derrick Rose and Kristaps Porzingis tied for second on the team in scoring, as they each dropped 21 points and grabbed four boards in the loss. While Joakim Noah finished with just four points and one assist, he did grab 18 rebounds out of the center position. The Knicks next game will be on Monday, when they host the struggling Dallas Mavericks.

Toronto (7-2) is as dominant as anyone at home and they continue to abuse weak Eastern Conference teams. DeMar DeRozan added on to his torrid pace, as he tallied 33 points, seven rebounds and four assists in this win. Norman Powell got his first start of the season and scored 19 points thanks to an 8-of-8 showing from the free-throw line. Kyle Lowry accumulated 16 points, six rebounds and six assists in 40 minutes of action. Lucas Nogueira was a huge spark off the bench, totaling six points, 10 rebounds, three steals and five blocks in the victory. Toronto is off until Tuesday, when they travel to face the Cleveland Cavaliers.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 117-96 at Philips Arena on Saturday. 

This was expected to be a blowout in the Hawks favor and they didn't let up against a weak Sixers team. The second and fourth quarters is when Atlanta made their mark, as they outscored Philadelphia 66-39 in that 24-minute stretch The Hawks shot over 50 percent from the field and recorded 31 assists on their 48 made baskets. They also outrebounded the Sixers 52-39 and also outscored them in the paint 50-34. 

Philadelphia (1-8) is coming off their first win of the season on Friday and they simply didn't have enough juice to get that elusive second win in a tough situation. Jahlil Okafor got the start after resting on Friday, as he led the team with 18 points and six rebounds in 23 minutes of action. Sergio Rodriguez was second on the team, as he accumulated 13 points, three rebounds and four assists. Dario Saric and Nik Stauskas finished with 12 points apiece. Robert Covington was the only other player in double figures, scoring 11 points and swiping four steals. The Sixers will have another road game on Monday against the Houston Rockets for their next fixture. 

Atlanta (7-2) continues to get it done and wins like this are par for the course. Tim Hardaway Jr. led the team in scoring, as he scored 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting off the bench. Kent Bazemore led the starters in scoring, with his 18 points, five rebounds and three steals on 8-of-13 shooting. Dwight Howard recorded another double-double, totaling 10 points and 11 rebounds. Point guard Dennis Schroeder amassed 16 points, five rebounds and eight assists in the win. Atlanta has a few days off before they play the Miami Heat on the road for their next game.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Washington Wizards 106-95 at United Center on Saturday. 

The Wizards came into this game extremely shorthanded and it was simply too much to overcome. While they held the lead for the majority of the first half, Chicago responded by running away late. A 9-0 run at the end of the third quarter is when it really opened up, as it was tied before that. Both teams really struggled shooting, as the Wizards shot 42 percent to the Bulls' 40 percent. Free-throw shooting carried Chicago, as they went 23-of-25 in the win. Fastbreak points was a huge difference as well, with the Bulls scoring 22 fastbreak points to the Wizards six. 

Washington (2-7) had to play this game without John Wall and Bradley Beal, which was simply too much production to overcome. Markieff Morris did all he could though, leading the team with 24 points and 15 rebounds. Marcin Gortat also recorded a double-double, totaling 18 points and 14 rebounds. Sheldon McClellan and Tomas Satoransky filled-in for Wall and Beal, combining for 27 points, six rebounds and 10 assists in pleasantly surprising performances. Washington will be off until Wednesday, when they take on the Philadelphia 76ers in a much needed favorable matchup. 

Chicago (6-4) has now won three of their last four after losing three-straight, so it appears they've steadied the ship. Jimmy Butler had one of the best games of his career, accumulating 37 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in the win. Robin Lopez finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds, despite going 5-of-16 from the field. Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade struggled with their shots as well, combining for 14 points on 5-of-23 shooting. Nikola Mirotic was huge off the bench, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 boards en route to a double-double. Chicago's next game will be on Tuesday, when they travel to play the Portland Trail Blazers.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the host Houston Rockets 106-100 at Toyota Center on Saturday.

In a rematch from earlier this week, the Spurs avenged a rare home loss by beating the Rockets here in their home building. San Antonio played very efficiently, as they shot 41-of-76 to go 54 percent from the field, while the Rockets went just 34-of-89 to shoot 38 percent from the field. Houston lived beyond the arc, as they went 15-of-47 from three-point range in the defeat. That led to San Antonio dominating in the paint, as they won that battle 48-34. 

The Spurs (7-3) are now 5-0 on the road this season and they continue to win with elite defense. Kawhi Leonard led the team in scoring, dropping 20 points on 9-of-16 shooting. LaMarcus Aldridge recorded a double-double, totaling 16 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. Pau Gasol built off his best game of the year on Friday, by accumulating 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Tony Parker had his best game all season as well, scoring 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting. The Spurs will host the Miami Heat on Monday for their next game.

The Rockets (5-4) planned to win this game through pace, but it led to some inefficiencies on the offensive end. While they took 13 more shots than the Spurs, they made seven less baskets. James Harden added to his MVP-type numbers though, as he tallied 25 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists en route to a triple-double. Eric Gordon led the team in scoring, dropping 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting off the bench. Clint Capela totaled 12 points and 10 rebounds of his own. Ryan Anderson struggled mightily, as he scored six points on 1-of-13 shooting. Houston returns to action on Monday in a favorable home matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves 119-105 at Target Center on Saturday.

These are two teams headed in opposite directions and this result shows just where they're headed. The Clippers were in control for the majority of the game, as there were only four ties and six lead changes. Los Angeles actually led for the entirety of the second half, as Minnesota never led by more than two points in the first half. The Clippers shot lights-out hitting 53 percent fro the field and 46 percent from three-point range. Los Angeles also took advantage of the whistle, going 28-of-37 from the free-throw line, with Minnesota taking just 21 free-throw attempts. 

The Clippers (9-1) are the hottest team in the NBA right now and they used a different recipe to win this one. All five starters were great, as they each scored 15 or more points in the win. Blake Griffin led the team, totaling 20 points, 11 rebounds and four assists. Chris Paul wasn't far behind, finishing with 19 points, four rebounds and eight assists. DeAndre Jordan posted a monster double-double, scoring 18 points and grabbing 16 rebounds. The big man also went an efficient 10-of-16 from the free-throw line. The Clippers look likely to continue this success, as they host the Brooklyn Nets for their next game on Monday.  

The Timberwolves (2-6) have been one of the biggest disappointments this season and it's a wonder when they'll pull out of this hole. Ricky Rubio did return from an elbow injury in this game, as he accumulated seven points, six rebounds and six assists in the loss. Karl-Anthony Towns led the team in scoring, totaling 24 points, 10 rebounds, two blocks and two steals. Andrew Wiggins went just 8-of-24 from the field, but still scored 22 points. Zach LaVine was the only other player in double figures, accruing 15 points, three rebounds and four assists.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the host Miami Heat 102-91 at American Airlines Center on Saturday. 

Utah is the far superior team coming into this matchup and they showed that by leading for over 45 minutes of this game. They actually led by 21 at times and held the Heat at bay all evening long. Free-throw shooting was the biggest difference, with Utah going 16-of-19, while Miami went just 10-of-19. The Jazz shot 49 percent in their win and committed just nine turnovers. Strangely, the Heat dominated the assisting margin, as they recorded 21 dimes to the Jazz' 12.  

Utah (7-4) continues to ride their defense to wins, but they may have suffered a bigger loss in this victory. Derrick Favors recently returned from a knee injury, but he had to leave this game after five minutes due to renewed knee soreness. Gordon Hayward stepped up in his absence though, leading the team with 25 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Rodney Hood was second on the team, with his 17 points and four rebounds. Rudy Gobert recorded another double-double, totaling 12 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. Dante Exum and Joe Johnson finished with 10 a piece in the win. The Jazz will look to keep it rolling on Monday, when they host the Memphis Grizzlies for their next game. 

Miami (2-6) has really struggled recently and a battle against Utah's defense certainly wasn't the cure. Hassan Whiteside played well though, totaling 15 points, 14 rebounds and two blocks in the defeat. Justise Winslow grabbed 11 points and six rebounds of his own. The bench was big for Miami, as James Johnson, Derrick Williams and Rodney McGruder all scored in double figures. More importantly, Josh Richardson played a season-high 32 minutes and took a season-high 16 shots, finishing with 12 points, three rebounds and four assists. Things don't get any easier for Miami either, as they travel to play the San Antonio Spurs on Monday for their next game.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 106-96 at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Saturday. 

In a battle between two defensive-minded teams, the Milwaukee offense played as well as they have all season. The Bucks actually shot 53 percent from the field and held the Grizzlies to just 45 percent on their end. Three-point shooting killed Memphis, as they went 6-of-30, while Milwaukee went 7-of-19. The Bucks dominated the points in the paint as well, scoring 50 to the Grizzlies' 38. Milwaukee actually led for the majority of this game, with Memphis never leading by more than one point.

Memphis (4-5) have now lost three of four and one has to wonder if they have enough offense to make the playoffs. Marc Gasol ran the offense tonight through the post, as he tallied 18 points, five rebounds and six assists. Vince Carter was second on the team, as he scored a season-high 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Mike Conley finished the game with 15 points, five rebounds and three assists. Zach Randolph and Chandler Parsons were the only other Grizzlies in double figures, as they scored 12 a piece. Memphis will look to bounce back on Monday when they travel to Salt Lake City to play the Utah Jazz. 

Milwaukee (5-4) is quietly playing some great ball and it's the shoulders of Giannis Antetokounmpo whose carrying them there. Antetokounmpo stuffed the stat sheet in this win, accumulating 27 points, six rebounds, five assists, four steals and four blocks. Jabari Parker was the only other starter in double figures, amassing 16 points and four rebounds of his own. Michael Beasley had his best game in a Bucks uniform, scoring 19 points off the bench on 6-of-8 shooting. Milwaukee will look to remain above .500, as they travel to play the Atlanta Hawks for their next game on Wednesday.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the Denver Nuggets, 106-95, at Pepsi Center on Saturday.

A truly balanced offensive attack, superior ball security and stingy defense are a winning combination more often than not, and such was the case for the Pistons (5-5) on Saturday. All five members of Detroit's starting five tallied double-digit scoring, and super-reserve Jon Leuer pitched in off the bench with a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double as well. The Pistons also committed only nine turnovers while eliciting 15 from the Nuggets (3-6), and tallied a stellar 51.1 percent success rate from the field. The visitors also built themselves a cushion early, winning the first quarter by a 36-21 margin that would serve them well the rest of the way.

Tobias Harris posted 19 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block to lead the Pistons. Marcus Morris chipped in with 17 points, three assists, a rebound and two steals. Andre Drummond and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope supplied a pair of 14-point efforts, with the former also hauling in 12 rebounds and recording two steals and the latter posting a rebound, and a pair of assists and steals apiece. Ish Smith rounded out the strong night for the starting five with 10 points, eight assists, three rebounds and two steals.

The Nuggets were spearheaded by Emmanuel Mudiay's 19 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Danilo Gallinari registered 18 points, four rebounds and an assist. Gary Harris compiled 13 points, four boards and four assists. Jusuf Nurkic was notably held scoreless over 17 minutes, while Kenneth Faried collected eight points, eight rebounds, an assist and a pair of blocks. Jameer Nelson paced the bench with an 11-point effort. 

The Pistons head back home to face off with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night, while the Nuggets head to Portland for a tussle with the Trail Blazers on Sunday.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 122-104, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Saturday. 

The Nets (4-5) came in as a better offensive team that had been imagined back in preseason, yet nevertheless still in search of their first road victory. A balanced offensive effort not only led to their first win away from the Barclays Center, but to a season-high point total as well. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who posted a personal season-best 20 points, led the way, and also pulled in 13 rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block. Six other players, three starters and three reserves, also posted double-digit scoring, leading the way to success rates of 47.6 percent from the field and 43.2 percent from three-point range.

Trevor Booker poured in 19 points and added eight rebounds, four assists and a block. Sean Kilpatrick matched Booker's point total and complemented it with nine rebounds, four assists and a steal. Brook Lopez had a rather rare opportunity to take a step back offensively, posting a modest 11 points, five rebounds, two assists, five blocks and a steal. Joe Harris paced the bench with a 19-point effort of his own, while Luis Scola was also a strong contributor off the bench with 10 points, five rebounds and a block. 

The Suns (3-7) were spearheaded by T.J. Warren, who managed 18 points, three rebounds, two assists, three steals and a block. Marquese Chriss put together the best game of his young career, tallying 16 points, five rebounds and a steal in just 18 minutes. The rookie big man with the deft shooting touch impressively drained seven of 15 field-goal attempts, including two of four three-point tries. Devin Booker supplied 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and a steal. Alex Len contributed a 10-point, 11-rebound double-double, while Jared Dudley paced the bench with 17 points, six rebounds and two assists. 

The Nets head to Los Angeles for a Monday night date with the Clippers, while the Suns face off with the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.

However, their second consecutive foray into an extra period against Indiana went much better, culminating in Philadelphia's first victory of the season. Joel Embiid led the way by playing a game-high 26 minutes and posting 25 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a block. While he shot just 33 percent (6-of-18) from the field, he successfully parlayed 12 of 14 visits to the free-throw line into points. The impressive third-year man helped spearhead a sizable advantage for the Sixers down low, as they outrebounded the Pacers by a 54-40 margin. 

Indiana was led by Paul George, who despite leaving the game in the first half temporarily with a left thumb sprain, totaled 26 points, nine rebounds, four assists and two steals. Monta Ellis was actually second in line despite coming off the bench, amassing 19 points, six rebounds, five assists and four steals over 36 minutes. C.J. Miles, who drew the start at shooting guard, turned in 13 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal. Jeff Teague was modestly involved on offense over 35 minutes, supplying 13 points, four assists, a rebound and three steals. Thaddeus Young had a near double-double with 11 points, nine boards, an assist and a steal. Myles Turner supplied only five points, five rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block over 21 minutes, but Al Jefferson chipped in with 10 points, three boards and two assists over 22 minutes.

Philadelphia also saw Gerald Henderson compile 12 points, four rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Robert Covington checked in with 10 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Ersan Ilyasova and Nik Stauskas paced the bench with a pair of 14-point efforts, with the former also bringing in 11 rebounds, two assists and a block, while the latter also dished out an assist and recorded a block. 

The Pacers head back home to tangle with the Boston Celtics on Saturday night, while the Sixers now head to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Saturday evening as well.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Washington Wizards 105-94 at Verizon Center on Friday. 

These are two teams going in opposite directions and this result shows exactly which direction. Despite Washington leading for the majority of the first half, Cleveland pulled away by holding the lead for the final 25 minutes. Three-point shooting really let the Wizards down, as they went 3-of-15, while the Cavaliers went 14-of-33. Aside from that, most statistics were fairly even. In fact, they tied in turnovers, assists and fouls, while coming within one rebound of one another. 

Cleveland (7-1) is off to one of their best starts in franchise history and LeBron James continues to fill up the record books. James finished this game with 27 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, while becoming the fastest player in NBA history to reach 27,000 points. Kyrie Irving led the team in scoring, dropping 29 points and six assists on 11-of-23 shooting.  Kevin Love recorded a double-double, totaling 14 points and 16 rebounds. J.R. Smith was the only other Cavalier in double figures, scoring 17 points in the win. On deck for Cleveland is a home matchup against the surging Charlotte Hornets on Sunday. 

Washington (2-6) has been one of the disappointments of the season and a game like this is the last thing they needed. John Wall did all he could though, as he accumulated 28 points, three assists and two steals. Markieff Morris was second on the team, with his 20 points and five boards. Marcin Gortat scored just four points, but grabbed 15 rebounds in the defeat. Otto Porter provided 11 points, eight rebounds and five assists of his own. Washington will look to start digging out of this hole on Saturday, as they travel to play the Chicago Bulls for their next game.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Charlotte Hornets 113-111 at Spectrum Center on Friday. 

There aren't many teams in the Eastern Conference playing up to the standards of the Hornets and Raptors and they left it all on the floor on Friday. While there were only four ties and five lead changes, there were some serious swings. In fact, the Raptors won the second quarter 30-17, with the Hornets firing back with a 38-21 third quarter. Charlotte actually led this game 91-81 with nine minutes left, but Toronto responded with a 28-11 run over the next seven-plus minutes to pull away. Defense was key for the Raptors, as they held the Hornets to 41 percent from the field. In addition, they won the turnover battle 12-5 and the steal differential 8-1.  

The Raptors (6-2) continue to fly under the radar and they may have pulled out their biggest win of the season against the Hornets here. DeMar DeRozan continued his torrid scoring, as he led the team with 34 points, three rebounds and three assists. Kyle Lowry was second on the team, as he tallied 19 points, eight rebounds and six assists. DeMarre Carroll, Jonas Valanciunas, Cory Joseph and Lucas Nogueira all scored between 10 and 12 in the Raptors win. Toronto will return to action on Saturday, as they host the New York Knicks for their next game. 

The Hornets (6-2) got some great efforts from their stud players, but fell just short when it mattered the most. Kemba Walker didn't let up though, as he scored a season-high 40 points on 12-of-19 shooting. Walker also provided 10 rebounds and six assists with his 40-spot in the defeat. Nicolas Batum recorded a double-double as well, totaling 18 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Marvin Williams finished the game with 10 points and 13 rebounds of his own. It doesn't get any easier for the Hornets, as they travel to play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday for their next game.

												The Orlando Magic fell to the visiting Utah Jazz 87-74 on Friday night at Amway Center.

The Magic (3-6) led by four after three quarters but only scored 10 points in the fourth quarter while the Jazz (6-4) surged ahead with 27 in the quarter. 

Gordon Hayward has led the Jazz in scoring each game since his return to action on Nov. 6, resulting in three wins in four games for Utah. Their wins all came against sub-.500 teams but nonetheless they have been looking good. Hayward led the way for Utah in this one, finishing with 20 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, in 39 minutes while Derrick Favors followed up with 18 points and nine rebounds in 36 minutes, the most he has played in a game this season. Rudy Gobert stood his ground versus the Orlando bigs, finishing with 13 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks. The Jazz struggled shooting from distance going 7-of-28 but were able to make-up for it on the defensive end. Meanwhile, George Hill missed his third-straight game with a thumb injury. 

This marks the third loss in a row for the Magic, who have been struggling to find ways to score. They average less than 95 points per game and tried to shake things up by inserting Jeff Green into the starting lineup in place of Aaron Gordon, however it did not make much difference as Orlando still came up short, finishing with only 74 in this one. Orlando hit only 33 percent of its shots and only managed 13 assists, in contrast to 12 turnovers, as their offensive lagged. Evan Fournier led the way with 21 points and D.J. Augustin added 19 off the bench, but only two other players scored more than five points for the Magic. 

Next up for the Magic is a trip Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder on Sunday. The Jazz will be in Miami on Saturday for the second of a back-to-back.

												The Boston Celtics dominated the visiting New York Knicks, 115-87, on Friday night at TD Garden. 

It was a physical game right from the start, which worked out in favor of Boston, as Carmelo Anthony was ejected from the game in the second quarter for arguing a foul call after a tussle between him and Amir Johnson.

Isaiah Thomas was huge for Boston (4-4) as he led the way offensively with 29 points on 9-of-17 shooting, in only 28 minutes. Thomas went 3-of-5 from deep, while the Celtics were great from downtown overall, hitting 11-of-27. They shot only 39 percent from the field overall but made up for it with vicious defense, forcing 25 turnovers from the Knicks. Kelly Olynyk was solid in his second game back, with 19 points on 6-of-11 shooting, seven rebounds and three assists, in 30 minutes. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart both filled the stat sheet. Smart finished with 12 points, 10 assists, six rebounds and three steals, while Bradley notched 15 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and four steals. The Celtics move to 3-1 at home and will head out for a two-game road trip beginning in Indiana on Saturday.

With this loss the Knicks (3-5) fall to 1-3 on the road and have not achieved consecutive wins once yet this season. They were coming off a good win in Brooklyn but failed to carry that momentum into this one, which may have had something to do with the fact that Carmelo Anthony was ejected mid-second quarter. Anthony scored 12 points in 12 minutes before losing his temper. Kristaps Porzingis was the high-point man with 14 points, along with six rebounds and two blocks, in 23 minutes. Derrick Rose added 11 points, six assists and four rebounds, while the only other player to tally double-digits for the Knicks was Justin Holiday, with 10. The Knicks can only look ahead, where they have to bring their best effort to Toronto for their second game in as many nights Saturday.

												The visiting Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Oklahoma City Thunder, 110-108, in a nail-biter on Friday.

The Clippers (8-1) maintained their league-best record with the narrow win over the Thunder.  Through nine games, the Clippers have now seen only one loss: a two-point defeat by the Thunder.  Dominant bench play has contributed largely to Los Angeles's success, and was on full display on Friday.  Reigning Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford scored 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting, including three three-pointers.  Fellow bench guard Austin Rivers also contributed seven points on efficient shooting.  Forward Blake Griffin, meanwhile, started and led the team with 25 points.  All-Star point guard Chris Paul posted a double-double, scoring 17 and dishing out 10 assists.

The Thunder (6-3), on the other hand, have started to slow after a surprising hot start.  Point guard Russell Westbrook, however, is still running at full speed.  Westbrook came just one assist from a triple-double on Friday, scoring 29 points and pulling down 14 rebounds.  It was a strong night for most of the Thunder starting five, as rookie Domantas Sabonis scored 12 points on 4-of-5 shooting, with all four field goals coming from three-point range.  Guard Victor Oladipo also delivered a solid performance with 18 points.  The Thunder were able to keep the score close but trailed for much of the fourth quarter, ultimately forcing up a wild shot to attempt to win the game at the buzzer.

The Clippers will visit the Timberwolves on Saturday, while the Thunder will host the Magic on Sunday.

												The host San Antonio Spurs defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 96-86, on Friday night.

The win came as a much-needed momentum-changer for the Spurs (6-3), who had lost three of their previous four games.  Strong second-half play helped feed the turnaround win, as the Spurs came out and outscored Detroit by 11 in the third quarter.  Big man Pau Gasol, a first-year member of the Spurs, led the way for the team with 21 points.  Reigning Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard also helped to bring home the win for the Spurs.  Despite shooting just 5-of-18, Leonard scored 17 points and came away with four steals.  Big man LaMarcus Aldridge posted 12 rebounds, meanwhile, helping San Antonio to earn a slight advantage in the rebounding column on the night.  The Spurs were able to out-rebound the Pistons despite the play of Detroit center Andre Drummond, the league's leading rebounder.  Drummond had 17 rebounds on the night.

The rebounding column wasn't the only place where Drummond contributed, as he also led the Pistons (4-5) with 20 points.  Detroit is still suffering from the absence of injured point guard Reggie Jackson, although backup Ish Smith has been able  to make an impact in his absence.  Smith scored 12 points on efficient shooting and committed just one turnover in 30 minutes of play.  The loss helped to highlight Detroit's struggles on the road so far this season, as the Pistons fell to 0-5 away from home.  Detroit has won every game played at the Palace of Auburn Hills this season, but attempts to win a road outing still remain fruitless.

The Pistons will remain on the road on Saturday as they visit Denver, while San Antonio will travel to Houston.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the visiting Sacramento Kings, 122-120, in overtime on Friday.

The dynamic backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum was vital to the Blazers' (6-4) victory, as the guards each scored over 30 points on the night.  Lillard scored 36 to go with a team-high seven assists, while McCollum added four steals to his 31 points.  Strong perimeter play helped push Portland over the top, as the Blazers hit 13 threes while allowing just six for the Kings.  The starting Sacramento backcourt of Ty Lawson and Aaron Afflalo struggled, combining for just 15 points.  Blazers wing Allen Crabbe, the recent recipient of a max contract, provided a major boost off the bench for Portland, scoring 16 points to go with seven rebounds and four assists.  The game remained close throughout, with Portland unable to establish a secure lead until the final seconds of overtime.

For Sacramento (4-7), All-Star big man DeMarcus Cousins exploited the thin Portland frontcourt, scoring a team-high 33 points.  Forward Rudy Gay was not far behind, scoring 29 points and pulling down 14 rebounds.  Sacramento was able to make up for disadvantages in perimeter shooting and overall field goal percentage by out-rebounding Portland 48-36.  Despite the dominance of Sacramento's frontcourt, strong overtime play from Portland's guards tipped the game in the Blazers' favor.

Portland will host the Denver Nuggets on Sunday, while Sacramento will enjoy a long three-day rest.

												The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 112-106, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Thursday. 

The Pelicans checked in to Thursday with an 0-8 record, with half of those defeats having come on the road. Despite their struggles, Anthony Davis had opened the season on a tear, with four games of over 30 points. It was therefore fitting that the All-Star forward led New Orleans (1-8) to their first win, pacing them with 32 points and adding eight rebounds, two assists, four blocks and two steals. His last two points of the night were the most important, as he sank two free throws with 12 seconds remaining to seal the win. He was supported by double-digit scoring performances from three other members of the starting five, as well as a collective 30 points from the bench.

E'Twaun Moore was second behind Davis with 20 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal. Tim Frazier posted a 15-point, 10-assist double-double, along with five rebounds and a steal. Terrance Jones supplied 10 points, seven rebounds and a block. Buddy Hield paced the bench with nine points, four rebounds and a steal. Solomon Hill and Omer Asik registered a pair of eight-point efforts in reserve roles as well.

The Bucks (4-4) were led by a game-and-season-high 33 points from Jabari Parker, and added nine rebounds, an assist, a block and a steal. Giannis Antetokounmpo posted a 17-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two blocks, an assist and a steal. Malcolm Brodgon registered 10 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal to lead the reserves.

New Orleans heads back home and will try for their second win against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night, while Milwaukee remains home for their own Saturday night tussle with the Memphis Grizzlies.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Miami Heat 98-95 at American Airlines Arena on Thursday. 

In a battle between two Eastern Conference mainstays, there wasn't a whole lot to separate these two squads. There were actually 14 ties and 19 lead changes in this tightly contested battle, with no team leading by more than eight points. The key for Chicago was the free-throw shooting, as they went 18-of-20, while Miami went just 10-of-15. Three-point shooting kept the Heat hanging around, as they went 13-of-29, with the Bulls hitting just 6-of-16.

Chicago (5-4) came into this losing four of five, but they showed some resiliency in an important road win. Six of the nine players who took the floor for the Bulls scored in double figures. Jimmy Butler led the team, with his 20 points, four rebounds, five assists and three steals. Rajon Rondo had one of his best games in a Chicago uniform, tallying 16 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. Robin Lopez also finished with 16, adding nine boards as well. Dwyane Wade shot just 5-of-17 against his former team, but finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and four assists. The Bulls will host the Washington Wizards for their next game on Saturday. 

Miami (2-5) has gotten off to a rough start, but this was a great performance despite the loss. Hassan Whiteside carried the load, as he finished with 20 points and 20 rebounds in a dominating performance. Dion Waiters and Josh Richardson were second on the team, as they scored 16 a piece. Justise Winslow accumulated 15 points, five rebounds, six assists and four steals. Goran Dragic struggled and left early due to an ankle injury, finishing with six points and four assists in just 22 minutes of play. Miami returns to action on Saturday, when they host the Utah Jazz for their next game.

												The visiting Golden State Warriors crushed the Denver Nuggets on their home floor on Thursday, 125-101.

For the first-time in 72 games, the Warriors' (7-2) Kevin Durant failed to score 20 or more points.  The snapped streak comes just a day after Durant tied Michael Jordan for the third-longest 20-point game streak in NBA history.  It was far from an off night for Durant, however, as he posted 18 points, nine rebounds, and five assists on the night while shooting 8-of-16 from the field.  It was reigning MVP Steph Curry, however, who stole the show, scoring a team-high 33 points while hitting seven three-pointers on the night.  The Warriors' offense was firing on all cylinders on Thursday, as the team recorded 33 assists and shot over 54 percent from the field.  Strong shooting helped the team hop out to a 38-19 lead by the end of the first quarter, a lead that they only build on throughout the remainder of the game.

The Nuggets (3-4), meanwhile, struggled mightily from the floor.  The team shot just over 36 percent from the field and only 70 percent from the free-throw line.  Rookie guard Jamal Murray led the team with 14 points off the bench, despite shooting just 5-of-15 from the field.  Sophomore Emmanuel Mudiay fared even worse despite a career night earlier in the week against Boston.  Mudiay hit just 4-of-15 on field goal attempts on Thursday.  Denver's inability to find the basket made their early deficit almost insurmountable.

The Nuggets will host the Pistons on Saturday, while the Warriors will host the Suns on Sunday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings 101-91 at Golden 1 Center on Thursday. 

The Lakers (5-4) were down by 19 points with 4:54 left in the second quarter after Anthony Tolliver buried a 25-foot three point jumper, but the narrative did not stay the same for the Kings (4-6) on their home court. Through nine games, the Lakers captured their fifth win of the season, which took them until late December to get to that total last season. Luke Walton's system is working, especially for the shooters like Nick Young and Lou Williams. Both players were instrumental in leading the second half comeback, as Young grabbed 13 of his 16 points in the second half. 

Sacramento, on the other hand, went through a long scoring drought in the third quarter, and simply did not get many calls under the rim. DeMarcus Cousins found some life in the fourth quarter after getting some rest, but it was too little too late for the Kings to mount a comeback. Cousins finished with 28 points, nine rebounds, four assists and two steals on 10-of-25 shooting, but only got to the free throw line eight times. Rudy Gay and Ty Lawson finished in double figures for the starters alongside Cousins, but the inefficient bench shooting sunk the Kings while the Lakers got the hot hand. 

Los Angeles turned to their bench, specifically Lou Williams. The ex-sixth man of the year went off for 21 points on 12 shots in 23 minutes of action. Williams driving layup with 8:40 left in the fourth quarter and three pointer made with 4:52 left in that same final period kept the Kings just out of reach, and came in clutch moments to help the starters. Julius Randle was defensively impressive, especially in transition, including a big block on DeMarcus Cousins. Both Kentucky products were jawing at each other by the end of the game. Randle pitched in an all around game with 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists. 

Next up, the Kings visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, while the Lakers visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 110-96, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. 

Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis have formed quite an effective duo on several occasions already this season, with Wednesday's victory serving as the latest example. Anthony rattled off his sixth straight 20-point-plus performance, while Porzingis joined him in eclipsing that total for the third consecutive contest. Overall, the Knicks (3-4) had five players tally double-digit scoring and shot a solid 47.8 percent from the field overall on their way to evening their home record at 2-2.

In contrast, the Nets (3-5) could only muster one double-digit scoring effort from their starting five, which unsurprisingly came from Brook Lopez. The veteran big man posted 21 points, four rebounds, an assist and three blocks. The other four members of the first unit contributed full but modest stat lines. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson pitched in with eight points, five rebounds, four assists and a block. Sean Kilpatrick, getting the start for Isaiah Whitehead (concussion) at point guard, mustered seven points, five assists and four rebounds. Bojan Bogdanovic provided six points, two rebounds, two assists and three steals, while Trevor Booker rounded things out with five points, six boards, two assists and three steals. 

Anthony's 22 points led the way for New York, a scoring total he supplemented with seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Porzingis was right behind him with a 21-point, eight-rebound outing that also included an assist, two steals and two blocks. The backcourt duo of Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee were able to take a more secondary role on the night due to the success up front. They did combine for 27 points on 11-of-22 shooting, along with six rebounds and five assists. Second-year man Willy Hernangomez, seeing his first game action in four contests, led the bench with 14 points, six rebounds, two blocks and a steal. 

The Nets head out west to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Saturday night, while the Knicks travel to Boston for a Friday night date with the Celtics.

												The host Charlotte Hornets defeated the Utah Jazz 104-98 at Spectrum Center on Wednesday. 

In a battle between two defensive-minded teams, there wasn't much to differentiate the two in the box score. Both teams went exactly 38-of-82 from the field and they both hit eight three-pointers in the tightly contested battle. The key for Charlotte was their bench, as they got 41 points from their four bench players to the 20 points from Utah's five bench players. There were 10 lead changes and eight ties, as the Hornets pulled away late. Utah actually led this game for over 30 minutes, but the beginning of the first quarter and end of the fourth helped Charlotte escape with a win. A 12-3 run in the middle of the fourth is when the Hornets put their stamp on their win.

Utah (5-4) continues to play well, but they couldn't quite pull out a road upset against one of the best teams in the league here. Gordon Hayward played great yet again, as he led the team with 29 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Rodney Hood was second on the team, with his 20 points, four rebounds and four assists. Derrick Favors recorded a double-double, as he totaled 16 points and 10 rebounds in a season-high 34 minutes. Utah will travel to Orlando on Friday to face the Magic for their next game. 

Charlotte (6-1) is establishing themselves as an elite team right now and wins like this only improve their stock. Kemba Walker carried the load, as he accumulated 21 points, five rebounds, six assists and four steals in the win. Marvin Williams fell two rebounds shy of a double-double with his 19 points and eight boards. Marco Belinelli, Frank Kaminsky and Spencer Hawes each scored in double figures off the bench, as they combined for 36 points. The Hornets will look to keep things rolling on Friday, as they host the Toronto Raptors for their next game.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Boston Celtics, 118-93, at Verizon Center on Wednesday.

The Wizards (2-5) completely overwhelmed the Celtics (3-4) out of the gate, exploding for 34 points over the first 12 minutes. That stretch included a 16-0 run within the period that sprung them to an 18-2 lead by the 6:26 mark of the first quarter. Otto Porter spearheaded the Wizards' attack with a season-high 34 points, which he complemented with 14 rebounds, four assists, three steals and three blocks. As their final point total would indicate, Washington enjoyed a strong shooting night, tallying a 50 percent success rate from the field, as well as 47.6 percent from behind the arc.

The Celtics were paced by Isaiah Thomas, who posted 23 points, 10 assists and six rebounds. Backcourt mate Avery Bradley was next, supplying 21 points, three rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Amir Johnson was the only other starter that got into double digits in the scoring column, compiling 11 points, three rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Marcus Smart led the bench with 20 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal.

John Wall checked in behind Porter with 19 points, seven assists, three rebounds, a steal and a block. Marcin Gortat managed 13 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Bradley Beal registered only three points in 11 minutes on 1-for-8 shooting before exiting with tightness in his right hamstring. The comfortable lead and Beal's absence opened up extra minutes off the bench for Marcus Thornton and Trey Burke, who contributed 16 and 18 points, respectively. 

The Celtics head back home to face the Knicks on Friday night, while the Wizards remain home to face the Cavaliers in a Friday evening tussle.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Orlando Magic, 123-107, at Amway Center on Wednesday.

Despite their subpar record coming in to the contest, the Timberwolves (2-5) have increasingly felt optimistic about the immediate and distant future due to their young core of Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine and Karl-Anthony Towns. While all have exhibited the inconsistent play typical of young players at times, they've certainly flashed the considerable upside each brings to the table. Wiggins put together such an effort Tuesday, totaling 36 points against the Nets in a loss. It was LaVine's turn Wednesday, as he posted a season-high 37 points that led Minnesota's charge, and complemented the scoring total with four rebounds, three assists and a steal. His point tally partly consisted of a stellar 7-of-9 performance from three-point range. Wiggins and Towns combined for another 49 points, and the Timberwolves finished with 51.7 and 56.5 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, while only committing six turnovers. 

Wiggins' full stat line consisted of 29 points, six assists and four rebounds. Towns put together a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included an assist, two steals and a block. Gorgui Dieng contributed a 12-point 11-rebound double-double of his own, along with seven assists, two steals and a block. With rookie Kris Dunn once again struggling in a start at point guard (two points in 17 minutes), Tyus Jones received 31 minutes off the bench and managed 10 points, five assists, four rebounds and a pair of steals. Shabazz Muhammad paced the reserves with 13 points.

The Magic (3-5) weren't exactly offensive wallflowers themselves, but simply couldn't keep up with their visitors' firepower. They were led by a 24-point effort from Nikola Vucevic, who also had 14 boards, six assists and a block. Elfrid Payton was next with 18 points, seven assists, three rebounds and a steal. Evan Fournier supplied 13 points on 4-of-11 shooting, while Serge Ibaka finished with 11 points, two rebounds and two blocks. Mario Hezonja and D.J. Augustin were both factors off the bench, notching 11 and 10 points, respectively. 

The Timberwolves head back home to take on the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night, while the Magic remain home to face the visiting Utah Jazz on Friday evening.

												The host Indiana Pacers held off the Philadelphia 76ers for a 122-115 overtime win at Banker Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday. 

The Pacers came into this game as a double-digit favorite, but narrowly pulled out a win against the winless Sixers. It was tight throughout, as there were 15 lead changes and seven ties. Shooting was key for the Pacers, as they outshot the Sixers from the field, from three-point range and from the free-throw line. Indiana actually shot 54 percent from the field and 47 percent from long distance. The Pacers also won the turnover battle and scored more points in the paint than the Sixers. 

Philadelphia (0-7) has yet to get a win, but they showed some fight here as a bug underdog. Dario Saric had the best game of his young career, as he double-doubled in a 14-point, 12-rebound outing. Robert Covington led the team in scoring, as he scored a season-high 23 points on 8-of-16 shooting. Gerald Henderson provided 17 points and five rebounds of his own. Hollis Thompson was a great spark off the bench, scoring 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting.  

Indiana (4-4) is now a perfect 4-0 at home, but this one was far from easy. Jeff Teague had his best game in a Pacer uniform, as he led the team with 30 points and nine assists. Paul George wasn't far behind, as he accumulated 28 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Myles Turner was the only other starter in double figures, as he totaled 15 points and nine rebounds. Al Jefferson led the bench, as he dropped 18 points and six rebounds on 9-of-12 shooting. 

These two teams have a rematch for their next game as they play in Philly on Friday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Chicago Bulls 115-107 at Phillips Arena on Wednesday. 

The Hawks (6-2) had their full starting lineup back on Wednesday after Kyle Korver (personal) missed their victory over the undefeated Cavaliers on Tuesday. However, it was not the starters that carried this Atlanta team to their third straight victory. Rather, it was the excellent play of their bench that held off the reeling Bulls. Of the five players that saw time off the bench for the Hawks, four of them scored in double figures with Thabo Sefolosha's season-high 20 points leading not just the reserves, but the entire team. As a unit, the reserves scored 54 of the team's 115 points. For the starters, the frontcourt consisting of Paul Millsap and Dwight Howard each had a double-double and combined to record 34 points and 21 rebounds. 

The Bulls (4-4), on the other hand, have now lost four of their last five games after starting the season 3-0. On Wednesday, Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade absolutely torched the Hawks. Their Chicago teammates, however, did not. Butler finished with a game-high 39 points, seven assists, four rebounds and six steals, while Wade scored 25 points managed five steals of his own. So, while Butler and Wade combined the score 64, the rest of the team managed to score a lowly 43 points with the next highest scoring total being Taj Gibson's 43. And despite the hot shooting nights form Butler and Wade, the team still managed to shoot just 45 percent from the field.

Up next, the Hawks will stay home to take on the 76ers on Saturday, while the Bulls look to get back on track against the Heat on Thursday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 112-102 Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday. 

The Raptors (5-2) did not get off to a hot start in this contest, allowing the Thunder (6-2) to go on a 12-0 run in the first four and half minutes of the game. Toronto, however, kept their composure and continued to whittle away at the lead from there, ultimately snagging a seven-point lead by halftime. They never lost that lead, as the play of their All-Star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan proved to be too much for the Thunder to handle. Lowry nearly had a triple-double, recording 19 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds in an astonishing 43 minutes, while DeRozan continues to be the league's top scorer, as he posted 37 points Wednesday — his sixth 30-point performance in seven games. 

For the Thunder, they lost their first home game of the season despite another stat-stuffing performance from Russell Westbrook, who recorded 36 points, seven rebounds and seven assists on the night. The problem for Westbrook, however, is that he shot just 9-of-26 from the field, 3-of-12 from behind the arc and committed eight turnovers, leading to an overall sloppy performance from the All-Star point guard.  Beyond Westbrook, just Victor Oladipo and Steven Adams managed to score in double figures, with 18 and 14 points respectively, but Adams did add 12 rebounds, giving him his second double-double of the season.

Up next, the Raptors will hit the road once again on Friday to play the Hornets, while the Thunder will stay home to take on the Clippers on Friday.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Detroit Pistons 107-100 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Wednesday. 

The Suns (3-6) survived a bit of a scare late in Wednesday's game, as after holding the lead throughout the third quarter, they gave up a 14-0 run that bled into the final period and they were down as much as six points. Phoenix then came roaring back to take a five-point lead with five minutes remaining, and that was a lead they never lost. Eric Bledsoe nearly had a triple-double on the evening, recording a team-high 21 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in 35 minutes. Meanwhile, T.J. Warren continues to make a run at being the NBA's most improved player, scoring 18 points — the fourth time in five games he has done so. Additionally, Jared Dudley was tremendous off the bench, scoring 19 points while shooting 6-of-9 from the field and 4-of-6 from behind the arc. 

The Pistons (4-4) have now lost three of their last four games, as they continues to have consistency issues on both sides of the ball. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the team in scoring, notching a game-high 27 points on 9-of-22 shooting from the field, while Andre Drummond recorded his third straight double-double and his sixth of the season, as he posted 18 points and 14 rebounds. As a team, despite being in the game until the very end, the Pistons shot a lowly 36 percent (32-of-89) from the field. 

Up next, the Suns will stay home to take on the Nets on Saturday, while the Pistons will head to San Antonio on Friday to play the Spurs.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the San Antonio Spurs 101-99 at AT&T Center on Wednesday. 

The Rockets (5-3) narrowly came away with a two point victory against a relatively banged up Spurs (5-3) team. James Harden's triple-double led the way, however, Kawhi Leonard fell a layup short of tying the game on the final possession. With 2:08 left in the fourth quarter, Ryan Anderson buried a 26-foot three pointer to take a 101-97 lead. Leonard went on to make a midrange jumper to bring the Spurs within two points, but on the last play with time expiring, the San Antonio forward missed a driving layup to tie the game. 

It was still a strong performance from Leonard, who went on to score 34 points, to go along with seven rebounds, one assist and two blocks. James Harden rounded out the box score with another explosive performance, as the Rockets point guard finished with 24 points, 15 assists, 12 rebounds and one steal. Worth noting is Harden's eight turnovers, which matched his season high on the year. Ryan Anderson was lethal from behind the arc, burying four three pointers on his way to 20 points in 36 minutes. 

Tony Parker (knee) will return to the court on Friday and is still dealing with right knee soreness. 

The Rockets host the Spurs on Saturday, while the Spurs sandwich a game with the Detroit Pistons at home before the rematch.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 111-80 at Staple Center on Wednesday. 

The matchup was never close. The Clippers (7-1) took a 20 points lead at the end of the first quarter and simply built upon the Blazers (5-4) shooters being unable to bury a shot from the low post, to the midrange and behind the arc. It was not a particularly spectacular defensive effort by Los Angeles, rather the matchup advantage of Chris Paul on Damian Lillard. The Blazers point guard was ice cold, as he finished just 1-of-10 from the field and 0-of-4 from three point territory. The rest of the Portland team was unable to bail out the rough performance from Lillard, as C.J. McCollum and Maurice Harkless matched their starting point guard with eight points in the loss.

Los Angeles, on the other hand, did not need any form of expert shooting to build upon an early lead, but did turn in effective performances from their starters. Blake Griffin led the way for Los Angeles, as he finished with 22 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block on 7-of-14 shooting. Chris Paul added 19 points and seven assists, while J.J. Reddick scored 10 points on 3-of-5 shooting. The bench was once again led by Marreese Speights, who contributed 12 points, eight rebounds and an assist in the win. 

Next up, the Clippers visit the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday, while the Blazers will return home the same day to host the Sacramento Kings.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 116-95, at Oracle Arena on Wednesday. 

The Warriors (6-2) improved to 3-1 on their home court with an easy win against the Mavericks (2-6), but Stephen Curry turned his ankle which silenced the crowd for a minute. Curry was taped up and did return to action rather quickly, as the Warriors rolled through all quarters, save for a minor slump in the third period. Golden State built upon a 34-15 lead at the end of the first quarter to take a very comfortable 67-36 lead into the half. Klay Thompson was the standout performance given his rough start to the season, and awoke to the tune of 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting. 

The Mavericks (2-6) were short handed in the tough matchup with Golden State on the road, as J.J. Barea (late scratch), Wesley Matthews (rest) and Andrew Bogut (rest) were sidelined. The Mavericks were playing the second game of a back-to-back, so the strategic rest early in the season did cause them to fall four games below the .500 mark. However, wins against the Warriors team that boasts Kevin Durant, Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green simply do not come easy. Harrison Barnes continued his strong scoring trend with 25 points, to go along with eight rebounds and one assist. Seth Curry matched up against his brother, but was not as effective from deep, as he finished with 10 points on 2-of-9 shooting from three point land.

Next up, the Warriors visit the Denver Nuggets, while the Mavericks enjoy some time off before visiting the New York Knicks on Monday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 110-106, at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday.

The reigning NBA champs came into Tuesday as the league's last undefeated team, with four of their victories having come at home. However, Atlanta (5-2) came into the game sporting one of the NBA's stingiest defenses, having allowed the sixth-least points per game. Something was likely to give, and surprisingly, it was Cleveland's (6-1) unblemished mark. The Hawks got standout efforts from Dennis Schroder, Kent Bazemore and Paul Millsap, while Dwight Howard also hauled in 17 rebounds. Bazemore drilled a key jumper with 6.8 seconds remaining to help seal the win and cap off a stellar 50.6 percent shooting night for Atlanta. 

Schroder's season-high 28 points led the Hawks, which he complemented with six assists and two rebounds. Bazemore totaled 25 points, six rebounds and three assists, and drained four of his six three-point attempts. Millsap pitched in 21 points, five boards and an assist, while Howard added seven points, two assists and three blocks. Mike Muscala paced the bench with 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block. 

The Cavs were led by Kyrie Irving's game-high 29 points, which he needed a whopping 27 shot attempts to get to. He also posted four assists, a rebound, a steal and a block. Kevin Love continued his stretch of excellent early-season play, supplying 24 points, 12 rebounds, three assists and two steals. LeBron James registered a typically full stat line of 23 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three steals. Channing Frye led the reserves with 13 points, seven rebounds and an assist.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 119-110, at Barclays Center on Tuesday. 

The Timberwolves (1-5) came in to Tuesday's contest having played solid defense through their first five games, allowing only 100.4 points per game, while the Nets (3-4) had been much more generous, allowing 107.3 points per contest. However, the roles were somewhat reversed Tuesday, with Brooklyn tallying a season-high 119 points on the strength of outstanding 55.3 percent shooting. Six players also managed to hit double digits in the scoring column, allowing them to overcome 20 turnovers and a season-high 36 points from Andrew Wiggins to secure their third victory of the season, which have all come at home.

Wiggins complemented his scoring total, which came on 29 shot attempts, with eight rebounds, two assists and a steal. Karl-Anthony Towns was next with 21 points, seven rebounds, four assists and a block. Zach LaVine managed 17 points, two boards and an assist, while Kris Dunn was notably held scoreless and only contributed three rebounds, two assists and a steal over 16 minutes. However, Tyus Jones received a season-high 32 minutes with Dunn struggling and led the bench with 12 points, seven assists, five rebounds and five steals.

The Nets were led by Brook Lopez, who won the battle down low with Towns by turning in 26 points, three rebounds, an assist and three blocks. Trevor Booker supplemented his efforts in the frontcourt with 15 points, nine boards, an assist, three steals and a block. Bojan Bogdanovic and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson contributed a pair of 13-point efforts, with the former adding two assists, a rebound and a steal, while the latter registered four boards and a pair of assists. Sean Kilpatrick continued to excel off the bench, leading the reserves with 14 points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal. 

Minnesota heads down to Central Florida with a Wednesday night tussle with the Orlando Magic, while Brooklyn tangles with their inter-city rival New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday evening as well.

												The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Denver Nuggets at the buzzer on Tuesday, 108-107, at FedExForum. 

For the Grizzlies (4-4), it was Marc Gasol who had the game-winning tip-in with just 0.7 seconds remaining on the clock. Memphis was lucky to be in that position, however, as that shot came off a steal with just over four seconds remaining and Denver seeming to have the game firmly in their grasp. After Denver's Emmanuel Mudiay tipped the ball out of bounds from Mike Conley's hands, all it took was a simple lob pass to Gasol from the baseline to steal a victory on Tuesday night. In the end, Gasol had a solid outing, recording 19 points and six rebounds in 30 minutes, but it was the veteran Vince Carter who led the way, scoring a team-high 20 points off the bench. 

For the Nuggets (3-3), it was another impressive outing for Mudiay, who scored a game-high 23 points along with seven assists and four rebounds in 36 minutes. Danilo Gallinari added 21 points of his own, while the other three Denver starters each recorded double-digit nights in the scoring column as well. It wasn't enough however, as just 25 points from the Nuggets' bench didn't do them any favors as they fell short in the final seconds on Tuesday. 

Up next, the Grizzlies will have off until Saturday when they travel to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks, while the Nuggets will head home Saturday to play Golden State.

												The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Phoenix Suns 124-121 at Moda Center on Wednesday. 

Despite the Blazers pulling out a rare wire-to-wire win, this game was close throughout. The Suns trailed by one with just five seconds left, but the Blazers closed things out with some clutch free throws. Portland was lights-out with their jumpers, shooting 56 percent from the field and 45 percent from three-point range. Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum carried the load, as they combined for 71 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the win.

Phoenix (2-6) has gotten off to a rough start this season, but they continue to hang around in every game. After back-to-back career-high nights, Devin Booker settled for 23 points on 8-of-18 shooting in the defeat. Eric Bledsoe was Phoenix's best player, totaling 31 points, four rebounds and four assists, with 15 of those points coming in the fourth quarter. Four bench players scored in double figures, as Dragan Bender, Brandon Knight, P.J. Tucker and Leandro Barbosa combined for 42 points. Tucker was very important off the bench, accumulating 11 points, nine rebounds, four assists and five steals. The Suns play again on Wednesday, when they host the Detroit Pistons for their next game.

Portland (5-3) were expected to dominate this game, but it was closer than fans would hope. Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum did everything they could though, as they each scored 30-plus in dominating performances. Lillard led the team with 38 points, five rebounds and three assists.  McCollum wasn't far behind, as he tallied 33 points, six rebounds and seven assists of his own. Maurice Harkless was third on the team, with 20 points and six boards. Al-Farouq Aminu played just four minutes before exiting with a calf injury in the first quarter. Portland will look to build off this win against the surging Los Angles Clippers on Wednesday.

												The Dallas Mavericks defeated the host Los Angles Lakers 109-97 at Staples Center on Tuesday.

In a game that was tight throughout, the veteran Mavericks team prevailed in the final minutes. Dallas actually finished the game on a 20-6 run over the final eight minutes, as Los Angles seemingly couldn't make a shot. The Mavericks won nearly every statistic, as they led in shooting, assisting, steals, blocks and turnovers. The most notable margin was the shooting, as the Mavericks shot 52 percent from the field and 87 percent from the free-throw line. 

Dallas (2-5) have gotten off to a rough start this season with some injury troubles, but were able to pull out a big road win here. Dirk Nowitzki and Deron Williams are both dealing with injuries, so J.J. Barea and Harrison Barnes have really stepped up in their absence. Barea flirted with a triple-double in this win, totaling 18 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. Barnes led the team in scoring, dropping 31 points on 11-of-18 shooting. Justin Anderson, Dwight Powell and Seth Curry were the only three players to come off the bench, as they each provided at least 10 points and four rebounds. Curry was especially good, amassing 23 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals. Dallas has a tough task ahead of them though, as they travel to play the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday for their next game. 

The Lakers (4-4) were undefeated in their home building coming into this, but folded late in the fourth quarter. Jordan Clarkson led the team in scoring, as he totaled 22 points and three steals off the bench. Nick Young led all starters, as he dropped 20 points on 7-of-12 shooting. Julius Randle recorded a double-double, tallying 15 points and 10 rebounds. D'Angelo Russell too just nine shots in the defeat, but still finished with 12 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Los Angeles will make a small traveling trip for their next game, as they play the Sacramento Kings on Thursday.

												The host Sacramento Kings defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, 102-94.

Neither team was able to convincingly pull away, with Sacramento (4-5) holding a single-digit lead heading into the final minute of the game.  This has been somewhat of a theme for New Orleans (0-8), who has played many teams closely this season but has yet to record a win.  For Sacramento, the key seemed to be feeding All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins, who led the squad with 28 points despite an off night on the glass.  High-scoring wing Rudy Gay also turned in a solid performance, posting 21 points, six assists, and six rebounds.  Overall, Sacramento was able to out-shoot their opponents from deep, hitting eight three-pointers on the night.

For the Pelicans, Tuesday was yet another disappointing result in what has been a string of losses to start the season.  In sticking with the trend, it was also a big night for star forward Anthony Davis, who led the team and the game with 34 points.  Davis also made his presence felt on defense with two steals and four blocks.  Only two other Pelicans cracked double-digits, however, with three of the starting five combining for just 15 points on the night.

The Pelicans will visit Milwaukee on Thursday, while the Kings will host the Lakers.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 109-84, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday.

The Jazz (5-3) learned earlier in the day that standout point guard George Hill would miss the game with the sprained thumb that has been bothering him for the last couple of days, leaving Shelvin Mack and Dante Exum to soak up most of the minutes in his stead. Given that the veteran had gotten his Utah tenure off to a highly productive start, his absence could have left an offensive void, particularly on the road. However, the remainder of the squad, led by Gordon Hayward in only his second game back from a preseason finger injury, made up for Hill's production with a stellar shooting night. The Jazz posted success rates of 50.6 and 57.9 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively, leading to a comfortable victory.

Hayward tallied 20 points, seven rebounds, five assists and a steal, giving him at least 20 in the scoring column in both of his first two games back on the court. Rodney Hood was next with 18 points, two rebounds, an assist and a steal. Derrick Favors, playing a season-high 29 minutes, exploded for a 16-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included an assist, a steal and three blocks. Mack and Exum combined for 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting, with the latter's point total pacing the reserves.

The Sixers (0-6) saw their big men lead the way in scoring, no small feat against the Jazz frontcourt. Jahlil Okafor, who ceded the start to Joel Embiid, actually paced Philadelphia with 15 points, and he complemented the scoring with four rebounds, an assist and a block. Embiid followed with a near double-double of 14 points, nine boards, a steal and a block. Robert Covington contributed 12 points, eight rebounds and an assist, with the scoring total representing a season high. Ersan Ilyasova supplied 10 points, three rebounds and two assists, his third time with double-digit scoring in as many games with the Sixers.

The Jazz continue on to Charlotte for a date with the  Hornets on Wednesday, while the Sixers head to Indiana to face the Pacers in their own Wednesday night tilt.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the host Washington Wizards 114-106 at Verizon Center on Monday. 

The game was tight throughout, as neither team led by more than 11 points while the lead changed hands 25 times. The Wizards held a 95-94 advantage with 6:45 left, but the Rockets used a 12-0 run to put it out of reach with just a few minutes left. Shooting was the big difference, as Houston shot 52 percent, while holding Washington to just 42 percent on their end. The Rockets played efficiently as well, as they assisted on 28 of their 41 made baskets. 

The Rockets (4-3) continue to blitz opponents with their up-tempo offense, and the Wizards simply couldn't keep up with them. James Harden led the team with 32 points, 15 assists and six rebounds. Ryan Anderson had one of his best games in a Houston uniform, recording a season-high 23 points and seven boards on 9-of-15 shooting. Trevor Ariza provided 15 points, five rebounds and three steals of his own. The Rockets return to action on Wednesday, when they travel to San Antonio to face the Spurs.

The Wizards (1-5) continue to be one of the disappointments of the league, as they melted down in their own building. John Wall led the team in scoring with his 21 points, five rebounds and eight assists, but picked up his second technical in the final minute of the game to get ejected. Bradley Beal had one of his best games of the year, totaling 20 points, three assists and four steals in the defeat. Marcin Gortat recorded a double-double, amassing 14 points and 12 rebounds. Otto Porter tallied 20 points, eight rebounds and three steals. Washington will look to play better on Wednesday, when they host the Boston Celtics.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Indiana Pacers, 122-100, at Spectrum Center on Monday. 

The Hornets (5-1) improved their sterling start to the season with a blowout win against the strong conference opponent in the Pacers (3-4). The win extends Charlotte's streak to three games, but they did suffer a setback after Michael Kidd-Gilchrist left the game twice with back soreness. Kidd-Gilchrist returned to the floor after halftime, but his back flared up again and he'll now be questionable heading into Wednesday's contest against the Jazz. 

While the injury did not help the Hornets, it also had little impact on the outcome. Cody Zeller and Marvin Williams had the hot hand in the first quarter, as they both powered their team to an early 18-point lead with 6:30 remaining in the first quarter. Paul George and C.J. Miles aided the Pacers in cutting that lead to nine points by the end of the first quarter, but Charlotte got back into their groove after pulling away by another 18-point margin halfway through the second quarter. The story remained the same for the second half, as the Hornets spread the ball, and the scoring efforts, across nine different players. 

The Hornets saw nine players scoring in double figures on Monday, with Kemba Walker leading the way. The Charlotte point guard finished with 24 points, 10 assists, two rebounds, two steals and one block in an all around fantastic performance that included 7-of-11 shooting from the field. Walker buried five three pointers in the win to go along with his game leading stats. Before exiting, Kidd-Gilchrist was a perfect 4-of-4 from the field with 13 points, one board and one assist, while Marvin Williams and Cody Zeller pitched in with a combined 25 points and nine rebounds. 

The Pacers (3-4) simply could not get enough offense moving to match the Hornets pace, and have yet to pick up a win on the road. Paul George finished with 10 points, six assists and seven rebounds, while C.J. Miles had a standout performance off the bench with 23 points in 25 minutes. 

Both teams play at home on Wednesday, as the Pacers host the Philadelphia 76ers, while the Hornets welcome the Utah Jazz.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the Orlando Magic 112-80 at United Center on Monday. 

The Bulls' (4-3) second-half defense propelled them toward a blowout win at home over the Magic (3-4). The contest was close in the first half, with Orlando keeping themselves within striking distance of the Chicago lead. Evan Fournier and Aaron Gordon led the Magic in the second quarter after falling behind early, and they entered the half with a nine-point deficit. The second half was a different story, however, as the Magic posted just 11 points in the third quarter and 17 points in the final period. Chicago was able to pull away with relative ease after Orlando went scoreless from the 10:12 mark to the 5:13 mark in the third quarter.

While shooting inside the arc went swimmingly for the Bulls, who hit 47.2 percent of their attempts from the field as a unit, three-point shooting did not go nearly as well. Chicago shot just 15.8 percent from behind the arc on 3-of-19 shooting. The three point shooting was going surprisingly well up until Monday, given the trio of Rajon Rondo, Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade's career marks not being among the elite in the NBA. Butler led the way for Chicago and finished with 20 points, seven assists and five rebounds, while Wade added 16 points, four assists and three boards. 

Gordon finished with 15 points for the Magic, to go along with four assists and four rebounds. The bench was of little help to the starters, as Mario Hezonja's nine points led the reserves. Orlando shot just 38.8 percent from the field as a team, and the long scoring drought in the third quarter proved to be all the Bulls needed to come away with a win.

Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Bulls travel to Atlanta to take on the Hawks, while the Magic return home to host the Minnesota Timberwolves.

												The host Oklahoma City Thunder beat the visiting Miami Heat, 97-85, on Monday.

The Thunder (6-1) now sit atop the Western Conference as they continue their scorching-hot start to the season.  Despite preseason projections expecting a major drop-off for OKC following Kevin Durant's signing with the rival Golden State Warriors, the Thunder have looked dominant through the first two weeks of the season.  On Monday, the team continued the trend, getting off to a quick start with a 39-point first quarter.  While Miami was able to whittle the double-digit lead down a bit, OKC came out even stronger in the third quarter, going on a 20-0 run to take control of the game.  All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook scored or assisted on all 20 points during the run.

The Heat (2-4), meanwhile, are playing more or less as projected, holding a sub-.500 record following the departure of Dwyane Wade and the likely end of Chris Bosh's playing career.  Miami's starting five struggled badly, combining for just 35 points on the night.  Center Hassan Whiteside scored just five points, though he did manage a team-high 12 rebounds.  Rebounding was not enough, however, as the team fell flat on the offensive end, shooting just 36 percent from the field.

The Thunder will host the Raptors on Thursday, while the Heat will return to Miami to host the Bulls on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Detroit Pistons 114-82 at Staples Center on Monday.

The Clippers (6-1) continued what has been a dominant start to the regular season, earning what was not only their sixth win of the season, but their sixth win by double-digit points. Along with that, Chris Paul continues to be very effective as the team's floor leader, notching 24 points, eight assists and six rebounds despite not playing a single minute in the fourth quarter, as the Clippers dominated the Pistons from start to finish. Paul is now averaging 19.3 points, 8.6 assists and 6.0 rebounds despite only playing 30 minutes per game to start the year. Additionally, after getting off to a rough start of the season, J.J. Redick notched his first 20-point game of the season, as he hit 3-of-4 shots from behind the arc and 6-of-9 from the field overall. As a team, the Clippers shot a scorching 52 percent from long range. 

For the Pistons (4-3), there wasn't much to be excited about, as Andre Drummond was their leading scorer on the night with just 15 points on top of 12 rebounds. In fact, given how poorly the team played, Detroit's reserves ended up outscoring their starts 42-40 with Jon Leuer leading the way for the bench mob by recording 14 points and six rebounds in 29 minutes. The Pistons, after winning three of their first four regular season games, have now dropped two of their last three while their offensive continues to be hot and cold. 

Up next, Detroit will travel to Phoenix on Wednesday to take on the Suns, while the Clippers will stay at home to play the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 116-106, at Oracle Arena on Monday. 

For the Warriors (5-2), it was all about Stephen Curry. The two-time MVP broke his own single-game record for three-pointers made in a game with 13 on just 17 attempts. Overall, he finished the night shooting 16-of-26 from the field for a game-high 46 points as Golden State managed to pull away in the closing minutes. Curry's heroics were necessary too, as after a strong first half from Golden State, the Pelicans came roaring back in the third quarter to even take a lead at one point. But there was no stopping the Warriors in the final period. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson finished with 22 and 24 points of their own, respectively, and were the only other players to score in double figures for Golden State. 

For the winless Pelicans (0-7), they were once again led by their superstar power forward Anthony Davis, who recorded 33 points and 13 rebounds on the night but was nearly shut out in the final period when New Orleans needed him the most. Golden State made an effort to collapse on Davis whenever he had the ball inside, and that led to just six points in the fourth quarter,  four of which came when the game was out of reach. Other than Davis, the only other Pelicans players to score in double figures were E'Twaun Moore and Tim Frazier, who scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, as the starting backcourt for New Orleans. 

Up next, the Warriors will remain at home to take on the Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will attempt to earn their first win of the season against the Kings on Tuesday.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the New York Knicks, 114-109, at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.

The Jazz (4-3) braced themselves for an offensive void when they lost Gordon Hayward to a finger injury in preseason , as he was slated to miss a minimum of six weeks. However, the standout forward beat the recovery timetable by at least two weeks, starting at the three on Sunday for Utah. He looked as if he hadn't missed a beat, rattling off a team-high 28 points, along with five rebounds. While he only found the net on six of his 17 field-goal attempts, he impressively drained all 14 of his shots from the free-throw line. His effort spearheaded a highly productive day for the Jazz offense that saw all five members of the first unit hit double-digit scoring and Utah produce a collective 50.7 percent success rate from the field.  

George Hill, who's helped pick up a good bit of the offensive slack in Hayward's absence, continued to thrive despite the latter's return to the court, totaling 23 points, six rebounds, four assists and a steal. Rodney Hood was right behind with 18 points, six rebounds, four assists and a steal. Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors turned in a pair of 13-point efforts from the frontcourt, with the former also contributing eight rebounds, an assist, three blocks and a steal, and the latter supplying six boards. Joe Johnson, who headed to the bench with Hayward's return, tallied 10 points to pace the bench. 

The Knicks (2-4) were co-led by a pair of 28-point outputs for Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis. Anthony also registered nine rebounds and three assists, while Porzingis supplied eight boards, an assist and two blocks. Derrick Rose continued his strong stretch of play to open his tenure in the Big Apple, totaling 18 points, eight assists, four rebounds and a steal. Courtney Lee was the fourth member of the starting five to hit double digits in the scoring column, posting 10 points, six boards and three steals.

The Jazz continue their trek through the Northeast with a Monday night visit to Philadelphia to face the Sixers, while the Knicks remain home to tangle with the inter-city rival Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday evening.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 100-94, at FedEx Forum on Sunday.

Typically, it's Damian Lillard who spearheads the Blazers' attack, frequently leading Portland (4-3) in both field-goal attempts and scoring. However, it was backcourt mate C.J. McCollum who took the mantle Sunday, putting up more than double the shots of Lillard and leading all scorers with a season-high 37 points. The third-year shooting guard added four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block over a team-high 39 minutes. McCollum also drained half of his 12 three-point attempts on the afternoon, after having made the same amount in the last three games combined. Overall, Portland's solid shooting (45.1 and 42.4 percent marks from the field and three-point range, respectively) and a 24-point fourth quarter helped secure the team's third road win in four tries.

Lillard contributed 19 points, seven assists, six rebounds and a steal. He was only 3-of-11 from the field, but did convert all 11 free-throw opportunities. Maurice Harkless was next with 18 points, seven rebounds, two blocks and a steal. Al-Farouq Aminu and Mason Plumlee were modest contributors, with respective eight- and seven-point tallies, while also combining for 11 boards down low.

The Grizzlies (3-4) were led by Marc Gasol, who went for 21 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Mike Conley supplied 16 points, seven assists, four rebounds, two steals and two blocks. The veteran guard made only one of five three-point tries, but it was memorable, as it came at the buzzer to end the first half. Tony Allen registered 11 points, seven boards and four steals. Zach Randolph was typically productive off the bench, leading the reserves with 15 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Vince Carter was solid in a reserve role as well, providing 11 points, five rebounds, an assist and a steal. 

The Blazers head back home to face off with the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night, while the Grizzlies remain home for their own Tuesday evening tangle with the Denver Nuggets.

												The Sacramento Kings were able to score a road victory Sunday over the Toronto Raptors, knocking off the defending Eastern Conference runner-ups 96-91 at the Air Canada Centre.

Recent results would indicate an easy Raptors win, but that simply wasn't the case. This game was tight throughout, as no team led by more than 11 points. Toronto actually led for a 30-minute stretch in this game, but the Kings hung around and pulled out the upset win. The key for Sacramento was their defense, as they held Toronto to 36 percent shooting from the field and 23 percent shooting from three-point range. The Kings also dominated down low, limiting the Raptors to 30 paint points, while scoring 52 on their end. 

The Kings (3-5) have been struggling recently, so a road win like this may change their fortunes going forward. Rudy Gay wasn't expected to suit up for this game with a rib injury, but ended up suiting up while scoring a team-high 23 points against his former squad. DeMarcus Cousins was second on the team in scoring, tallying 22 points to go with 15 rebounds, four assists and three blocks in the win. Ty Lawson scored just five points on 0-of-6 shooting, but handed out 11 dimes in the victory. Kosta Koufos and Arron Afflalo both scored in double figures for the first time this year as well. Sacramento will return to action on Tuesday, when they host the winless New Orleans Pelicans.

Toronto (5-2) looked as dominant as anyone coming into this game, but left Sunday looking very beatable. DeMar DeRozan failed to reach 30 points for the first time all season, as he dropped 23 on 7-of-20 shooting in the loss. Kyle Lowry was the only other player with more than 10 points, finishing the contest with 15 points, 10 assists and four rebounds. Patrick Patterson was a nice spark off the bench, as he amassed six points, nine rebounds and two blocks. On deck for the Raptors is a road matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday.

												The host Dallas Mavericks won their first game of the season on Sunday, beating the Milwaukee Bucks 86-75 in overtime.

It was a low-scoring affair for both sides, due in large part to cold perimeter shooting from both teams.  For Dallas (1-5), the vast majority of the team's scoring came from guard J.J. Barea and forward Harrison Barnes, who scored a combined 55 points on the night.  While Barnes hit half his shot attempts and Barea shot a respectable 8-of-18 from the floor with a pair of three-pointers, the Mavericks hit just 37.5 percent of their attempts from the floor.  Shooting guard Wesley Matthews was particularly shaky from the field, hitting just 3-of-17 from the field on the night.  The lead flipped back and forth throughout, with stagnant offense making it difficult for either team to establish a significant lead.  Dallas finally appeared to get things going in overtime, however, as they were able to outscore Milwaukee 12-1 in the extra period.

For Milwaukee (4-3), shooting was an equally significant struggle, as the team hit just 36.6 percent of its shots from the floor with only six three-pointers made. Point-forward Giannis Antetokounmpo had his quietest night of the season going just 4-of-12 from the field for only 11 points.  It was a promising night for third-year forward Jabari Parker, however.  The former second overall pick had 16 points and seven rebounds while hitting half his shot attempts.

The Mavericks will visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while Milwaukee will have a long break before facing the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday.

												The Denver Nuggets annihilated the host Boston Celtics on their home court, 123-107.

Denver (3-3) came out strong, finishing the first quarter with a 42-23 lead.  Sophomore point guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who had been struggling, scored 24 points in the first quarter alone, while shooting 9-of-10 from the field.  Mudiay finished with a career-high 30 points, also grabbing eight rebounds.  Denver entered the game with the highest rebounding differential of any team (+11.5), and continued the trend, holding a 47-39 advantage on the boards.  Guard Gary Harris also returned to the starting lineup, scoring 12 points on 5-of-10 shooting.

Boston (3-3), meanwhile, has been dealing with the injury bug early in the season.  Free agent acquisition Al Horford, as well as starter Jae Crowder and backup center Kelly Olynyk, were sidelined in Sunday's contest.  All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas stepped it up in his teammates' absence, scoring 30 points on the night.  However, the rest of the team struggled, particularly on the defensive end.  Denver was able to convert on 52 percent of its shots from the field on Sunday.

The Nuggets will visit Memphis on Tuesday, while the Celtics will see Washington on Wednesday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Phoenix Suns, 119-108, at Staples Center on Sunday.

The Lakers (4-3) notched their third straight win and remain undefeated at home after another strong performance by their young, talented core. Los Angeles built upon an eight-point first quarter lead in the second period, where a series of scoring runs capped off the first half.

The Suns made the game a heated contest in the fourth quarter. Devin Booker buried a 10-foot jump shot with 6:39 left in the final period and drew a foul, sinking a free throw to pull the game within one point. The Lakers were able to outlast the Phoenix comeback attempt and did not let up their lead, even after it dwindled to just one possession. Nick Young and D'Angelo Russell nailed much needed back-to-back three pointers to put the game out of reach and secure the rest of the victory from the charity stripe.

Devin Booker had a standout performance, as his sophomore season continues where he left off from his rookie year. Booker finished with 39 points, seven assists and three rebounds on 13-of-29 shooting. T.J. Warren added 22 points, while Eric Bledsoe finished with 19 points, two assists and two boards.

Nick Young provided his best game of the young season with 22 points and seven rebounds, in addition to three buckets from behind the arc. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams were impressive off the bench, adding a combined 32 points on 13-of-28 shooting in 26 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. Julius Randle had the most well-rounded game for the Lakers on his way to 18 points, five rebounds, four assists and one steal.

Both teams play on Tuesday, as the Lakers look for their fourth straight win hosting the Dallas Mavericks, while the Suns head north to take on the Portland Trail Blazers.

Although the focal point of the Thunder's (1-4) offense is usually located square at the point guard position, the team's big men are certainly capable of impressively contributing in their own right. That facet was on full display Saturday, as Steven Adams and Enes Kanter combined for 34 points and 18 boards, helping to set the tone down low. Coupled with Russell Westbrook's typically stellar output, Oklahoma City (5-1) posted an excellent 52.3 percent success rate from the field, as well as 43.8 percent from behind the arc, notably superior to the Timberwolves' respective 39.3 and 21.1 percent figures in those categories.

The Timberwolves' starting five was decidedly top-heavy in terms of production, as Karl-Anthony Towns led the way with a game-high 33 points, which he supplemented with six rebounds and a block. He had little precious little help, however, as no other starter managed to even get into double digits on the scoring column. Gorgui Dieng struggled offensively for the second straight game, finishing with just eight points along with eight boards and four blocks. Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine were particularly underwhelming, totaling just seven and four points, respectively, on a combined 4-of-19 shooting tally. Shabazz Muhammed led the bench with 15 points and four rebounds.

Westbrook led the Thunder with 28 points, eight assists, six rebounds and three steals. Adams contributed 14 points, eight boards, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Victor Oladipo posted 12 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal, while Kanter paced the bench with a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included an assist, a steal and a block. 

Minnesota has three days to get their act together, as they next take the court against the Brooklyn Nets in New York on Tuesday. The Thunder remain home to take on the Miami Heat on Monday night.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 102-101, at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday. 

The Cavaliers (6-0) looked fully in control following a 34-point outburst in the first quarter, which gave them a seemingly comfortable 15-point lead. However, the winless Sixers (0-5) impressively chipped away, outscoring Cleveland by a 61-48 margin over the second and third periods. That set up a photo finish in the final 12 minutes, one that saw an Iman Shumpert steal of Gerald Henderson save the day for the visitors as time expired. Prior to that, a clutch three-pointer by Channing Frye with 1:05 remaining gave Cleveland the 102-101 lead. Neither team was able to find the basket after that point, setting the stage for Shumpert's heroics. 

LeBron James led the Cavs with 25 points, 14 assists, eight rebounds and two steals. Kevin Love was next with a double-double of his own, tallying 20 points, 11 boards, an assist and a block. Tristan Thompson provided a typically modest point total of seven points but added 13 rebounds and recorded a pair of stuffs. J.R. Smith totaled 11 points, a rebound, an assist, three steals and a block. Frye paced the bench with 12 points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal. 

Joel Embiid continued his stretch of excellent early-season play, posting a season-high 22 points and adding six rebounds, two assists, four blocks and a steal over 25 minutes. Henderson was the only other Philadelphia player to manage double-digit scoring, compiling 11 points, two rebounds, an assist and two steals. Sergio Rodriguez managed only seven points but did dish out 11 assists, brought down six boards and recorded a pair of steals. Ersan Ilyasova paced the bench with 21 points and four rebounds, a tally that included 4-of-6 shooting from behind the arc. 

The Cavaliers return home to face off with the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday, while the Sixers remain home to tangle with the Utah Jazz on Monday.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards, 88-86, at Amway Center on Saturday.

A strong fourth quarter by Orlando (3-3) helped them overcome a sluggish night on offense that saw the Magic shoot just 39.7 percent from the field. Both teams checked in well below their scoring averages, with the Wizards (1-4) managing a 39.5 percent success rate on their 86 shot attempts, and a total of only five players in the game posting double-digit scoring. A pair of 18-point efforts served as each team's high score, with Markieff Morris reaching the mark for the visitors and Jeff Green doing it for the Magic off the bench.

Morris added eight rebounds, three assists and two blocks to his aforementioned scoring total, but missed a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. Bradley Beal supplied 15 points, three rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block. Otto Porter posted a 10-point, 13-rebound double-double, while Marcin Gortat complemented his eight-point output with 14 boards, two assists and a steal. Tomas Satoransky, starting at point guard for the resting John Wall, registered eight points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal. 

Green's season-high 18 points were supplemented by five rebounds, three assists and a block. Evan Fournier tallied 13 points, two rebounds and two assists, but shot only 2-of-8 from the field. Serge Ibaka joined him in double digits, amassing 11 points while also hauling in seven rebounds. The normally productive trio of Elfrid Payton, Aaron Gordon and Nicola Vucevic underwhelmed, however, posting a combined 21 points on 8-of-21 shooting.

The Wizards head back home to take on the Houston Rockets on Monday night, while the Magic hit the road to take on the Bulls in Chicago on Monday evening as well.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the visiting Denver Nuggets 103-86, Saturday night at The Palace of Auburn Hills.

The Pistons are off to a fantastic start this season in terms of defending their home court, where they stand 4-0. The Pistons (4-2) shot 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from long range en-route to the 19-point victory. They had a bit of trouble as they gave up 14 turnovers but were able to force 16 out of the Nuggets to earn the advantage in that category. Andre Drummond went to work, finishing with 19 points, 20 rebounds, in 34 minutes and also notched his 500th career block, finishing with three blocks in the game. Marcus Morris chipped in 15 points, while John Leuer was solid off the bench, with 15 points of his own. The Pistons' bench accounted for 36 points on the evening and provided the boost they needed to pull away from the Nuggets. 

Denver came into this game well rested after a solid win versus the Timberwolves but were met with an unforgiving challenge from the Pistons. The Nuggets (2-3) were held to 31 percent shooting in the first half and did not see much improvement in the second half as they finished the game shooting only 33 percent from the field. Wilson Chandler was the high-point man for the Nuggets, as he finished with 21 points and nine rebounds, in 31 minutes off the bench. Jusuf Nurkic notched a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds, in 24 minutes, while Jamal Murray finished with nine points and two assists as a starter. On the plus-side Gary Harris and Darrell Arthur both returned to the line up after missing multiple games. 

Next up the Pistons visit Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers on Monday, while the Nuggets will face-off against the Celtics on Sunday for their second game in as many nights.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the Chicago Bulls 111-94 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday. 

In a game between two Eastern Conference contenders, the Pacers looked like the far superior team in a wire-to-wire win. Indiana got off to a hot start, as they took a 40-19 lead early in the second quarter. Chicago played better after that, but the deficit was simply too large to overcome, as they seemingly couldn't get the margin within single-digits after that. The assist-to-turnover ratio was the difference, as the Pacers recorded 27 assists to their 11 turnovers, while the Bulls handed out just 17 assists to their 16 turnovers. The Pacers shot 54 percent from the field, while holding the Bulls to just 43 percent on their end. 

Chicago (3-3) got off to a great start with three-straight wins, but have regressed to lose their last three games. Jimmy Butler was the lone starter to play well, as he totaled 16 points, two rebounds and two assists on 5-of-7 shooting. Bobby Portis was a bright spot in the blowout loss, as he tied the team lead with 16 points off the bench, with most of that coming in garbage time. Taj Gibson fell one point shy of a double-double, accumulating nine points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. Dwyane Wade struggled mightily, as he scored just four points on 1-of-9 shooting. 

Indiana (3-3) came into this game losing three of four, but this result never seemed to be in doubt after the first quarter. Jeff Teague had his best game in a Pacer uniform, scoring a team-high 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting with six dimes in the win. Paul George tallied 13 points, seven rebounds and three assists before being ejected in the third quarter for kicking the ball into the stands. C.J. Miles was great off the bench, scoring 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the visiting Houston Rockets 112-97, Saturday night at Philips Arena. 

The Hawks (4-2) put together their highest scoring first half of the young season, with 65 points in the first 24 minutes. Through 48 minutes they shot 53 percent from the field and 40 percent from deep, while holding the Rockets to 43 percent from the field. Atlanta dominated inside, with 62 points in the paint, in large part thanks to Dwight Howard and Paul Millsap, who combined for 43 points. Howard was huge against his former team, finishing with 20 points, 14 rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal, in 29 minutes. Millsap added 23 points, 11 rebounds, five steals, and four assists, in 34 minutes. Kent Bazemore had his best game so far this season, with 20 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals, in 32 minutes. The Hawks are now 3-1 at home but will have their work cut-out for them as they enter Cleveland to face the defending champs on Tuesday. 

The Rockets (3-3) started out well but began to unravel in the second half, where they were out-scored 47-38. They were held to 13 free throw attempts, which is almost as many as James Harden is capable of earning on his own on any average night. Harden continued his strong point-guard play, with 30 points, 12 assists, nine rebounds and three steals, in 37 minutes. Harden did not have a ton of offensive support as the next highest scorer for Houston was K.J. McDaniels, who added 13 points off the bench. Ryan Anderson added 12 points, while Clint Capela another 12 points along with 10 rebounds. The Rockets bench only chipped in 24 points in total, while the team's 25 turnovers stand-out as a major issue. The Rockets will move on to Washington for their next contest, Monday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks blew out the Sacramento Kings to the tune of a 117-91 scoreline on Saturday at BMO Harris Bradley Center. 

Milwaukee took care of business against the Kings here, as they pulled out the rare wire-to-wire win. The first and third quarters is when they made their mark. In fact, the Bucks led by 10 after the first quarter and started the third quarter on  a 21-3 run to really open things up. Milwaukee dominated with their defense, as they forced Sacramento to shoot 39 percent from the field. In addition to that, the Bucks recorded 10 blocks and 12 steals in the win, scoring 29 points off turnovers. Fastbreak points were a huge difference as well, with Milwaukee scoring 26 fastbreak points to the Kings one. 

Sacramento (2-5) has been playing better defense this season, but this was a dud of a performance. Without Rudy Gay in the lineup, there was no help for DeMarcus Cousins, as he was double teamed all night long. Cousins still finished with 15 points and four rebounds, but went just 5-of-12 from the field. Garrett Temple led the team in scoring, as he amassed 19 points, three rebounds, four assists and three steals off the bench. No other player scored in double figures, with 13 players featuring for Sacramento in their blowout loss.

Milwaukee (4-2) continues to surprise folks, as this was their best defensive performance of the season. Giannis Antetokonmpo flirted with a triple-double, accumulating 19 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and four steals in the win. Jabari Parker played great too, totaling 19 points, six rebounds and four steals of his own. Mirza Teletovic was unconscious off the bench, hitting seven three-pointers en route to a 22-point performance, with five of them coming in a row in the first half. 

Sacramento has the unfortunate task of playing again on Sunday, as they to travel to Canada to play the Toronto Raptors. As for the Bucks, they also have to travel on Sunday to play the Dallas Mavericks.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the San Antonio Spurs 116-92 at Staples Center on Saturday.

The Clippers (5-1) took advantage of a major scoring drought at the hand of the Spurs (5-2) from the 9:00 mark to the 3:00 point of the first quarter, where San Antonio was only able to salvage one basket during that period. The Clippers went on a scoring run anchored by Blake Griffin, who went on to score 16 points in the opening period. Los Angeles maintained their strong start throughout the second quarter, and entered the half with an 18 point lead. 

The Spurs were unable to cut into the lead in the second half, as the Clippers rallied behind impressive bench performances from Marreese Speights and Jamal Crawford. Griffin led the way for Los Angeles with 28 points, five rebounds and three assists, while Chris Paul almost notched a triple-double with nine points, eight rebounds and 10 assists. Speights and Crawford combined for 31 points on 10-of-18 shooting. 

San Antonio struggled with their shooting efficiency and finished just over 40 percent as a unit. LaMarcus Aldridge has the standout performance amongst his teammates with 19 points and six rebounds, while Kawhi Leonard has a quiet night with just 14 points, six boards and one assist. Once the blowout was too much for San Antonio, coach Gregg Popovich started to utilize the depth of his bench and rotated eight different players off the bench into the game. No one player on the Spurs played more than 28 minutes. 

Next up, the Clippers host the Detroit Pistons on Monday, while the Spurs get some time off before Spurs host the Rockets on Wednesday.

												The Washington Wizards defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 95-92, at Verizon Center on Friday.

For over 47 minutes Friday, the Hawks' Kyle Korver couldn't find the net despite his best efforts. The veteran guard had come up empty on his first seven shots while also committing four turnovers. However, Korver's first points came at a crucial juncture, as he sank a three-pointer with 41 seconds remaining, closing Atlanta's (3-2) deficit to 95-92. Following a missed three-pointer from Bradley Beal, who led all scorers, Korver had a chance for a game-tying three on the very next possession, but instead tallied his eighth missed shot on nine overall attempts. The misfire allowed the Wizards (1-3) to escape with a hard-fought victory, their first of the season, despite shooting just 38.8 percent from the field.

Atlanta was paced by a pair of 20-point efforts from Dwight Howard and Dennis Schroder, with the former also posting 12 rebounds, an assist and three steals and the latter supplying seven boards and three assists. Paul Millsap was next with 16 points, seven rebounds, two assists and three steals. However, the other two members of the starting five, Kent Bazemore and Korver, created a scoring void by only registering three points on combined 1-of-16 shooting. Mike Muscala and Tim Hardaway, Jr. helped make up some for the lack of production with a pair of 10-point efforts off the bench. Muscala also added seven rebounds, while Hardaway added four rebounds, three assists and a steal. 

Beal contributed a total of 28 points, three assists, two rebounds and a block. Wall posted 21 points, 10 boards, six assists and two steals. Markieff Morris came just a rebound short of a double-double himself, collecting 18 points, nine rebounds, an assist, three steals and a block. Marcin Gortat did accomplish the feat, compiling 12 points, 15 rebounds, a steal and a block. 

The Hawks head back home to take on the Rockets on Saturday night, while the Wizards hit the road to for their own Saturday tussle with the Orlando Magic.

The All-Star guard led all scorers with 34 points on a stellar 14-of-26 shooting tally, with DeRozan taking 11 more shots than the next closest player, backcourt mate Kyle Lowry. His performance, along with that of Terrence Ross's off the bench (20 points) helped Toronto (4-1) to outperform Miami (2-3) by a 44 percent to 38.6 percent mark from the field. 

The Heat were led by Hassan Whiteside's 21-point, 16-rebound double-double, which also included three assists, two steals and a block. Goran Dragic was next with 17 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal. Justise Winslow provided 13 points, four assists, three boards and two steals. Tyler Johnson continued his strong play off the bench, leading the reserves with 16 points, four rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks. James Johnson also went for double-digit scoring in limited time, supplying 11 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block over just 19 minutes. 

DeRozan added four assists and four rebounds to his game-high scoring total. Lowry posted 13 points, eight rebounds, five assists, three steals and three blocks, but the inconsistent shooting that has plagued him at times in the season's early going surfaced once again. Lowry drained just four of 15 field-goal attempts, including two of his eight tries from beyond the arc. Jonas Valanciunas only posted five points but did haul in 11 boards, while Ross added four rebounds and a steal to his bench-leading point haul. Among the first unit, DeMarre Carroll was notably held scoreless over 20 minutes, contributing only one rebound. 

The Heat head to Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder on Monday night, while the Raptors await the Sacramento Kings for a Sunday evening tilt.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the host Brooklyn Nets 99-95 at Barclay's Center on Friday. 

In a game that was tight throughout the fourth quarter, it took a lot of swings to get Charlotte their win. The most decisive stretch for the Hornets was a 19-3 run in the third quarter, as they took a lead after trailing by double-digits just six minutes earlier. Brooklyn actually led this game for the first 30 minutes, as there were only two ties and one lead change for the entirety of the game. Both teams shot poorly in this game, as they both shot under 41 percent from the field and under 33 percent from three-point range. 

Charlotte (4-1) continues to grow after a resurgent 2015-16 season, as they overcame a double-digit deficit in this road win. Kemba Walker was the player of the game, scoring a game-high 30 points on 11-of-22 shooting. Nicolas Batum was second on the team, with his 18 points and nine rebounds. Cody Zeller was the only other starter in double figures, tallying 10 points, six rebounds and six assists. Spencer Hawes led the bench, dropping 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting. Charlotte will be off until Monday, when they host the Indiana Pacers.

The Nets (2-4) have been one of the surprises of the season and they nearly pulled out another upset here. It was a team effort for Brooklyn, as they had seven players score at least eight points. Sean Kilpatrick led the team in scoring with his 19 points, four rebounds and four assists off the bench. Brook Lopez was second on the team, with his 18 points and three boards. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had his best game of the season, accumulating 11 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four steals in the loss. Trevor Booker double-doubled as well, totaling 12 points and 13 rebounds. The Nets have an even longer break that the Hornets, as they host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday for their next game.

												The New York Knicks defeated the host Chicago Bulls 117-106 at United Center on Friday. 

Recent results from these teams would indicate a different outcome, but the Knicks showed some resiliency here on the road. New York actually led by 16 at times in the first quarter, before allowing the Bulls to take their first lead in the second quarter. The Knicks responded by recapturing the lead in the third and kept it for the entirety of the fourth quarter. New York shot 52 percent from the field and assisted on 31 of their 46 made baskets. They did that dominating the turnover differential as well, committing just five, while forcing 12 from the Bulls. 

The Knicks (2-3) got some great performance from their starters here, as all five scored at least 15 points. Kristaps Porzingis led the team, scoring 27 points to go along with his five boards. Carmelo Anthony wasn't far behind, tallying 25 points, six rebounds and four assists of his own. Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose both played great in their return to Chicago. Noah tallied 16 points, nine rebounds and four assists, while Rose finished with 15 points, seven rebounds and a season-high 11 assists. 

The Bulls (3-2) had a tough task here against some former Chicago players and they simply didn't play well enough to win. Dwyane Wade did all he could though, scoring a game-high 35 points on 12-of-20 shooting. He also provided 10 rebounds and hit five more three-pointers  in the loss. Jimmy Butler was the only starter in double figures, dropping 26 points of his own. Nikola Mirotic was a nice spark off the bench, totaling 14 points and six boards. 

The Knicks return to action on Sunday when they host the Utah Jazz, while Chicago travels to Indiana on Saturday to play the Pacers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 99-88, at FedEx Forum on Friday.

The Grizzlies (3-3) typically make their opponents grind for every point, and Friday was no different. The Clippers (4-1) struggled for the second straight game, with one notable exception. Chris Paul supplied a team-high 27 points, while also dishing out a season-best 11 assists and notching six steals for a second consecutive contest. The scoring total was greatly aided by a game-high 15 trips to the free-throw line, with Paul parlaying all but one into points. With the other four members of the first unit combining for just 36 points and the team posting 37.6 percent and 29.6 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively, the All-Star guard's contributions were particularly essential in securing the road victory. 

Blake Griffin was second behind Paul with a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double, and he added two assists and a steal. J.J. Redick posted 12 points, a rebound and two steals. While DeAndre Jordan poured in just six points, he hauled in a season-high 21 boards, 15 of which came on the defensive glass. Although no one bench player stood out, the reserves combined for a solid 36 points, helping to supplement the scoring total overall.  

Memphis received a season-high 30 points from Mike Conley, which he supplemented with 10 assists, two rebounds, a steal and two blocks. Marc Gasol was the only other member of the first until to hit double digits in the scoring column, posting 21 points, nine rebounds, four assists, two blocks and a steal. James Ennis supplied nine points and 11 boards, along with two assists, a steal and a block. Zach Randolph nearly managed a double-double while pacing the bench, collecting 15 points, nine rebounds and two assists over 28 minutes. 

The Clippers head to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Saturday night, while the Grizzlies remain home to await the Portland Trail Blazers for a Sunday afternoon tilt.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans 112-111 in overtime on Friday at Smoothie King Center.

In a game between two struggling teams, neither were able to grab a double-digit lead for the entirety of the contest, as it went into overtime. There were actually 12 ties and eight lead changes, with big shots being hit by both teams in regulation and overtime. The Pelicans defense was solid in the loss, as they forced the Suns to shoot 42 percent, while recording 14 blocks in the win. Free-throw shooting is what kept it close, as New Orleans went 15-of-28, with the Suns going 24-of-28. Rebounding propelled Phoenix, as they snatched down 58, while holding the Pelicans to 45. 

The Suns (2-4) have been to overtime three times this season and that's now a record for the first six games of the year. Devin Booker was the player of the game, scoring a career-high 38 points before fouling out in overtime. T.J. Warren hit the game-winning lay-up with eight seconds left in OT, as he finished with 18 points, six rebounds and four steals. Tyson Chandler double-doubled, totaling 15 points and 18 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe finished with 17 points, seven rebounds and four assists. On deck for Phoenix is a road matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. 

The Pelicans (0-6) have now started with six-straight losses for the second-straight season. It wasn't for a lack of teamwork though, as seven players scored in double figures in this loss. Anthony Davis led the team, as he tallied 22 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks. Terrence Jones started at power forward, accumulating 19 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four blocks in his best game of the year. Lance Stephenson ran a lot of point guard off the bench, recording 10 points and seven assists in 27 minutes of action. It doesn't get any easier for New Orleans, as they travel to Oakland to play the Golden State Warriors on Monday for its next game.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Dallas Mavericks on Friday, 105-95, behind 42 points from point guard Damian Lillard.  

It was a tight game until the fourth quarter, as Portland (3-3) held just a three-point lead at the end of the third.  It was Lillard time the whole way, however, as the point guard delivered his highest-scoring performance of the season thus far.  Lillard's 42-point eruption on 12-of-18 shooting helped make up for cooler nights from backcourt partner C.J. McCollum, who scored just nine points, and the Portland bench, who combined for just 14. The team played a perimeter-focused game, scoring 36 points on three-point shots, including 15 from Lillard.

Dallas (0-5), meanwhile, saw yet another loss come in Friday's matchup.  The team has yet to pick up a win in the 2016-17 season, and has seen major shooting struggles thus far.  These struggles continued against Portland, as the team shot just 41 percent from the field.  Veteran team leader Dirk Nowitzki, who was recently sidelined due to an illness, came back to play just 16 minutes on Friday.  Nowitzki scored only five points on 2-of-6 shooting.  Shooting guard Wesley Matthews, meanwhile, was seemingly invisible on the floor, shooting just 1-of-6 and recording no rebounds and one assist in 29 minutes of play.

Portland will face off against Memphis on Sunday, while Dallas will hope to finally pick up a win as they host Milwaukee.

												The visiting San Antonio Spurs took their revenge on the host Utah Jazz, beating them, 100-86, in a rematch of Wednesday's matchup.  

Kawhi Leonard continues to show an expanded role in the San Antonio (5-1) system, as he is now averaging 28.5 points per game on the year, up more than seven from the career high he set last season.  Leonard was the unequivocal leader of the team in the blowout, posting team-highs in points (29), rebounds (11), and assists (four).  After suffering a loss to Utah earlier in the week, the Spurs came out strong on the Jazz's home court, establishing a 10-point lead by the end of the first quarter.  Tough defense was the story for San Antonio, as the team held the Jazz to just 37.5 percent from the floor.

The Jazz (3-3), meanwhile, saw stagnant offensive play for much of the game.  Star Gordon Hayward and bench contributor Alec Burks remain sidelined by injury, while star Derrick Favors is still struggling following a knee injury that kept him out during the preseason.  Favors could not get his shots to fall on Friday, hitting just 3-of-13 from the floor. Sophomore Rodney Hood, meanwhile, continued to see increased minutes in Hayward's absence, leading the team with 18 points.

The Spurs will return to San Antonio to host the Kings on Saturday, while the Jazz will travel to New York on Sunday to play the Knicks.

												The host Los Angeles Lakers handily defeated the Golden State Warriors on Friday, 117-97.

It was Lakers (3-3) coach Luke Walton's first game against the Warriors since leaving the organization over the offseason.  Walton coached the Warriors for the beginning of their historic 2015-16 regular season in place of an injured Steve Kerr, but later left to pursue the head coaching job in Los Angeles.  Walton certainly got the best of his former team, as the Lakers were able to maintain their hefty halftime lead down the stretch.  The team successfully capitalized on their size advantage, holding a 51-40 advantage in the rebounding column.  Third-year forward Julius Randle led the team with 20 points and was a monster on the boards, pulling down 14 rebounds.  The Lakers also saw success from the line, hitting over 90 percent of their free-throws.

For the Warriors (4-2), it was a tough night from beyond the arc. After showing dominant offensive flow on Thursday in a rout of the Thunder, the Warriors shot just 5-for-32 from three in Friday's contest.  This included 0-for-10 for Steph Curry, whose NBA-record streak of 157 games with a three-point make finally came to an end.  The results weren't much better for Klay Thompson, who went just 2-for-10.  Kevin Durant, meanwhile, continued to perform with his new team, leading the game with 27 points.

The Lakers will host the Suns on Sunday, while the Warriors will host the still-winless Pelicans on Monday.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Sacramento Kings, 102-94, at Amway Center on Thursday.

The blueprints of the Magic (2-3) and Kings (2-4) were both on display Thursday, and Orlando showed why it's sometimes better to have a collection of above-average players than a top-heavy attack heavily focused on one superstar talent. The Magic received a standout performance from Evan Fournier, who tallied a season-high 29 points, as well as double-digit scoring efforts from three other members of the first unit, and a double-digit assist performance from the one member of the group who didn't get there, Elfrid Payton. Meanwhile, the Kings received the lights-out production they are used to seeing from DeMarcus Cousins, while the rest of the starters struggled to maintain consistency through four quarters. The imbalance partially led to Sacramento progressively losing steam after winning the first period by a 29-23 margin, and despite a third-quarter resurgence, they produced only 16 points in the 12 minutes to fall short.

Cousins' final line consisted of 33 points, seven rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block. Rudy Gay was the next closest in terms of usage and scoring, tallying 16 points but adding only two rebounds, two assists and a steal. Ty Lawson was the only other member of the starters to log double-digit scoring, supplying 11 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Arron Afflalo registered three points on 1-of-6 shooting, while Kosta Koufos totaled two points but added seven boards, an assist and a steal. Ben McLemore helped make up for some of Afflalo's shortfall with a 11 points off the bench, while Omri Casspi paced the reserves with a 12-point tally.

Fournier complemented his team-high scoring haul with an assist and a rebound. Serge Ibaka continued his recent stretch of solid play with 17 points, three boards and a block while frequently dealing with Cousins down low. Aaron Gordon registered a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists, a steal and a block. Nikola Vucevic came within a rebound of also accomplishing the feat, managing 10 points, nine boards, three assists and two steals. Elfrid Payton collected six points but added the aforementioned 11 dimes and hauled in three boards. Jeff Green paced the reserves with 15 points and also had three rebounds. 

Sacramento now heads to the Midwest for a showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, while the Magic await the Washington Wizards for a Saturday night tussle.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Indiana Pacers, 125-107, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Thursday. 

The Pacers have been surprisingly porous on defense over the early going of the new campaign, and they appeared to bottom out Thursday. The Bucks were able to shoot a stellar 58 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from three-point range. Eight players shot 50 percent or better for Milwaukee, including four starters, as well as three players who took double-digit shot attempts. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker combined for 54 points on 35 field-goal tries, leading the way for a Bucks squad that outscored Indiana by a 96-77 margin over the final three quarters.

Indiana had a strong shooting night in their own right, managing success rates of 46.9 and 43.5 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively. They were paced by Paul George, who totaled 23 points, four rebounds, an assist, two steals and two blocks. He was, however, guilty of a game-high six turnovers, with four of them coming in the first quarter. Jeff Teague followed with 16 points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals. Myles Turner had a strong night on offense with 15 points, but could only otherwise contribute two rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. Monta Ellis had an odd stat line of only six points on just four shot attempts, but he also provided 10 assists, three rebounds and three steals. C.J. Miles continued his early-season success with a bench-leading 19 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds, two assists and three steals. 

Antetokounmpo shared the game-high scoring total of 27 points with Parker. The former also registered nine assists, seven boards, two steals and two blocks, while the latter supplied eight rebounds, three assists and a block. Tony Snell was a pleasant surprise on offense once again, managing 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting and adding two assists, a rebound and a pair of thefts. He now has consecutive double-digit scoring efforts. Greg Monroe once again received more minutes off the bench than starter Miles Plumlee and was highly productive with them, posting a 16-point, 16-rebound double-double that also included six assists and a block. Rookie Malcolm Brodgon put together a second straight strong outing, going for 12 points, five assists, two rebounds, a block and three steals. 

The Pacers head right back home for a Friday night date with the Chicago Bulls, while the Bucks host the Kings for a Friday night showdown as well.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday, 102-99.

Minnesota (1-3) ended the first quarter with a comfortable 12-point lead, but quickly saw the Nuggets (2-2) mount a major comeback.  Strong shooting to start the second half allowed the Nuggets to take a commanding lead, as they outscored the Wolves 33-14 in the third quarter.  Small forward Danilo Gallinari led the team with 19 points, which included four three-point shots.  Sophomore center Jusuf Nurkic, meanwhile, posted 18 to go along with two blocks and two steals.  Nurkic's play jumped out despite him being tasked with facing the powerhouse young frontcourt of Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng.  Strong bench play also bolstered the Nuggets, as forward Wilson Chandler contributed 19 points for the second unit.

Despite their second-half implosion, the Wolves saw promising play from a number of young stars.  Towns posted game highs in points and rebounds, scoring 32 and grabbing 14 boards.  It was the highest-scoring night of the season thus far for the reigning Rookie of the Year.  Another recent Rookie of the Year winner, Andrew Wiggins, finished second in the points column, contributing 25 on the night.  Big man Gorgui Dieng, who the Wolves recently signed to a large extension, made a minimal impact, however.  Dieng scored only two points and had four turnovers in the game. 

Both teams will travel on Saturday, with the Wolves taking on the Thunder in OKC and the Nuggets heading East to Detroit.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics 128-122 on Thursday at Quicken Loans Arena. 

The score indicates a closer game than it actually was, as after the Cavaliers (5-0) took a 17-point lead headed into the final period, the Celtics (3-2) came roaring back to at least make the game interesting, but six points was as close as they were going to get. After being rather passive scoring-wise through the first four games of the regular season, LeBron James exploded going for a game-high 30 points on top of 12 assists and seven rebounds in 36 minutes.  The other two members of Cleveland's big three also put together big nights, with Kevin Love recording 26 points and eight rebounds, as he continues his hot start to the season, and Kyrie Irving scoring 23 points of his own. As a team, the Cavaliers managed to do plenty of damage from behind the arc — where they shot 41 percent from — and the free throw line — where they shot an incredible 37 shots from, making 32 of them. 

Boston, on the other hand, came into this game missing both Jae Crowder (ankle) and Al Horford (concussion) and were carried by their starting backcourt consisting of Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley. Thomas recorded a game-high 30 points while scoring nearly half of his points from the free throw line, as he shot 14-of-14 from the charity stripe. The rest of his Boston teammates struggled getting to the line, however, as they shot just 5-of-8 from the stripe over the course of Thursday's game. Bradley wasn't too far behind, recording a double-double of 26 points and 10 rebounds over 39 minutes. It was rookie Jaylen Brown, however, who had the game's breakout performance, scoring a career-high 19 points and grabbing five rebounds after getting the start in place of the injured Crowder. 

Up next, the Cavaliers will head to Philadelphia on Saturday to take on the 76ers, while the Celtics will have off until Sunday when they will take on the Nuggets.

												The Golden State Warriors blew out the Oklahoma City Thunder 122-96 on Thursday at Oracle Arena. 

This was Kevin Durant's first game against his former team and he showed them why he's one of the best players in the league. Durant dropped 39 points on his former mates with 29 of those coming in the first half. What was ultimately decisive was the second quarter, in which the Warriors outscored the Thunder 37-11. The defense was great for Golden State as well, as they held Oklahoma City to 40 percent shooting and blocked away 14 shots in the win. Free-throw shooting was a huge disparity as well, with the Thunder going just 16-of-28 and the Warriors going 16-of-20. 

The Thunder (4-1) came into this game undefeated, but left feeling like they lost more than just a game. Russell Westbrook was especially discouraged, as he shot just 4-for-15 from the field and committed six turnovers in the defeat. With that said, he did tally 20 points, six rebounds and 10 assists in 28 minutes of play. Victor Oladipo led the team in scoring, dropping 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting. Steven Adams and Domantas Sabonis were the only other Thunder players in double figures, scoring 11 a piece. On deck for the Thunder is a matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday, which is the start of a five-game homestand.  

The Warriors (4-1) had a lot of expectations headed into the season and games like this show why. Durant was especially impressive, as he scored his 39 points on 15-of-24 shooting, while making seven three-pointers. Stephen Curry was second on the team, as he accumulated 21 points and seven assists in the win. Klay Thompson scored 18 of his own, while also providing two rebounds, three assists and two steals. Draymond Green and Zaza Pachulia dominated down low, combining for 17 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals and seven blocks. Golden State has a quick turnaround for their next game, as they travel to play the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday for their next game.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the host Washington Wizards 113-103 at Verizon Center on Wednesday.

In a game that was never separated by more than 12 points, the Raptors were able to prevail by getting to the basket at will. Both teams shot very efficiently, as they both shot over 55 percent from the field. The big difference was the interior play, as the Raptors scored 68 paint points, while holding the Wizards to just 28. Turnovers were an issue for Washington as well, as they committed 21 and allowed the Raptors to score 31 points off those turnovers. 

Toronto (3-1) continues to score at will and they are riding the hot shooting hand of DeMar DeRozan. The shooting guard has scored at least 32 points in all four games this season and finished this outing with a 40 spot. He added five rebounds and five assists with his 40 points and shot 14-of-23 from the field and 11-of-16 from the free-throw line. Kyle Lowry was the only other starter with more than 10, as he scored 18 points and recorded four steals in the win. Patrick Patterson and Terrence Ross were a nice spark off the bench, accumulating 25 points, five rebounds and four assists. 

Washington (0-3) has gotten off to a rough start this season, as the defense continues to struggle. In fact, they have now allowed at least 112 points in every game so far this season. John Wall did everything he could to pull out a win though, as he tallied a season-high 33 points, 11 assists and five rebounds in the loss. It wasn't all sunshine and roses though, as Wall also committed nine turnovers and missed two late crucial free-throws. Otto Porter had his best game of the season, totaling 23 points and 13 rebounds on 11-of-13 shooting. Bradley Beal and Marcin Gortat finished with 15 points a piece as well. 

Both teams return to action on Friday, as the Raptors host the Miami Heat and the Wizards host the Atlanta Hawks.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 109-93, at Spectrum Center on Wednesday.

As was the case Tuesday against the Magic, Philadelphia (0-4) put together a strong first half that resulted in a halftime advantage. However, as Orlando had done a night prior, the Hornets (3-1) came storming out of the locker room for the third period and quickly erased the 53-46 deficit they'd reached intermission with. They outscored the Sixers by a margin of 39-20 over the next 12 minutes, establishing enough of a cushion to keep the visitors at bay in the fourth. Charlotte established a particular advantage with their overall shooting, as they outperformed Philadelphia by a near-10 percent margin (49.4 to 39.5) from the field.

The Sixers once again received a strong effort from third-year man Dario Saric, who co-led the team with 14 points, which he complemented with seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Newcomer Ersan Ilyasova, just traded to Philadelphia from Oklahoma City, made a splash in his debut with a 14-point effort himself from the bench over 23 minutes. Gerald Henderson and Richaun Holmes turned in a pair of 11-point efforts, with the latter getting the start at center in place of the resting Joel Embiid and ahead of Jahlil Okafor. Sergio Rodriguez continued his solid play with 10 points, five assists, three rebounds and a block. Okafor checked in second on the reserves with 12 points, five boards, an assist and a steal. 

As usual, the Hornets were paced by Kemba Walker, who totaled 22 points, seven assists and four boards. Backcourt mate Nicolas Batum was right behind with 20 points, seven rebounds, four assists and a steal. Combined, the two guards went 14-of-29 from the field and 6-of-15 from beyond the arc. Cody Zeller received another start with Roy Hibbert still sidelined with a knee injury and tallied 13 points, a rebound and a block. Marvin Williams supplied 11 points, eight rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals while Michael Kidd-Gilchrist mustered a modest six points but brought down 13 boards, dished out an assist, recorded three steals and also had one block. Frank Kaminsky III, getting some extra run as well due to Hibbert's absence, led the bench with 14 points, five rebounds, an assist and a steal, while Marco Belinelli went for 11 points, three rebounds and a pair of dimes in a reserve role as well. 

Philadelphia heads back home to face off with the defending champion Cavaliers on Saturday night, while the Hornets head up north to Brooklyn to tangle with the Nets on Friday evening.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Detroit Pistons, 109-101, at Barclays Center on Wednesday. 

The Pistons came in to Wednesday riding a 3-1 record, while the Nets sported a 1-3 mark that seemed indicative of their lack of offensive firepower. However, a pair of standout efforts from Brook Lopez on the first unit and Sean Kilpatrick off the bench led Brooklyn (2-3) to the upset victory and stellar 53.9 and 48.1 percent success rates from the field and three-point range, respectively. The Nets were also superior around the basket, as they outrebounded the visitors by a 45-38 margin, with 40 of those boards on the defensive end. They also outscored Detroit (3-2) 50-34 in the paint, while holding standout big man Andre Drummond to a season-low six points and six rebounds. 

The reliable duo of Marcus Morris and Tobias Harris co-led the Pistons with a pair of 23-point efforts, with the former adding four rebounds, two assists and three steals and the latter also supplying four boards, an assist and a steal. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the only other member of the starting five with double-digit scoring, totaling 15 points and also registering seven rebounds, two assists and four steals. Jon Leuer continued his strong work off the bench in the early going this season, compiling 11 points, seven rebounds and two blocks, while fellow veteran Beno Udrih managed 10 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. 

Lopez exploded for a 34-point, 11-rebound double-double to lead the way for the Nets, and added an assist, a steal and a block. The versatile big man went 12-of-21 from the field and also impressively drained half of his eight long-range tries. Bojan Bogdanovic collected 11 points, four rebounds and a pair of assists, while Jeremy Lin supplied 10 points, four assists and a pair of boards. Kilpatrick led the bench with a season-high 24 points and 10 rebounds while also dishing out three assists and recording two steals. Joe Harris was also strong in a reserve capacity, contributing a 13-point effort.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the New York Knicks, 118-99, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday.

The James Harden Experiment at point guard had been an unqualified success over the first four games of the season, and Wednesday was yet another testament to its efficacy. The perennial All-Star led the way for Houston (3-2) once again with a 30-point, 15-assist effort that also included six rebounds and a pair of steals. Despite serving as an excellent facilitator for scoring opportunities for his teammates, Harden continues to also put up plenty of shots, recording 16 attempts in the victory. Houston impressively bounced back on the second game of a back-to-back after suffering a 128-120 loss to the Cavaliers on Tuesday.

Harden's backcourt mate Eric Gordon continues to serve as an outstanding complementary presence, managing 21 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Ryan Anderson was just a rebound short of a double-double with 16 points and nine boards. Trevor Ariza took the court despite suffering a facial laceration in Tuesday's game and managed eight points, four rebounds, three assists and four steals in a gutsy performance. Montrezl Harrell paced the bench with a 17-point, 10-rebound double-double in 27 minutes. 

The Knicks' (1-3) attack was spearheaded by Carmelo Anthony, who finished with 21 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee were next with a pair of 16-point outings, with the former also posting four rebounds, four assists and two steals and the latter managing an assist, two steals and a block. Big men Joakim Noah and Kristaps Porzingis notably came up small on the stat sheet, combining for just three points, which all came from the latter. Brandon Jennings led the reserves with 12 points, three rebounds and three dimes.

The Rockets head south to Atlanta for a Saturday night tussle with the Hawks, while the Knicks tangle with the Bulls on Friday night in Chicago.

												The visiting Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, 123-116.

It was the best offensive night of the season for the Lakers, as the team recorded 123 points on 54 percent shooting from the floor.  Sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell led the charge with a team-high 23 points.  After coming off the bench for a large portion of the 2015-16 season, Russell has seen an expanded role thus far as a starter under new coach Luke Walton.  This was evident on Wednesday night, as Russell not only led the Lakers in scoring but dished out eight assists.  Los Angeles also saw a boost from their bench, as three players scored at least 14 points for the second unit.  Despite trailing at halftime, LA was able to come out strong in the second half and catch up to the Hawks in the third quarter before outscoring Atlanta 33-22 in the fourth to seal the win.  

New acquisition Dwight Howard had his biggest game as a Hawk, scoring 31 on his former team.  Howard also recorded 11 rebounds and shot an efficient 12-of-16 from the field.  While Howard crashed the boards effectively, the team finished with a four-rebound deficit on the night.  A cold shooting night from the rest of the starting five also hurt the Hawks.  Shooting guard Kyle Korver struggled particularly, as he was just 1-for-6 from the field, scoring only three points on the night.

												The host Memphis Grizzlies defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans, 89-83, in overtime on Wednesday.

It was a low-scoring affair all-around, as both teams struggled to get their shots to fall.  Memphis shot just 35 percent from the floor, including 3-of-18 from star center Marc Gasol.  Gasol still contributed, recording 11 rebounds and five assists.  Gasol also helped lock down superstar Anthony Davis, who was held to just 10 points on the night.  Davis had a historic start to the season, scoring 95 points in his first two games.  However, he was not performing at the same level on Wednesday, being held to just 3-of-13 from the field.

New Orleans, who has been missing guard Jrue Holiday and wing Tyreke Evans, is now 0-5 on the season.  It was a particularly weak night for the team's starting five, who combined for just 19 points.  New Orleans did, however, force the Grizzlies into overtime while seeing significant contributions from young players.  Sixth overall pick Buddy Hield established his new career high with 18 points.  Newly-acquired guard Lance Stephenson led the team with 45 minutes played and 21 points scored.

Both teams will play at home on Thursday, with the Grizzlies facing the Clippers and the Pelicans facing the Suns.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls 107-100 on Monday at TD Garden. 

The Celtics (3-1) handed the Bulls (3-1) their first loss of the regular season as they jumped out to a very hot start, holding a lead that grew to as high as 14 points midway through the second period. Then, Boston's Jae Crowder went down with a sprained left ankle after scoring 10 points in 14 minutes, and from there, the Bulls went on a run to end the half and ultimately closed the gap to within three. The two teams stayed tight, but Boston was able to close out the game and win in the rematch over Chicago. 

After Crowder went down early, it was Amir Johnson who surprisingly came alive in the second half of the game, as he finished shooting a scorching 9-of-11 from the field and 4-of-4 from behind the arc. Johnson had only attempted one three through the first three games of the season. Isaiah Thomas matched Johnson's 23 points while adding 10 assists for his first double-double of the regular season. 

For Chicago, Jimmy Butler reached 20 points for the second game in a row and for the third time in four games this season. He did, however, struggle shooting from the field, going just 8-of-21 overall Wednesday. On the other wing, Dwyane Wade continues to struggle since his 22-point performance in the season opener. For the second straight game, Wade shot just 5-of-13 from the field, making him 10-of-26 over his last two games for just 27 total points. 

Up next for Boston, they will head to Cleveland Thursday to take on the Cavaliers, while the Bulls will head home Friday and play the struggling Knicks.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the Dallas Mavericks 97-81 Vivint Smart Home Arena on Wednesday.

The Jazz (2-2) notched their second straight victory after a slow 0-2 start to the regular season thanks in large part to the excellent play of their starting backcourt. Starting point guard George Hill scored 20-plus points for the second straight night, putting up a team-high 25 points to go along with six rebounds and four assists, while starting shooting guard Rodney Hood managed to record 22 points and seven rebounds of his own. The two combined to shoot 6-of-10 from the 3-point line, while as a team, the Jazz won the game with their long range shooting, hitting 12 of their 25 shots from long range. 

The Mavericks (0-3) didn't have the same success on their attempts from downtown, shooting just 7-of-26 shots from long range on their way to dropping their third straight game to start the season. Harrison Barnes, the team's high scorer on the night, managed to score just 14 points, while Dallas' starting backcourt consisting of Deron Williams and Wesley Matthews scored only 12 points a piece. Dirk Nowitzki, who returned to action Wednesday after missing last game with an illness, managed just nine points in 29 minutes of play. In the end, it was a night to forget offensively for the Mavericks.  

Up next, the Jazz will stay at home for a rematch with the Spurs on Friday, while the Mavericks will head home Friday to take on the Trail Blazers.

												The Phoenix Suns defeated the Portland Trail Blazers at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Wednesday. 

The Suns (1-4) grabbed their first win of the season in emphatic fashion against a tough opponent in the Trail Blazers (2-3). A neck-and-neck performance from end to end resulted in not one, but two moments that got every Suns fan out of their seats. Eric Bledsoe drove the lane and sank a layup with 0:01 left in regulation to put the Suns up by two points, but Meyers Leonard was the end of a fantastic drawn up play to drop in the buzzer beating equalizer to send the Blazers and Suns to overtime. Phoenix pulled away by six points after T.J. Warren dropped in two free throws with just over :30 left in the overtime period, but the Blazers simply would not go away. After Damian Lillard drove the lane for his own layup, and grabbed the foul, to the tie the game at 115-115 with :06 left, Eric Bledsoe sank the game winning three-pointer to cap off a wild finish in Phoenix. 

T.J. Warren led the Suns in scoring with 27 points, to go along with seven rebounds, while Eric Bledsoe added 20 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Devin Booker tallied 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting in 39 minutes of action. Damian Lillard once again led the Blazers in scoring with 27 points, five assists and five rebounds. Lillard’s backcourt partner C.J. McCollum also tallied a solid scoring mark with 24 points, four boards and five assists. 

Both teams play on Friday, as the Blazers head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks while the New Orleans Pelicans will welcome the Suns.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 85-83 at Staples Center on Wednesday. 

Two undefeated records to open the season and only one was going to leave with that sterling mark still in tact. The Thunder (4-0) came away with an offensively sloppy, but defensively sound victory, save for Russell Westbrook, who continues to pack the box score with phenomenal numbers. DeAndre Jordan was able to put one shot back with :03 seconds left in regulation to cut the lead to two points, but even after Westbrook missed both free throws, the Clippers ran out of time before being able to get a shot off to tie or win the game. 

Both the Thunder and the Clippers (3-1) shot far below average from the field. Los Angeles completed just 39.1 percent of their field goals, while Oklahoma City just edged them out with a lowly 40.5 percent of their own. The Thunder were led by Westbrook, who put forth 35 points, six rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes. Nobody else on the team put up double figures, and Victor Oladipo still has not found a rhythm, as he finished with nine points on 3-of-11 shooting. 

Chris Paul rounded out the stat sheet with a near triple-double, totalling 15 points, nine assists and 11 rebounds, while Marreese Speights continues to add scoring depth off the bench, as the Warriors import added 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting in 16 minutes. 

Next up, the Thunder face a very difficult second game of a back-to-back in Golden State against the Warriors, while the Clippers have a day off before visiting the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Houston Rockets, 128-120, at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday.

Despite LeBron James' well-earned reputation as the linchpin of the Cavs' attack, Kyrie Irving hasn't been a particularly bad second option as a source of scoring. This season, it's been Irving who's taken the reins of the offense over the first four games for Cleveland (4-0), and this was once again on display in what turned out to be a shootout against the James Harden and the Rockets (2-2). The All-Star point guard went for a team-high 32 points and added four assists and two rebounds. As has been the case in each contest, Irving was highly efficient with his shots, draining 10 of 19 attempts from the field overall and finding the net on four of his six three-point tries. Factoring in Tuesday's production, the sixth-year pro has a stellar 53.6 percent (15-for-28) success rate from behind the arc over the first four games. His red-hot shooting helped the Cavs shoot 51.8 and 50.0 percent from the field and three-point range, respectively.

Houston was led by a 41-point effort from Harden, which also included 15 assists, seven rebounds and a steal. The former two-guard has taken well to his new spot manning the point, already averaging 11.8 assists per game while still maintaining a scoring average of 34.8 points. Eric Gordon was a distant second with 16 points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. Ryan Anderson shot well from long distance but not overall, totaling 12 points, four rebounds and an assist. While the stretch-four sank four of seven three-point attempts, he was 0-for-5 from in front of the arc.  Trevor Ariza contributed 11 points, two assists and a rebound, while Nene Hilario paced the reserves with 13 points, five rebounds, four assists and a block.

Kevin Love, whose play often goes under the radar given the typical efforts of Irving and James, continued his strong start to the season with 24 points, five boards, two steals and a block. James tallied a 19-point, 13-rebound double-double and complemented it with eight assists. After a pair of eight-point outings to start the season, J.R. Smith went for double digits in the scoring column for the second straight game, collecting 15 points, three rebounds and two assists. Tristan Thompson contributed 10 rebounds and the duo of Channing Frye and Mike Dunleavy supplied a pair of 11-point tallies from the bench. 

The Rockets now travel to New York for a Wednesday night tussle with the Knicks, while the Cavs remain home and await the Boston Celtics for a Thursday night showdown.

												The Orlando Magic defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 103-101, at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday.

A 28-point second quarter allowed the Sixers (0-3) to take a 57-43 lead into intermission, with their strong first half having been spearheaded by third-year players Dario Saric and Joel Embiid. Coming in to Tuesday, the latter had been primed for a bump in playing time, as fellow center Jahlil Okafor was given the night off to rest. However, Orlando (1-3) came roaring out of the locker room in the third quarter, tallying 41 points during the next 12 minutes. Despite the Magic regaining the advantage, it was a nip-and-tuck defensive struggle in the fourth quarter, with the two teams combining for just 33 points. Overtime looked very probable until T.J. McConnell was charged with a flagrant-one foul on Serge Ibaka, and the latter converted both of his free-throw opportunities into points to seal the first win of the season for the Magic.

Nikola Vucevic and Embiid waged an entertaining battle throughout the night, and Orlando's big man held his own with 24 points, 14 boards, four assists, a steal and a block. Vucevic notably went to the charity stripe only three times, with the bulk of his scoring coming from his strong 11-for-16 tally from the field. Ibaka was right behind him with his first 20-point-plus performance in a Magic uniform, supplying 21 points, four rebounds and two blocks. Elfrid Payton joined Vucevic on the team's double-double club from the night, posting 18 points, 10 assists, three rebounds, two steals and a block. Evan Fournier continued his strong start to the season with 17 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal.  

Saric paced the Sixers with 21 points and complemented them with three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Embiid was next with an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included three assists and four blocks. Veteran Gerald Henderson registered 18 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal. Sergio Rodriguez continued to surprise with 12 points, 11 assists and five rebounds while manning the point. Robert Covington was notably scoreless over 28 minutes, the second straight game in which he's notched a zero in the scoring column. However, Hollis Thompson came off the bench to supply 22 points, along with seven rebounds, an assist and a block.

The Magic return home to face off with the Sacramento Kings on Thursday, while the Sixers hit the road to Charlotte for a Wednesday night date with the Hornets.

												The host Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 115-108 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 

Despite Indiana (2-2) leading for nearly the entirety of the game, the Lakers (1-3) kept it close all night long. The only leads for the Lakers were when they started up 4-0 and when they took a late lead in the fourth quarter at 106-104. Three-point shooting was the difference in the game, as both teams took 28 attempts, with the Pacers making four more than the Lakers. Rim protection was huge as well, as Indiana swatted away eight shots to the Lakers two.

Los Angeles leaned on their bench in this game and nearly pulled out an upset win. Lou William was the leading scorer for the Lakers off the bench, dropping 19 points and five assists. Second on the team was Jordan Clarkson, who scored his 15 off the bench as well. Luol Deng and D'Angelo Russell were the only starters in double figures, as they combined for just 21 points. Larry Nance Jr. set a career-high in steals, as he recorded 11 points, five rebounds and six steals in the defeat. 

Paul George led the team in scoring, as he tallied 30 points, seven rebounds and four steals. In fact, George scored the final 12 points for the Pacers in their tight win. Monta Ellis was second on the team, with his 17 points, three assists and two blocks. Jeff Teague scored just nine points on 4-for-15 shooting, but provided six points and six rebounds as the starting point guard. C.J. Miles also scored 16 points off the bench.

The Lakers road trip continues on Wednesday, as they play the Atlanta Hawks. The Pacers return to action on Thursday in Milwaukee against the Bucks.

												The Miami Heat defeated the Sacramento Kings in overtime, 108-96, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday.

The Heat (2-2) utilized an impressive night from three-fifths of their first unit and a strong defensive effort in overtime to overcome a pair of 30-point efforts from Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins and notch their 15th consecutive win at home over Sacramento (2-3). The hard-fought victory came after Miami blew an 80-71 advantage in the final six minutes of regulation. However, Cousins fouled out with 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter, making the path to an eventual win a bit easier for the Heat. Tyler Johnson was particularly effective in the extra period, tallying seven points to help put Sacramento away.

Cousins added seven rebounds, four assists and a block to his point total. Gay was even more impressive, hauling in 12 rebounds and adding an assist and a steal while also taking a team-high 24 shots. Arron Afflalo had his best game yet in his new Sacramento digs, collecting 18 points, three rebounds and a steal. Those three players provided the majority of the offense, however, as Matt Barnes and Ty Lawson notably combined for just two points (from Barnes) on 1-for-13 shooting.

Goran Dragic paced Miami with his second consecutive 25-point game, and he added eight rebounds, eight assists, two blocks and two steals. Dion Waiters totaled 20 points, four rebounds, four assists, two blocks and a steal, as he continues to serve as a solid source of scoring for the Heat. Hassan Whiteside become only the second player in franchise history to start a season with four straight double-doubles by posting 14 points, 11 rebounds, two blocks and a steal, while Luke Babbitt pitched in with 10 points, a rebound and a steal.

												The Detroit Pistons defeated the New York Knicks 102-89 at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday.

After starting the season with a rough loss, the Pistons (3-1) have now won three-straight games, all at home. The Knicks (1-2) offense was held down in this game, shooting just 41 percent from the field and 32 percent from three-point range. Detroit really turned it on late, as they held New York to just 10 points in the fourth quarter. In fact, New York failed to hit a single shot for the final 5:40 of the game. 

Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer for the Knicks, scoring 24 points to go along with four steals. Derrick Rose was second on the team, with his 19 points and five rebounds. Kristaps Porzingis was the only other starter in double figures, tallying 18 points and six rebounds. Brandon Jennings provided 12 points of his own off the bench. 

All five starters scored at least nine points in the Pistons win, as they all played at least 31 minutes. Tobias Harris led the team with his 25 points and 10 rebounds on 8-for-12 shooting. Marcus Morris scored 22 points on 9-for-14 shooting. Ish Smith and Andre Drummond fell just shy of double-doubles, as Drummond totaled nine points and 13 rebounds, while Smith dropped 10 points and eight assists. 

New York has a quick turnaround, as they host the Houston Rockets on Wednesday for their next game. The Pistons will also play on Wednesday, as they travel to the Big Apple to play the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans 117-113 at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday.

In a battle between two struggling teams, the team with one win prevailed. The key for Milwaukee was their shooting, as they hit 48 percent of their shots and assisted on 30 of their 44 made baskets. The Bucks bench came up big as well, outscoring the Pelicans bench 35-19. Milwaukee also took care of business on the boards, grabbing 50 rebounds to New Orleans' 42.  

The Bucks (2-2) continue to ride Giannis Antetokounmpo at point guard and he continues to succeed, Antetokounmpo finished this win with 24 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, despite dealing with foul trouble all game long. Jabari Parker was second on the team, scoring 21 points on 7-for-14 shooting. Tony Snell recorded his first double-double for the Bucks, dropping 14 points and 10 rebounds. Matthew Dellavedova tallied 11 points, five rebounds and eight assists of his own. Greg Monroe continues to come off the bench, as he tallied six points, 11 rebounds and six assists.

The Pelicans (0-3) have very little aside from Anthony Davis and that showed again here. Davis scored a game-high 35 points, while also providing 15 rebounds, three steals and three blocks in the loss. Tim Frazier continued his good play though, tallying 20 points, nine assists and four steals. Solomon Hill had his best game in a Pelicans uniform, as he dropped 14 points, six rebounds and four assists on 5-for-9 shooting. Buddy Hield was the only productive bench player, as he scored 10 points on 4-for-10 shooting. 

The Bucks return to action on Thursday when they host the Indiana Pacers, while the Pelicans travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Wednesday for their next matchup.

												The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 116-80 at Target Center on Tuesday. 

The Grizzlies (2-2) had essentially conceded the game before tip-off, as they rested both Marc Gasol and Mike Conley on the front end of a back-to-back. This resulted in some major offensive struggles for the Grizzlies, with four of their five starters failing to score in double figures, despite all of them playing at least 20 minutes. Additionally, as a team, Memphis shot a lowly 36.5 percent from the field and 16.7 percent from behind the arc. Rookie power forward Deyonta Davis led the way for the Grizzlies, scoring 17 points and grabbing six rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench. Troy Williams and Andrew Harrison were the only other Memphis players to score in double figures, scoring 14 and 12 points respectively in extended action. 

For the Timberwolves (1-2), they notched their first win of the season in effortless fashion. Zach LaVine shined in the outing, scoring a game-high 31 points in just 29 minutes. LaVine couldn't miss, shooting a scorching 11-of-18 from the field and 5-of-9 from long range. Rookie point guard Kris Dunn also stood out in his rookie debut with Ricky Rubio out with a sprained right elbow, recording 10 points, six assists, four rebounds and five steals in 29 minutes. Everything else was the status quo for Minnesota, as Andrew Wiggins managed to record 17 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns posted a double-double of 11 points and 10 rebounds.

For the Grizzlies, they'll head home Wednesday to take on the Pelicans, while the Timberwolves will return to action on Thursday against the Nuggets.

												The Utah Jazz defeated the San Antonio Spurs 106-91 at AT&T Center on Tuesday. 

The Jazz (2-2) used a 10-0 run to end the fourth quarter to take home an upset victory and hand the Spurs (4-1) their first loss of the regular season. Utah, who didn't allow San Antonio to score a single point in the final 3:47 of the game, was led by the play of starting point guard George Hill, who recorded 22 points, on an impressive 9-of-13 shooting from the field, and seven assists in 33 minutes. Off the bench, it was Trey Lyles who came up big, playing 29 minutes with starting power forward Derrick Favors on a minutes restriction and recording 15 points and seven rebounds in that time. As a team, the Jazz won the game at the 3-point line, shooting a scorching 15-of-31 from behind the arc.

For the Spurs, it was a slow start and a slow finish, but Kawhi Leonard continues to shine with another superstar performance. Leonard recorded 30 points, his third time reaching that number this season, and seven rebounds in 36 minutes. Unfortunately for Leonard, he didn't receive much help from his teammates, as LaMarcus Aldridge's 21 points made him the only other Spur to score in double figures. In the end, it was the Spurs' ineffective shooting performance that led to the loss, as they hit just 43 percent of their shots from the field.

Up next, the Jazz will head home Wednesday to take on the Mavericks, while the Spurs will have off until Friday, when they take on the Jazz once again.

												The visiting Golden State Warriors blew out the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, 127-104, for their third straight road win.

It was a red-hot shooting night for Golden State, as the team hit 56 percent of their shots from the floor including 10 three-pointers.  Reigning MVP Steph Curry led the Warriors with 28 points, including five shots from beyond the three-point line.  The star of the night, however, was bench guard Ian Clark.  Clark scored 22 points on 8-for-8 from the field and 3-for-3 from the free-throw line.  The Warriors also demonstrated tremendous ball movement, recording 36 assists, accounting for 72 percent of their field goals.  This top-notch ball-movement was on full-display in the third quarter, as Golden State recorded 41 points in just 12 minutes.

For Portland, meanwhile, point guard Damian Lillard's 31-point outing was not enough to top Golden State.  Lillard, who scored a career-high 51 points against the Warriors last season, led his team again on Tuesday with a major scoring outburst.  Portland, however, could not compete from the floor or on the glass, as the team hit just 43 percent of its shots and was edged out 45-32 in the rebounding column.

The Blazers will travel to Phoenix on Wednesday, while Golden State will host the Thunder on Thursday in Kevin Durant's first game against his former team.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Denver Nuggets 105-102 at Air Canada Centre on Monday.

Through the season's first two games, Kyle Lowry couldn't seem to find the bottom of the net, shooting just 8-for-29 from the fiedl. Backcourt mate DeMar DeRozan, meanwhile, was playing like a man fully deserving of the $139 million commitment the Raptors (2-1) made in him this past offseason. Monday, it all came together for the talented guard duo, as they combined for a 62-point tally to spearhead Toronto in a victory that was in doubt until the final buzzer. Danilo Gallinari's last-gasp three-point heave nearly found the basket as the clock hit double zeros, but the Raptors averted overtime and won their second home game in three tries.

A trio of 16-point efforts from Gallinari, Will Barton and Emmanuel Mudiay paced the scoring output for the Nuggets (1-2) on the night. Gallinari did a lot of his damage from the free-throw line, where he converted all eight attempts, and was just 3-for-11 from the field. Jusuf Nurkic was dominant down low, notching 13 points, 18 rebounds, an assist, five blocks and a steal. Frontcourt mate Nikola Jokic turned in a solid 12 points, along with four boards and an assist. Jameer Nelson paced the bench with a 13-point effort. 

DeRozan's 33 points led  the Raptors, a scoring total he supplemented with five rebounds, an assist and a steal. Lowry followed with a season-high 29 points and added seven assists, five rebounds and three steals. His final points of the night, a driving layup with 45 seconds remaining, also gave Toronto a little breathing room by extending the lead to 105-102. Jonas Valanciunas continued his strong early-season play with 12 points, nine boards, an assist and a block, while DeMarre Carroll supplied 10 points, a pair of rebounds and a block. 

The Nuggets next head to Minnesota for a Thursday showdown with the Timberwolves, while the Raptors hit the road for the first time this season. Toronto will face off with Golden State in Oakland on Wednesday.

												The Chicago Bulls blew out the host Brooklyn Nets on Monday, 118-88.

Chicago (3-0) remained undefeated after handily winning its first road game. The Bulls got off to a hot start Monday, outscoring the Nets 38-20 in the first quarter. The lead only grew from there, as Chicago outscored Brooklyn in each of the three ensuing quarters. Rebounding played a major role in the win for the Bulls, as they established an 58-45 edge on the glass. Chicago's rebounding advantage showed the same dominance on the glass that the team exhibited in its 55-rebound season opener against the Boston Celtics. Scoring was no problem, either, for the Bulls on Monday, as seven players recorded double digits in the points column.  All-Star Jimmy Butler lead the team with 22.

For Brooklyn (1-3), scoring the ball did not prove quite as easy. The team hit just 34 percent of its shots from the floor, including a lackluster 16 percent from beyond the arc.  Guard Bojan Bogdanovic had a team-high 15 points and was one of only four Nets to score in double figures.  he Nets also saw a significant disadvantage in terms of ball movement, evidenced by the team's measly 14 assists on the night. The Bulls, meanwhile, recorded 26 assists, accounting for 58 percent of their made field goals on the night.

Both teams will take the floor again on Wednesday, with the Bulls taking on the Celtics and the Nets hosting the Detroit Pistons.

												The Atlanta Hawks took care of business at home in a 106-95 win over the Sacramento Kings on Monday at Philips Arena. 

Many looked at the Hawks (3-0) as a project coming into the year, but they remain one of few undefeated teams in the league. The Kings (2-2) actually took a lead into the fourth quarter, but Atlanta outscored Sacramento 27-14 over the final 12 minutes to come away with a win. Free throw shooting was the difference, as the Hawks went 29-of-47, while the Kings went 13-of-19. Sacramento committed 34 fouls in the defeat, as a number of their regulars were in foul trouble all game long. Atlanta won this game despite allowing Sacramento to shoot better from the field, the free-throw line, and from three-point range. 

Sacramento has put an emphasis on defense this season and that showed once again Monday. In fact, the Kings forced the Hawks to shoot under 42 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range. DeMarcus Cousins scored his lowest total of the season, but recorded his second double-double of the year. Cousins finished the game with 14 points and 12 rebounds on 6-for-16 shooting. Rudy Gay once again led the team in scoring, tallying 22 points, three rebounds and five assists in the defeat. Matt Barnes and Ben McLemore provided 26 combined points off the bench.

All five starters scored in double figures for Atlanta, with no player scoring more than 18 points. That player was Dwight Howard, who totaled 18 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks in the win. Kyle Korver was second on the team with 17 points of his own. Paul Millsap stuffed the stat sheet once again, accumulating 12 points, 14 rebounds, eight assists and three steals in the victory. Dennis Schroder went just 5-of-14 from the field, but finished with 17 points, three rebounds and five assists. 

Sacramento has a quick turnaround for their its game, as the Kings travel to Miami to play the Heat. Atlanta, on the other hand, returns to action on Wednesday, when they host the Los Angeles Lakers.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Phoenix Suns 116-98 at Staples Center on Monday. 

The Clippers (4-0) rallied behind their core four starters in Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and JJ Reddick in the blowout win over the Suns. The two teams battled it out through three quarters, and Phoenix was able to keep the game within striking distance towards the end of the fourth quarter, but the Clippers started to pull away through effective pick-and-roll play and Jamal Crawford’s bench performances. 

Crawford aided the starters after making back-to-back baskets early in the final period, and then added a trip to the free throw line, which put the Clippers up by 17 points with 7:50 left to play. Crawford finished with 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting in 27 minutes. The aforementioned core four starters all finished in double figures, led by Paul’s 24 points, eight assists and five rebounds, while Griffin totalled 21 points, five assists and 11 rebounds. 

The Suns (0-4) fail to grab their first win of the season, but got a solid performance from Brandon Knight and hung with one of the Western Conference’s most complete teams through three quarters. Knight scored 18 points, but did not add any assists or rebounds, while Eric Bledsoe rounded out the box score with 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Sophomore Devin Booker was ruled out for the game as he nursed a sprained right big toe. 

Next up, the Suns host the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, while the Clippers stay at home the same day to face the Oklahoma City Thunder.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Utah Jazz 88-75 at Staples Center on Sunday.

As with many contests involving the Jazz, the game was largely a defensive slugfest, with each team counting an 18-point effort as the high-water mark among their respective first units. Blake Griffin and George Hill did the honors for the Clippers (2-0) and Jazz (1-2), respectively, and Austin Rivers, Jamal Crawford and Dante Exum were the only other players on either side to tally double digits in the scoring column. DeAndre Jordan, despite mustering only seven points, did make a key contribution to the hard-fought victory by bringing down 16 boards in a tough matchup against Rudy Gobert. 

Hill added three assists, two rebounds and two steals to his team-high scoring total. Gobert turned in a near double-double with eight points and nine rebounds, and he also produced three assists and two blocks. Joe Johnson and Rodney Hood struggled throughout the night on offense, combining for 12 points on 5-for-19 shooting. Exum paced the reserves with 10 points, which he complemented with two rebounds, two assists and a steal.

Griffin's final stat line consisted of 18 points, 10 rebounds, an assist and a steal. Chris Paul was close to a double-double himself, supplying nine points, nine assists, three rebounds and four steals. J.J. Redick managed only nine points but no other stats, while Rivers' bench-leading effort consisted of 19 points, two rebounds and an assist. Crawford produced 12 points, a rebound, an assist and a steal as the second-leading scorer among the reserves.

The Jazz head to San Antonio for a Tuesday night tussle, while the Clippers remain home to face off with the Suns on Monday night.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the Phoenix Suns 106-100 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday. 

The Warriors (2-1) rode their two biggest stars to victory, as Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry combined for 65 points on a 19-for-33 tally from the field. Durant has -- for the moment, at least -- taken the title of team MVP from Curry, as he's averaged 31.3 points over his first three contests in a Warriors uniform while playing between 37 and 39 minutes in each. Although Golden State struggled considerably from three-point range as a team -- managing only a 27.6 percent success rate -- Curry was lights out from beyond the arc, draining five of his eight long-distance attempts. 

Durant's 37 points led all scorers, a figure that he supplemented with four rebounds, four assists, four steals and a block. He also went to the charity stripe 16 times, converting all but one. Curry was next with 28 points, three assists and a rebound. Klay Thompson came up empty on six three-point tries but did manage 14 points, along with six rebounds, two assists and a block. Zaza Pachulia and Draymond Green only managed five points apiece, but hauled in 10 and 13 boards, respectively. Green also added nine assists and three blocks in 38 minutes.

The Suns (0-3) had a curious stat sheet overall, one that was decidedly tipped towards T.J. Warren and Eric Bledsoe. Warren continues to thrive as a starter, tallying a team-high 26 points, along with six rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. The third-year pro has averaged 28 points over his last two games on 23-of-41 shooting.

Bledsoe contributed 21 points, six assists, five rebounds and a steal. Tyson Chandler provided a modest eight points, but in typical fashion brought down 18 rebounds, and he also dished out an assist. Devin Booker's night was notable for his struggles from the field, as he was only able to muster seven points while finding the net on three of 12 shot attempts overall. Brandon Knight, the third member of the talented backcourt rotation, didn't fare much better with an identical shooting tally, but did pace the reserves with nine points, while adding three assists, a rebound and a pair of steals.

The Warriors head to Portland for a potential shootout with the Blazers on Tuesday, while the Suns are in Los Angeles on Monday night to face the Clippers.

												The San Antonio Spurs remained undefeated in their 106-99 win over the host Miami Heat on Sunday at American Airlines Center.

In a game that was tight throughout, the more veteran squad prevailed. San Antonio (4-0) dominated the shooting, as it hit 56 percent of its three-pointers and 86 percent of its free-throws. Despite tying in defensive rebounds, San Antonio was able to win the offensive rebounding margin 14-6. Miami (1-2) did dominate down low, though, outscoring the Spurs 46-32 in the paint. Another key for the Spurs was their ability to score off turnovers, as they won that battle 21 points to 10. 

Kawhi Leonard was the star for the Spurs once again, tallying 27 points and six assists. The reigning two-time Defensive Player of the Year scored the final 10 points for the Spurs and accumulated 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter. Pau Gasol was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 20 points and 11 rebounds in his first double-double of the year. In fact, their three other starters combined for just 16 points in the win. Patty Mills did provide 18 points off the bench but failed to record any other fantasy-relevant stats in 25 minutes of action. 

Four Heat players scored in double figures in their loss, but no one else did much of anything. In fact, the other five players combined for just 17 points. Hassan Whiteside carried the load for the Heat, contributing 27 points, 15 rebounds and four blocks in the loss. Goran Dragic was second -highest scorer, adding 25 points of his own, while adding five assists and three boards. Justise Winslow had a nice game, as well, totaling 18 points and five rebounds. Tyler Johnson was the only bench player to score more than two points, as he chipped in 12 in 30 minutes of play. 

Both teams return to action on Tuesday, as the Spurs host the Utah Jazz and the Heat host the Sacramento Kings.

												The host Detroit Pistons defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 98-83 at Palace of Auburn Hills on Sunday.  

Detroit (2-1) put a defensive emphasis on this game and that was clear in the first half result. The Bucks (1-2) were held to just 39 points in the first half and trailed by 11 heading into the third quarter. The Pistons held the Bucks to 39 percent shooting from the field and 23 percent from three-point range for the entirety of the game. Detroit also dominated down low, winning the rebounding battle 58-40. The Pistons did a nice job in transition, as well, scoring 21 fastbreak points, while holding Milwaukee to just nine. 

Milwaukee was one of the worst rebounding teams in the NBA last season and that became glaringly evident against a frontcourt like the Pistons' in this defeat. Giannis Antetokounmpo was a lone bright spot for the Bucks, tallying 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Jabari Parker was second on the team with 13 points to go with six boards. Greg Monroe was the only other Bucks player in double figures, scoring 11 points off the bench. 

Andre Drummond notched his first 20-rebound game in this dominating performance. Drummond finished the game with 20 points, 23 rebounds and three blocks in 37 minutes of action. All five starers scored in double-digits for Detroit. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the team with 21, while Tobias Harris chipped in 16 points and five boards. Marcus Morris and Ish Smith provided 11 points each, though both struggled from the field. 

Both teams return to action on Tuesday, as the Bucks travel to New Orleans to face the Pelicans and the Pistons host the New York Knicks.

												The host Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, 113-96.

Thunder (3-0) point guard Russell Westbrook earned his 39th career triple-double and his second in a row, notching game-highs in points (33), rebounds (12), and assists (16).  The impressive performance comes on the tails of a 51-point triple-double from Westbrook in Friday's win against the Suns.  Westbrook's continued dominance helped fuel an easy win for the Thunder on Sunday, as the team maintained a double-digit lead for most of the second half.  OKC put the icing on the cake with a 36-point fourth quarter, in which they expanded upon a massive advantage in offensive efficiency.  The Thunder hit 47.4 percent of shots from the floor, while LA hit just 40.2.  Youngsters Victor Oladipo and Steven Adams also contributed heavily to the win, just hours after reports came out that OKC will be looking to sign both to major contract extensions.

For the Lakers (1-2), meanwhile, recent second-overall pick Brandon Ingram saw limited minutes after suffering a knee injury in the team's most recent outing.  In his time on the floor, Ingram was one of many Lakers who experienced shooting woes, going just 3 of 10 from the field.  Teammate D'Angelo Russell, also a second-overall pick, hit just 7 of 20 shot attempts.  It wasn't just shooting that caused troubles for the Lakers offense, however; the team committed 21 turnovers on the night.

												The Memphis Grizzlies took down the visiting Washington Wizards on Friday, 112-103.

Point guard Mike Conley, who received the largest contract in NBA history over the offseason, took control of the game for the Grizzlies (2-1), scoring a team-high 24 points while also playing the role of primary distributor and dishing out 11 assists. The Wizards were able to keep the game close until the start of overtime, but from there Memphis simply took over. The Grizzlies held their opponents to just three points in OT, scoring 12 for themselves. The bench provided energy for the Grizzlies throughout, as veterans Vince Carter and Zach Randolph combined for 40 points and led the second unit push to the win.

The Wizards (0-2), meanwhile, kept the game competitive despite a tough performance behind the arc. The team shot just 20 percent from long range, including 2 of 8 from beyond the arc for shooting guard Bradley Beal. Washington also saw limited bench contributions, with multiple starters pushing 40 minutes and no member of the second unit scoring in double digits. Ultimately, the Grizzlies' support from the bench carried into overtime, where they substantially outscored a heavily-used Washington starting unit.

The Grizzlies will face the Timberwolves on Tuesday, while the Wizards will rest until hosting the Raptors on Wednesday.

												The Houston Rockets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 93-92 at Toyota Center on Sunday. 

The Rockets (2-1) maintained a lead throughout most of the Western Conference clash with the Mavericks (0-3), which included a 10 point lead at the half. Drama ensued down the stretch, started by Wesley Matthews, who was able to cap of a 7-0 run with back-to-back baskets, which cut the Rockets' lead to two points with 3:02 remaining in the fourth quarter. Matthews' heads up defense forced a turnover on Harden and transitioned the impressive scoring effort to give Dallas a chance to grab its first win of the season. Matthews continued to put the team on his shoulders after draining a 27-foot three pointer to tie the game at 92 with four seconds left in the game, but he also committed a shooting foul on James Harden’s ensuing drive to the hoop with just one-tenth of a second left to play. Harden missed the first free throw but sank the second and that was all that needed to ice the game for Houston. 

Harden went on to put up star numbers again, scoring 28 points to go along with seven rebounds and seven assists. Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson joined Harden in double figures with 14 points each, while Clint Capela was strong on the glass, totaling 10 rebounds. 

Wes Matthews struggled from behind-the-arc, but not when it mattered most for Dallas. Matthews finished with 25 points, five boards and three assists on 9-of-25 shooting (3-of-15 from three). Harrison Barnes started 3-of-5 from the field but ended up missing his next six attempts on his way to a lowly 10 points in 38 minutes of action. 

The Rockets will head to Cleveland to visit the reigning champion Cavaliers on Tuesday, while the Mavericks will visit the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 104-72, at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday. 

The Hawks (2-0) cruised in their victory after pulling away with strength in the second quarter. Kyle Korver went back-to-back from the three-point line midway through the breakaway period and opened up a 12 point lead that kept building upon itself. The 76ers (0-2) were unable to claw their way back into the game once the Hawks started putting together 10-0 scoring runs, they were also unable find a field goal themselves, as the brutal period saw two four minutes field goal droughts to open and close the second. 

The Hawks were balanced in their offensive game plan and spread the ball around to Korver on the perimeter and Paul Millsap in the mid range. Atlanta’s bench was aided by Thabo Sefolosha and Mike Muscala, who combined for 25 points and nine boards on nearly perfect 11-of-12 from the field. Korver buried three shots from behind the arc on his way to 15 points, while Milsap added 17 points, four rebounds and four assists in 27 minutes. 

Joel Embiid was once again the standout performer for the 76ers, as the Kansas product scored 14 points in 15 minutes, to go along with two rebounds, two blocks, one steal and one assist. The efficient showing from the minutes restricted big man is a good sign going forward for a player who has been riddled by foot injuries throughout his young career. As for the rest of the Philadelphia starters, the numbers are not pretty. Robert Covington and Gerald Henderson both were held without any points in 23 minutes and 18 minutes, respectively. Sergio Rodriguez found 14 points and five assists in the effort, and was the only other starter in double figures. 

The Hawks will host the Sacramento Kings on Monday, while the 76ers will stay at Wells Fargo Center and welcome the Orlando Magic on Tuesday.

												The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 104-98, at Spectrum Center on Saturday.

Avery Bradley has long been renowned for his stingy defense and known as more of a complementary presence on the offensive side. It was vastly different story Saturday, however, as the veteran guard exploded for 31 points and a career-high 11 rebounds. The scoring total largely consisted of a personal-best eight three-pointers, and he and backcourt mate Isaiah Thomas combined for over half of Boston's points on the night. They also helped the Celtics (2-1) tally a 48.1 percent success rate from the field, including a 48.4 percent figure from beyond the arc, with the latter number nearly doubling the Hornets' (2-1) number.

Bradley added four assists and a steal to his stellar stat line. Thomas contributed 24 points and added seven assists and a rebound. Al Horford supplied 14 points, four boards, three assists, two blocks and a steal, while Jae Crowder's full stat line included nine points, nine rebounds, four assists, three blocks and two steals. 

Kemba Walker once again served as the linchpin of the Charlotte attack, which has been decidedly top-heavy so far this season. He posted 29 points, three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Nicolas Batum had his hands full all night on defense with Bradley and totaled a modest 12 points of his own, along with six assists, four rebounds and a pair of blocks. No other starter managed double-digit scoring, although Cody Zeller, starting at center, did haul in nine rebounds. Frank Kaminsky III paced the bench with 11 points.

The Celtics head back home to take on the Bulls on Wednesday, while the Hornets face off with the Sixers in a home tilt Wednesday as well.

												The New York Knicks defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 111-104, at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.

The Knicks (1-1) utilized a balanced attack and a solid shooting night to withstand a strong push from the Grizzlies (1-1) in the middle quarters. New York emerged from the first period with a 32-19 lead, only to see Memphis outscore them by a margin of 58-50 over the second and third quarters. However, four members of their first unit managed double-digit scoring, led by Kristaps Porzingis, who posted a game-high 21 points. The Knicks also shot 52.6 percent from the field overall, clearing a path to victory.

Memphis was led by Marc Gasol, who tallied 20 points, six rebounds, three assists and a block. James Ennis continued to effectively hold down the fort for Chandler Parsons (knee), totaling 16 points, four boards and an assist. Mike Conley managed 11 points, five rebounds and five assists, while new starting power forward JaMychal Green produced 10 points, eight rebounds and a block, although he also committed a team-high six turnovers. Zach Randolph and Jarrell Martin paced the bench with a pair of 13-point efforts.

Porzingis added five rebounds, two assists and a block to his aforementioned scoring haul. Carmelo Anthony was right behind him with 20 points, six boards and five assists. Courtney Lee bounced back from a scoreless opener to supply 16 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal. Derrick Rose's full stat sheet consisted of 13 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Former Bulls teammate and fellow newcomer Joakim Noah tallied six points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and a block, but he fouled out after just 22 minutes.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Orlando Magic, 105-99, on Saturday night at Quicken Loans Arena.

The Cavs remain undefeated as they held on to avoid a collapse against the feisty Magic. Despite having not won a game yet this season, the Magic fought hard and right down to the wire in this one. Orlando battled back from a 17-point deficit at halftime to make it a three-point game with about three minutes left but J.R Smith responded with back-to-back three-pointers, to put the Cavs back in control. 

Cleveland (3-0) was led by the superstar tandem of LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, who combined for 43 points, on the second night of a back-to-back. Meanwhile, Kevin Love added 19 points and J.R. Smith chipped in 16, while Tristan Thompson took care of business in the paint, hauling in 12 rebounds.  The Cavs will have a couple days rest before they are back in action on Tuesday when they host James Harden and the Rockets. 

The Magic (0-3) have had a rough start to their season but that can somewhat be expected of a team that is sporting a new look; while, having to face the defending champs after a couple of tough losses is certainly an extra challenge. Nonetheless, the Magic put up a fight as they battled back to give the Cavs a scare late in the fourth. Evan Fournier led the way for Orlando with 22 points in 37 minutes. The Magic look to nab their first win of the season when they visit Philly to take on the 76ers on Tuesday.

												The Chicago Bulls defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers, 118-101, on Saturday night at United Center. 

The Bulls made a statement once again by defeating another formidable conference rival and defending their home court for the second time in a row, to remain undefeated at home and in their 2016-17 season. The Bulls have defeated the Celtics and now the Pacers, after many people questioned how this new look team would gel. 

Chicago (2-0) came ready to play in this one as they poured in 62 points in the first half, while holding Indiana to only 41. Chicago then held on to maintain the lead for the entire second half. The Bulls had good contribution throughout their roster as they were dominated the rebounds and had six players scoring in double figures. Doug McDermott was the high-point man, with 23, while Rajon Rondo dished 13 assists to get his guys going. The Bulls will be back in action on Monday, when they visit Brooklyn. 

The Pacers (1-2) were perhaps fatigued on the second night of a back-to-back, which began with a loss against Brooklyn on Friday night. Paul George and Myles Turner both dropped 20 points but they did not have a ton of support in terms of scoring. The Pacers added some great pieces like Al Jefferson and Thaddeus Young over the offseason but have not been able to get things together in a consistent way yet this season. Indiana will enjoy a couple days rest before it hosts the Lakers on Tuesday.

												The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 110-108, at Bradley Center on Saturday.

With both teams closely matching each other in virtually every category, including the scoreboard, throughout the night, the contest fittingly came down to the final second. A nip-and-tuck fourth quarter appeared to reach a crescendo when Bojan Bogdanovic nailed a clutch three-pointer with 11 seconds remaining to knot the score at 108-108, capping a pivotal 6-0 Brooklyn run that began with 58 seconds remaining. However, it would all prove to be for naught when John Henson grabbed an offensive rebound off a blocked shot by Justin Hamilton on Jabari Parker and tipped it in for the victory as the clock turned to double zeros. 

The Nets (1-2) were led by Bogdanovic, who tallied 26 points and added eight rebounds and two assists. Trevor Booker helped make for the absence of Brook Lopez (rest) in the frontcourt by turning in a 14-point, 14-rebound double-double that also included an assist, two blocks and a steal. Jeremy Lin continued his solid start to his Nets career by turning the trick as well, collecting 12 points and dishing out 10 assists. He also brought down three boards and recorded a trio of steals. Sean Kilpatrick and Luis Scola were key contributors off the bench, notching 15 and 14 points, respectively, with the latter also notably hauling in eight rebounds over just 18 minutes. 

Milwaukee (1-1) saw Rashad Vaughn surprisingly lead the team in scoring while coming off the bench, collecting 22 points and adding a pair of rebounds, a steal and a block over 27 minutes. His scoring total was significantly augmented by a 6-for-12 performance from beyond the arc. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the starters with 21 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Parker supplied 14 points, eight boards, four assists and a steal, while Greg Monroe, coming off the bench and outpacing starter Miles Plumlee by 11 minutes overall, registered 11 points, three rebounds, three assists and four steals. 

The Nets head back home to face the Bulls on Monday night while the Bucks travel to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Sunday evening.

												The San Antonio Spurs took care of the visiting New Orleans Pelicans in a 98-79 win at AT&T Center on Saturday. 

San Antonio (3-0) came into this game as a huge favorite and they didn't disappoint against a struggling New Orleans (0-3) team. The Spurs led by 10 at the half and extended that lead to 23 headed into the fourth quarter. Defense was key for San Antonio, as they held New Orleans to 37 percent from the field and 17 percent from three-point range. The Pelicans were held to just 34 points in the second half, as they had to play this game in the back end of a back-to-back set. 

Anthony Davis was averaging nearly 50 points and 15 rebounds in his first two games, but struggled against an elite Spurs defense. Davis was held to 18 points and five rebounds on 6-for-15 shooting in the loss. E'Twaun Moore tied the team-lead with 18 points of his own. No other player scored in double figures for the Pelicans, as the other three starters combined for just 10 points. The bench did combine for 29 points and 25 rebounds, but most of that came in garbage time.

Kawhi Leonard continued his torrid start, as he scored 22 points in just 27 minutes of play. He actually scored 16 of those points in the third quarter, which is a career-high for a single quarter for Leonard.  Patty Mills started for Tony Parker and finished second on the team with 18 points and five assists. The only other starter in double figures was LaMarcus Aldridge, who totaled 12 points and six boards. 

San Antonio will hop on a plane to travel to Miami for a game on Sunday. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Gregg Popovich rest some starters in that sort of circumstance with his history. New Orleans is off until Tuesday, when they host the Milwaukee Bucks.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Denver Nuggets, 115-113, in an overtime thriller at Pepsi Center on Saturday. 

Damian Lillard continued his epic start to the season, by hitting a game-winning runner in overtime to defeat the Nuggets. Most of the statistics would indicate a Nuggets win, but that simply wasn't the case. Denver dominated at the free-throw line, going 31-for-39, while holding Portland to 15-for-21. Rebounding was huge as well, as the Nuggets snatched down 61 boards to the Blazers 45. Denver shot under 40 percent from the field and lost the turnover battle 17-15 though. The Trail Blazers won despite  failing to hit a shot for an eight-minute stretch in the third quarter, allowing Denver to go on a 17-0 run. 

Portland (2-1) had the tough task of playing an opponent in their home opener and they showed some resiliency at altitude. Damian Lillard carried the load, as he tallied 37 points, five rebounds, seven assists and three steals in the win. Despite shooting just 7-for-20 in regulation, C.J. McCollum finished strong, totaling 23 points, 10 rebounds, three blocks and three steals. Evan Turner and Allen Crabbe both scored in double figures off the bench, combining for 23 points, six rebounds and six assists. 

The Nuggets (1-1) went with a full team effort here, as all five starters scored between 12 and 23 points in their loss. Nikola Jokic recorded a double-double, tallying a team-high 23 points, a career-high 17 rebounds and four steals in the defeat. Emmanuel Mudiay provided 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists of his own. Mudiay actually scored 13 of his 21 points in the third quarter. In a revenge game for Will Barton, the Cincinnati product finished with 16 points, six rebounds and three assists. 

The Nuggets next game will be on the road, as they play the Toronto Raptors on Monday. The Blazers return to action on Tuesday, hosting the Golden State Warriors.

												The Sacramento Kings won their first game at the Golden One Center, defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves, 106-103, on Saturday. 

In a game where there was a 29-point swing, the Kings were able to pull out a big comeback. After trailing by 19 at times in the first half, Sacramento prevailed thanks to a 31-12 third quarter. They dominated the Timberwolves in the paint, winning that battle 48-32. Despite shooting 51 percent from the field, Minnesota had 13 less shots than the Kings and struggled getting the 50/50 balls they needed.

Andrew Wiggins scored a season-high 29 points in the defeat, going 10-for-19 from the field. He did struggle to do much else though, as he recorded just one rebound and one block aside from his 29 points. Zach LaVine was second on the team, dropping 21 points and grabbing five boards. Gorgui Dieng double-doubled in the loss, totaling 14 points and 13 rebounds, dealing with foul trouble in the second half. The bench combined for just 19 points, with five players playing at least 11 minutes a piece. 

DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay continue to carry the Kings, as they combined for 57 of the teams 106 points in Saturday's win. Cousins led the team, tallying 29 points, seven rebounds and four assists before fouling out in the final minutes. Gay finished with 28 points, adding five rebounds, and two blocks. The only other players in double figures were Matt Barnes and Ben McLemore, who scored 25 combined points off the bench. Barnes was a huge spark, adding nine assists and five rebounds to his 12 points. 

Sacramento's next game is in Atlanta against the Hawks on Monday, while the Timberwolves host the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday for their next fixture.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers edged the Toronto Raptors, 94-91, at Air Canada Centre on Friday.

Through two games, Kyrie Irving has looked like the Cavs' MVP, and led the team in scoring once again Friday night. However, he was nearly responsible for allowing a tightly-contested game to potentially go into overtime when he had the ball stolen from him by the Raptors' Patrick Patterson with one second remaining. Following an ensuing Toronto timeout, Kyle Lowry put up a 32-foot last-gasp shot as time expired that failed to find the net, allowing the Cavs (2-0) to escape victorious. The Raptors (1-1) fell short after having come back from a 50-40 halftime deficit by outscoring Cleveland by a 51-44 margin in the second half.

Irving's stat line consisted of 26 points, six rebounds and six assists, but he did commit a game-high seven turnovers. LeBron James turned it on in the fourth quarter after an ordinary first three periods, collecting 21 points, eight boards and seven assists. Kevin Love turned in an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double and added two assists, two blocks and a steal. Tristan Thompson accomplished the feat as well after a lackluster opener, managing 11 points, 10 rebounds, an assist and a block. 

The Raptors were once again led by DeMar DeRozan, who tallied a game-high 32 points and added seven rebounds, two assists and two steals. Lowry stepped up with 17 points, four assists and two rebounds, although, like his point guard counterpart on the Cavs, he had trouble hanging on to the ball, committing six turnovers overall. Jonas Valanciunas continued his stellar start to the season with a 10-point, 17-rebound double-double, and added a block. DeMarre Carroll turned in a modest but full stat line with eight points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks.

The Cavs head back home to take on the Magic on Saturday night while the Raptors face off with the Nuggets at Air Canada Centre on Monday night.

												The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers, 103-94, at Barclays Center on Friday. 

The two teams engaged in a true see-saw battle, with each club dominating in alternate quarters. It was the Nets (1-1) who got hot at the right time, however, as they outscored the Pacers (1-1) by a margin of 31-15 in the final period. After coming into the regular season with serious concerns about potential sources of offense beyond Jeremy Lin and Brook Lopez, Brooklyn had surprised in the opener against the Celtics on Wednesday by tallying 117 points despite the latter only totaling seven points on the night. The box score Friday more closely resembled what had been expected in the preseason, as the pair paced the Nets on offense, with only two other teammates reaching double digits in the scoring column. 

Indiana had a more balanced attack overall, which was led by Paul George's 22 points. He added nine rebounds, two assists and two steals, but only managed an 8-for-22 tally from the field. Thaddeus Young turned in a solid outing against his old teammates, posting 19 points, eight rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block. Myles Turner supplied a solid encore to his standout opening night performance, posting a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included three rejections. Monta Ellis was the fourth member of the starting five to reach double-digit scoring, managing 11 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals. 

Lopez's 25 points paced the Nets, and he supplemented the game-high scoring total with five rebounds, an assist and a steal. Lin came within a shade of a triple-double, totaling 21 points, nine rebounds, nine assists and a block. Trevor Booker registered 10 points, 11 boards, two assists and a steal. Bojan Bogdanovic and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson could only muster a combined six points on 2-for-11 shooting, but Sean Kilpatrick helped make up for the shortfall with 18 points to lead the reserves. 

Both teams return to action Saturday night, with the Pacers taking on the Bulls in Chicago and Brooklyn facing off with the Bucks in Milwaukee.

												The Detroit Pistons didn't disappoint in their home opener, dominating the Orlando Magic, 108-82, at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Friday.

The Pistons (1-1) came into this game off a disappointing opening loss and put it to the Magic (0-2) in this game. The second quarter was especially decisive, as Detroit scored 30 points, while holding Orlando to just nine in that 12-minute stretch. They didn't let up in the third quarter either, outscoring the Magic 32-20. The Pistons were clicking on both ends, as they shot over 50 percent from the field and held the Magic to under 35 percent shooting.

After playing all five starters 35-plus minutes in the opener, the Magic were clearly tired here. No player reached the 30-minute total in this blowout, as 12 players played at least eight minutes. Aaron Gordon was a lone bright spot, recording 17 points and seven rebounds in the loss. Nikola Vucevic did grab 14 boards, but scored just seven points on a 3-for-12 night. Mario Hezonja and Jeff Green both scored in double figures off the bench. 

After leading the league in rebounding last year, Andre Drummond bounced back from his weak opener to grab 20 boards in this blowout win. He also added 12 points and two steals, while doing that damage in just 27 minutes of play. Tobias Harris led the team in scoring, dropping 18 points and four rebounds in the win. Ish Smith was very efficient as the starting point guard, tallying 16 points and eight assists, while going 8-for-13 from the field and committing just two turnovers. Marcus Morris provided 17 points and eight rebounds of his own.

Orlando has a tough task ahead of them, as they play the second half of a back-to-back against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday for their next game. Detroit is off until Sunday, when they host the Milwaukee Bucks for their next fixture.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder come back in overtime thanks to Westbrook's 51-point triple-double to beat the Phoenix Suns, 113-110, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday. 

Despite trailing for nearly the entirety of the game, the Thunder (2-0) were able to prevail in overtime to win their home opener. The Suns (0-2) had an 18-point lead at one point and held a lead until 4:40 left in the fourth quarter, when Oklahoma City took their first lead of the game. In fact, the three-point winning margin was the largest lead the Thunder had all game long. Russell Westbrook carried the load, as he dropped 51 points en route to a triple-double. Rebounding was key for Oklahoma City, as they brought down 57 boards, while holding the Suns to just 44.

The Suns were blown out in their home opener, but showed some resiliency here. T.J. Warren led the team in scoring, dropping a career-high 30 points on 13-for-18 shooting to go along with nine rebounds. Devin Booker was second on the team, tallying 21 points and six rebounds of his own, going  just 8-for-25 from the field. Eric Bledsoe totaled 17 points, six rebounds, six assists and three steals in the defeat. The only other player in double figures was Brandon Knight, who dropped 19 points off the bench. 

This was Oklahoma City's first game without Durant in their home building and Russell Westbrook made fans quickly forget about the former MVP. Westbrook put together a 51-point, 13-rebound, 10-assist triple-double to carry the Thunder to a win. He also went 17-for-44 from the field and made 15-of-20 from the free-throw line. The only other player in double figures was Victor Oladipo, who accumulated 21 points and five rebounds. Steven Adams was a point shy of a double-double, scoring nine and grabbing 10 boards. 

Both teams return to action on Sunday, as the Thunder host the Los Angeles Lakers and the Suns host the Golden State Warriors.

												The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Miami Heat in their home opener, 97-91, at American Airlines Arena on Friday.

The contest was truly a tale of two halves, with the Heat unable to sustain a red-hot start coming out of intermission. Miami (1-1) carried a 57-46 lead into halftime, but Charlotte's bench caught fire in the second half, propelling the Hornets (2-0) to a 51-34 advantage over the final two quarters. Four reserves-- Spencer Hawes, Marco Belinelli, Jeremy Lamb and Cody Zeller-- posted double-digit scoring efforts, helping make up for an unbalanced performance from the first unit that featured only one tally of over 20 points. The Hornets' defense was also key, as they took the ball away from the Heat 20 times, leading to 22 points, while only committing eight turnovers themselves.

Kemba Walker paced the visitors with 24 points, four assists, a rebound and two steals. Nicolas Batum was the only other member of the first unit to reach double digits in the scoring column, collecting 12 points and adding six rebounds, four assists and two steals. Marvin Williams did manage to haul in 11 boards despite contributing a modest seven points, an assist, two steals and a block. Roy Hibbert left the game after five minutes on the court with a sore right knee, going scoreless over his brief stint. Lamb's 16-point, eight-rebound performance led the bench, while Belinelli (12 points), Zeller (10 points) and Hawes (10 points) made key contributions as well. Hawes also came just one rebound short of a double-double and added two assists and two blocks. 

The Heat were led by a trademark Hassan Whiteside double-double (20 points, 15 boards) and he also recored a pair of blocks. Goran Dragic came within an assist of accomplishing the feat himself, tallying 14 points, nine dimes, four rebounds and a steal. Dion Waiters totaled 13 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a steal. Justise Winslow contributed 10 points, six rebounds and five assists, but struggled from the field, going just 4-for-14 overall and 1-for-6 from three-point range. Tyler Johnson paced the Miami bench with 12 points and six rebounds. 

The Hornets head back home to take on the Celtics on Saturday night, while the Heat remain home to take on the Spurs on Sunday.

												The Houston Rockets took down the host Dallas Mavericks, 106-98, in a matchup of divisional rivals on Friday.

Houston was able to pull away in the third quarter on the back of strong three-point shooting.  Forward Trevor Ariza led the team with 27 points and five three-pointers, while All-Star guard James Harden trailed narrowly behind with 26 points and four makes from deep.  Harden also dished out eight assists, showing continued commitment to his new role as point guard.  Harden made the shift under the guidance of new head coach Mike D'Antoni and in part due to the acquisition of shooting guard Eric Gordon.  Gordon scored 18 points, also notching four rebounds and six assists.

For Dallas, meanwhile, new acquisition Harrison Barnes led the way with 31 points.  Barnes, the former Warrior, opened up his career in Dallas with a buzzer beater to force overtime on Wednesday.  He picked back up with a strong outing, establishing himself as the focal point of the Mavericks offense.  Despite Barnes's significant contribution, however, Dallas was simply out-shot from behind the arc.  The Mavericks made just 8 of 29 shot from three, compared to 15 of 32 for the Rockets.

The teams will face off again on Sunday night, with Houston playing host.

												The host Utah Jazz beat the visiting Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, 96-89.

It was the season debut for banged-up Jazz star Derrick Favors.  Favors missed the majority of the preseason and the team's season opener with a bruised knee, but was able to transition back into a limited role for Friday's contest.  The forward came off the bench for an impressive 15 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes, but showed some signs of rust, turning the ball over five times.  His typical frontcourt partner, French seven-footer Rudy Gobert, made a major impact on the defensive end with four blocks.  Gobert's six offensive rebounds also helped the Jazz overcome a poor perimeter shooting night, offering Utah a number of second-chance attempts.

The Lakers, meanwhile, received troubling news, as rookie Brandon Ingram was forced to leave the game with a knee injury after just four minutes of play.  Though not appearing to be serious, the second overall pick will likely be monitored closely going forward.  It was a tough night for young Lakers in general, as guard D'Angelo Russell went just 3-for-14 from the field, while forward Julius Randle scored just seven points and recorded only four rebounds.  The Lakers did manage to find a scoring boost off the bench, as sixth man Lou Williams led the team with 17.

Both teams will travel on Sunday, with the Jazz visiting the Los Angeles Clippers and the Lakers taking on the Thunder in Oklahoma City.

												The Golden State Warriors defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, 122-114.

The Warriors (1-1) bounced back from a nationally-televised 29-point loss to the San Antonio Spurs on opening night.  High-profile free agency acquisition Kevin Durant was the difference maker for Golden State on Friday, leading the team with 30 points and 17 rebounds.  The Warriors depth also showed, as the team was able to pull away with the lead during Anthony Davis's rest at the end of the third quarter.  All-Stars Steph Curry and Klay Thompson made major contributions in the points column as well, scoring 23 and 28 respectively.  The team displayed impressive ball movement, recording 32 assists on the night. 

While the Warriors saw major top-down contributions, the Pelicans (0-2) were able to stay in contention on the back of Anthony Davis.  After opening the season with a 50-point, 16-rebound, near-five-by-five, Davis continued to dominate with a game-high 45 points and 17 rebounds.  'The Brow' was able to convert on a whopping 17 of 31 field goal attempts, including one of two tries from beyond the arc.  Davis did see help from guard Tim Frazier, who posted a 21-point, 10-assist double-double.  Outside of Davis and Frazier, however, no Pelicans starter scored more than four points.  Sixth overall pick Buddy Hield particularly struggled, scoring just two points on 16 percent shooting with two turnovers in 19 minutes.

The Pelicans will see the Spurs in San Antonio on Saturday, while the Warriors will visit Phoenix on Sunday.

												The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Washington Wizards, 114-99, at Philips Arena on Thursday.

A back-and-forth tussle through three quarters turned into a relatively comfortable double-digit victory for the Hawks (1-0) after they outscored the Wizards 33-19 in the final period. The game was largely a battle of both frontcourts, with impressive performances on each club. Offseason signee Dwight Howard, making his Hawks regular-season debut in his hometown, contributed an 11-point, 19-rebound double-double and Paul Millsap paced all scorers with a 28-point effort. Markieff Morris (0-1) led Washington with 22 points, while Marcin Gortat hauled in 11 boards in a tough matchup against Howard.

Morris supplemented his team-high scoring total with four rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Bradley Beal was next with 13 points, which he complemented with four assists. John Wall turned in a 12-point, 10-assist double-double in 30 minutes on the court, and added four steals and a block. Otto Porter was the fourth member of the first unit with double-digit scoring, tallying 10 points and adding six rebounds, an assist and two steals. 

Millsap added seven rebounds, six assists and a block to his 28 points. Howard rounded out his aforementioned stat line with two assists, three blocks and a steal. Dennis Schroder, now the full-time starter at point guard with Jeff Teague's departure to Indiana, finished with 14 points, two assists, two rebounds and a steal. He notably received just 25 minutes on the floor, an allotment reminscent of his days as a reserve. Kyle Korver and Kent Bazemore failed to hit double digits on the scoreboard, combining for 12 points on 3-for-11 shooting.  However, Tim Hardaway, Jr. and Thabo Sefolosha made up for the shortfall from the Atlanta bench, with the former supplying 21 points and the latter turning in a full stat line of 13 points, seven rebounds, five assists and five steals.

The Wizards remain on the road and head to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Sunday night, while the Hawks head to Philadelphia for a Saturday afternoon showdown with the Sixers.

												The Chicago Bulls opened their season Thursday with a 105-99 victory against the visiting Boston Celtics.

Chicago (1-0) jumped out to an early lead, finishing the first quarter with a 30-20 lead. The Bulls new-look backcourt of Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo quickly made contributions, with Wade scoring 14 points in the first half.  The group managed to combat concerns about poor floor-spacing, with Wade and Rondo contributing five combined three-point makes.  Chicago was able to keep the Celtics off the glass extremely effectively, winning the rebounding battle 55-36.  The Bulls' edge was particularly pronounced on the offensive end, as they earned 18 offensive rebounds compared to Boston's three.

Boston (1-1), meanwhile, managed to keep the game close throughout.  All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas led the charge for the Celtics' offense, scoring 25 points.  With bench guard Marcus Smart sidelined by injury, sophomore Terry Rozier saw 22 minutes coming off the bench.  He made the most of his time on the floor, scoring eight points and recording four rebounds and four assists while recording no turnovers.  Boston had a solid shooting night, converting on half of their shots from the floor overall.  However, struggles on the glass ended up weighing the Celtics down despite keeping Chicago to just 39.6 percent shooting.

The Bulls will face the Pacers on Saturday, while the Celtics will take on the Hornets.

												The San Antonio Spurs defeated the host Sacramento Kings, 102-94, at the opening of Golden One Center on Thursday.

In a game that was tight throughout, the Spurs used elite defense to pull away in the second half. In fact, San Antonio held Sacramento to 37 points on 10-for-35 shooting over the final 24 minutes. The Spurs outshot the Kings from the free-throw line, three-point range and from the field while also winning the turnover battle 15-9. Rim protection was huge as well, with San Antonio recording eight blocks and Sacramento failing to swat away a single shot. 

The Spurs (2-0) have handed over the reins to Kawhi Leonard and it was evident in this game. Leonard finished with 30 points, five assists, three rebounds and five steals in the victory. At one point, he recorded three steals and 10 points in a span where the Spurs were able to create a double-digit lead spanning between the third and fourth quarters. LaMarcus Aldridge was second on the team, as he scored 16 points to go along with his five boards. Dewayne Dedmon and David Lee came off the bench to score 12 a piece.  

Sacramento (1-1) had a tough task in the opening of their new home arena and they nearly pulled out an upset win. DeMarcus Cousins carried the load, as he totaled 37 points and 16 rebounds, while going 14-for-16 from the free-throw line. Rudy Gay was the only other starter in double figures, as he tallied 17 points and seven rebounds. Ty Lawson posted a seven-point, nine-assist, four-rebound line, while filling in for the suspended Darren Collison. 

Both teams are in action again Saturday, as the Kings play host to the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Spurs face the visiting New Orleans Pelicans.

												The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 114-106, at Moda Center on Thursday. 

The Clippers (1-0) were the last team to tip off for an opening game amongst the league and capped it off with an impressive road win. The matchup continued where Los Angeles left off at the end of last season's first-round playoffs, save for a fully healthy unit and one that was in a physical mentality throughout the game. DeAndre Jordan and Mason Plumlee got into a scrap after a hard foul landed both in the courtside seats beneath the rim in the third quarter, while C.J. McCollum returned a hard foul Jordan's way at the other end of the floor in the fourth quarter. The referring was also in question at times, much to the home crowd's disapproval, as Blake Griffin and JJ Reddick had flagrant fouls go there way in the second half. 

The back-and-forth affair was tight knit through the first three quarters of play, but the Clippers were able to pull away by 15 points with 2:54 left in the fourth quarter. A series of inspired plays from Harkless, McCollum and Lillard cut the lead to five after a driving layup from the star point guard with :22 left on the clock. Paul drew a foul from Shabazz Napier on the ensuing possession to ice the game at the free throw line. 

Chris Paul and Blake Griffin led the Clippers, as both players were everywhere on both ends of the court, striking from the mid range, putting back dunks, running down the Blazers backcourt in transition and keeping Reddick and Jordan active at the perimeter and under the rim. Paul and Griffin combined for 54 points, 18 rebounds and five assists in the win. Lillard poured in 29 points on 11-of-24 shooting, to go along with 10 rebounds and three assists. Harkless, Plumlee and McCollum joined Lillard in double figures, but the 22.2 percent three-point shooting was far from where coach Terry Stotts would have liked the Blazers to be on their home court.

												The Miami Heat defeated the host Orlando Magic, 108-96, on Wednesday in the season opener for both teams at Amway Center.

Orlando (0-1) was expected to be the more improved team while the Heat (1-0) were supposed to decline, but that didn't show in the opener. A 37-16 run in the second half is when the Heat really pulled away and the Magic simply couldn't respond. Defense was key for Miami, as they held Orlando to 39 percent shooting and outrebounded them 53-44. Points in the paint was a huge factor as well, with the Heat recording 74 paint points to the Magic's 36. 

Many people pegged the Heat as a subpar team, but they showed some resiliency in an impressive opener. Hassan Whiteside tallied a team-high 18 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks in the win. Justice Winslow played well too, accumulating 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Goran Dragic was in foul trouble all night, but still finished with 16 points, six rebounds and six assists.

Orlando went with a short eight-man rotation in the opener and it simply didn't go well. All five starters did score in double figures, but none of them shot over 50 percent from the field. Evan Fournier led the team in scoring, totaling 20 points, four rebounds and four assists in the defeat. Nikola Vucevic recorded a double-double, amassing 17 points and 14 rebounds. Aaron Gordon played 35 minutes in the defeat, scoring 12 points, grabbing eight boards and dishing out four assists. 

Both teams return to action on Friday, as the Magic travel to Detroit to play the Pistons and the Heat host the Charlotte Hornets.

												The Indiana Pacers defeated the visiting Dallas Mavericks, 130-121, in overtime  at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday.

The Pacers (1-0) rolled out a new-look starting five that included offseason acquisitions Jeff Teague and Thaddeus Young, as well second-year man Myles Turner as the new full-time starter at center. It was the latter who had the biggest impact in a back-and-forth contest, pacing all scorers with 30 points, and adding 16 boards, an assist, four blocks and two steals. The Mavs (0-1) countered with some clutch fourth-quarter play from their own key free-agent signing, Harrison Barnes, who capped off a 30-point fourth period for Dallas with a game-tying, 26-foot three-pointer with two seconds remaining in regulation. After a back-and-forth start through the first three-plus minutes of overtime, the Pacers pulled away in front of their home crowd largely on the strength of a pair of three-point buckets from Turner and Paul George, sealing the hard-fought victory.

Dallas was paced by Deron Williams, who supplied 25 points, seven assists, three rebounds and a block. However, the veteran guard was also guilty of six turnovers, the most of any player on either team. The ageless Dirk Nowitzki had a heady assist on Barnes' game-tying three and registered 22 points, eight rebounds, two assist overall, two steals and two blocks. Barnes had a near double-double with 19 points and nine boards, while Wesley Matthews rounded out a successful night for the first unit with 13 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals. J.J. Barea played a robust 39 minutes off the bench, pacing the reserves with 22 points. 

In addition to Turner's breakout performance, the Pacers saw George chip in with 25 points, eight boards, and six assists, with the scoring total including a 4-for-5 tally from beyond the arc. Teague's impressive Indiana debut included 20 points, eight assists, two rebounds and three steals. Monta Ellis touched up one of his former teams for 19 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and three steals, while Young pitched in with 11 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal. 

The Mavs head back to Texas for their home opener on Friday night against the in-state rival Houston Rockets, while the Pacers head north to New York for a Friday tussle with the Brooklyn Nets.

												The Boston Celtics held off the Brooklyn Nets for a 122-117 win in the season opener for both teams Wednesday at TD Garden. 

The Celtics (1-0) came into this game as a 12-point favorite, but the Nets (0-1) made them work for a relieving win. A 36-25 fourth quarter is how Brooklyn crawled back in the game, but Boston did just enough to hold on. The offense was incredibly efficient for the Celtics, as they shot 54 percent from the field and recorded 36 assists on their 48 made baskets. The 22 combined blocks and steals for Boston doubled up that of Brooklyn, who recorded just 11 in total. 

Brooklyn was expected to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, but they gave an elite team a run for their money in the opener. The bench was key for the Nets, as Sean Kilpatrick, Joe Harris and Justin Hamilton combined for 48 points and 18 rebounds off the pine. Hamilton actually finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds in the best game of his career. Bojan Bogdanovic led the team in scoring, dropping 21 points on 9-for-17 shooting. Jeremy Lin played well in his debut as well, amassing 18 points, three rebounds and three assists. 

Boston made this one a nail biter, but they ended up getting their much deserved win. Isaiah Thomas scored a game-high 25 points in the victory, also adding six rebounds and nine assists. Jae Crowder was second on the team, with his 21 points and five boards. Avery Bradley fell a rebound shy of a double-double, totaling 17 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Al Hoford stuffed the stat sheet in his debut, accumulating 11 points, five rebounds, six assists and four blocks in the win. 

Boston will have a quick turnaround, as they travel to  Illinois to play the Chicago Bulls on Thursday. Brooklyn's next game is on Friday, when they host the Indiana Pacers.

												The Charlotte Hornets earned a win on the road in their season opener, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks, 107-96.

The Hornets (1-0) started out hot, jumping to a 15-point lead by halftime.  Point guard Kemba Walker, the runner-up for the Most Improved Player award in 2015-16, led the charge for the Hornets with his distribution, posting eight assists and only two turnovers.  Walker struggled with his shot, however, hitting just 5 of 15 field goal attempts.  Sophomore Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, on the other hand, stepped up his offensive game after missing the bulk of the 2015-16 season.  The former second overall pick scored a team-high 23 points and crashed the glass for 14 rebounds.  Another change in the Hornets lineup was the presence of newly-acquired big man Roy Hibbert.  The former Pacers All-Star recorded 15 points and five blocks in his debut with Charlotte.

Giannis Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, took over for the Bucks (0-1), dropping in a game-high 31 points to go along with nine rebounds and five assists.  Support from his teammates was lacking, however, as no other Buck scored more than 14 points.  Lackluster three-point shooting hampered the Bucks' comeback efforts, as the team hit only three shots from beyond the arc.  New faces Matthew Dellavadova and Mirza Teletovic made their debuts with Milwaukee in relatively quiet fashion, combining for just 17 points and six rebounds while approaching 30 minutes each.

The Hornets will visit the Heat on Friday, while Milwaukee will play host to the Nets on Saturday.

												The Toronto Raptors defeated the Detroit Pistons, 109-90, at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday.

The Raptors (0-1) invested heavily into their star two-guard DeMar DeRozan in the offseason, inking the 27-year old to a five-year, $139 million contract. He began paying immediate dividends on that hefty sum Wednesday, tallying a game-high 40 points and adding four rebounds, an assist and a steal. While the stellar showing wasn't necessarily a surprise from a player of his caliber, the fact that Jonas Valanciunas, and not Kyle Lowry, checked in as Toronto's second-leading scorer was a tad more unexpected. The veteran big man dominated in his showdown with Andre Drummond, posting a 32-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included an assist. The dominant Raptors, which outscored Detroit in every quarter, didn't need much else, with Lowry the only other player to hit double digits on the scoreboard. 

The Pistons (0-1) were led by Tobias Harris' 22 points, which he supplemented with five rebounds, an assist and a steal. Marcus Morris supplied a near double-double with 17 points, nine boards, three assists and a steal, but struggled from long range, draining only a pair of his eight three-point attempts. Drummond tallied 16 points, six rebounds and a steal, while the starting backcourt of Ish Smith and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope only managed 10 combined points on 5-for-19 shooting.

In addition to the combined 72 points they received from DeRozan and Valanciunas, the Raptors saw Lowry pitch in with 10 points, eight assists, five boards and a steal. Accuracy was the All-Star point guard's biggest issue, as he could only manage a 3-for-13 tally from the field, including 1-for-5 from behind the arc. DeMarre Carroll registered eight points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal, while rookie Pascal Siakam went for four points, nine boards and a steal over 22 minutes.

Detroit next takes on the Magic in their home opener on Friday, while Toronto remains home for an Eastern Conference Finals re-match with the Cavaliers on Friday as well.

												The host Memphis Grizzlies took down the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves, 102-98, in their season opener Wednesday.

Minnesota quickly jumped out to a 20-3 lead to begin the game, leaving Memphis in a tight spot almost immediately.  The Grizzlies answered with a lightning-fast run of their own, however, and managed to exit the first quarter trailing by only three points. While reigning Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns scored nine points in the first five minutes of the contest, the Grizzlies were able to keep him relatively quiet during the second and third quarters.  Towns still finished with a respectable 21 points.  Veteran center Marc Gasol, who Towns has called his toughest matchup, made this no easy feat, however, recording four blocks to go along with 18 points.  Two other members of Memphis's longstanding core, Mike Conley and Zach Randolph, also contributed heavily in the points column, scoring 24 and 19 respectively.

While Memphis's veterans drove the win, Minnesota saw major contributions from their younger players.  Third-year wing Andrew Wiggins led the team in scoring, posting 25 points, while high-flying young guard Zach LaVine dropped in 19.  Towns, meanwhile, added five assists and four rebounds to complement his scoring output.  The contest was also the NBA debut for rookie Kris Dunn, the fifth overall pick in the 2016 draft. Dunn played behind LaVine and Ricky Rubio, clocking just 15 minutes of game time.  He contributed eight points and four rebounds during that time on the floor.

The Wolves will visit Sacramento on Saturday, while Memphis will take to the road to face the Knicks.

												The Denver Nuggets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 107-102, in their season opener Wednesday at Smoothie King Center. 

After holding a 12-point lead at halftime and a 10-point lead headed into the final quarter, the Nuggets (1-0) were able to hold off a surging Pelicans (0-1) team that got the game to within two points with just over two minutes remaining. Denver point guard Emanuel Mudiay scored the final five points for the Nuggets as they were able to play spoiler on New Orleans All-Star Anthony Davis' career night. 

Davis filled up every single category on the stat sheet, recording 50 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, seven steals and four blocks over 41 minutes in what was an unbelievable way to start the season for the big man. Davis scored nearly half of his team points and outscored the rest of the starting lineup by 21 points, as he single-handedly kept the Pelicans in the game. New Orleans' next highest scorer was starting point guard Time Frazier, who managed 15 points on top of 11 assists in 37 minutes. E'Twaun Moore, who scored 10, was the only other player in double figures for the Pelicans.

For Denver, Jusuf Nurkic led the way with a team-high 23 points on an efficient 9-of-13 shooting from the field on top of nine rebounds.  Starting shooting guard Will Barton wasn't far behind, scoring 22 points of his own in 35 minutes. Mudiay struggled in the debut of his sophomore season, shooting just 2-of-8 from the field for 11 points on top of managing just three assists. In the end, the game was won on the glass, as the Nuggets managed to out-rebound the Pelicans 58-34 on the night. 

The Nuggets will head home Saturday to take on the Trail Blazers, while the Pelicans will stay at home Friday and go up against the Warriors.

												The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 103-97, in their season opener Wednesday at Wells Fargo Arena. 

The Thunder (1-0) came into the game as heavy favorites against a 76ers (0-1) team that was debuting some of its new, young talent. Philadelphia pushed the opposition to the final seconds of the game and even entered the fourth quarter with a six-point lead and plenty of confidence, but Russell Westbrook would ultimately play spoiler, scoring 12 of his game-high 32 points in the final period and helping the Thunder win the fourth quarter by a comfortable 12 points. On top of his scoring, Westbrook managed to add on 12 rebounds and nine assists over his 36 minutes of playing time. Steven Adams played 36 minutes right alongside Westbrook, scoring 16 points but grabbing just five rebounds in that span. Enes Kanter provided some quality minutes off the bench, scoring 17 points, eight of which came in the fourth quarter, and grabbing 12 rebounds himself. 

For the 76ers, all eyes were on big man Joel Embiid as he made his regular season debut as a member of the team and he did not disappoint, scoring a team-high 20 points, grabbing seven rebounds and blocking a pair of shots in just 22 minutes. Embiid displayed an array of post moves and even managed to show off a smooth midrange stroke. Nik Stauskas, who came close to being cut before the season started, provided a huge jolt of life off the bench Wednesday, shooting 5-of-6 from the field en route to 13 points in 23 minutes. As a team, the 76ers were ultimately done in by their lack of 3-point shooting, hitting just 7-of-24 shots on the night.

The Thunder will return to action on Friday when they take on the Suns, while the 76ers will remain at home Saturday when they matchup with the Hawks.

												The Sacramento Kings defeated the host Phoenix Suns, 113-94, at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Wednesday. 

Sacramento (1-0) built off an early first quarter lead and never had to look back, as they were aided by efficient scoring from both the starters and the bench. Ty Lawson started in place of Darren Collison (suspension), and will continue to shoulder the starting point guard minutes according to coach David Joerger. Lawson logged 36 minutes. Although Lawson proved to be one of the few Kings scorers to finish below 50 percent from the field, his seven assists led all players. DeMarcus Cousins picked up where he left off last season, dominated the paint and often found his way to the free throw line, as the all-star big man finished with 24 points and six rebounds on 6-of-10 shooting (12-of-16 FT). The Kings were aided by a strong bench performance, led by newly acquired Matt Barnes (14 points on 6-of-9 shooting in 28 minutes) and Garrett Temple (12 points on 6-of-8 shooting in 18 minutes). 

Phoenix (0-1) was relatively quiet when it came to offseason acquisitions, however multiple narratives surrounding rookie players Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss, in addition to Devin Booker's strong second half of last season carried into the opener. The two rookies came off the bench and combined for 17 points and six rebounds in 34 minutes of action, while Devin Booker took until the second half to get hot. Booker ended up with 18 points, three assists and two rebounds on 8-of-12 shooting. The Suns were outpaced by the Kings and had trouble finding efficient shooting on the perimeter, evidenced by the 25 percent effort as a unit. 

The Kings head home on a back-to-back by welcoming the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday, while head to Oklahoma City to face the Thunder on Friday.

												The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Houston Rockets, 120-114, at Staples Center on Wednesday. 

The Lakers (1-0) brought in Luke Walton as their new head coach for the 2016-2017 season, and the new offense that involved an expected volume shooting from the perimeter, was effective enough to aid Los Angeles to a good start. The Lakers took 35 shots from behind the arc and sank 12 of them, and the 34.3 percent efficiency was enough to constantly keep Los Angeles within striking distance. The Rockets led for most of the game, but never by a controlling amount. Jordan Clarkson drained a 29 foot three-pointer with 1:47 left in the fourth quarter to take 116-112 lead, and followed Nene's banker with a quick two pointer to hold the lead at four points. D'Angelo Russell's sloppy turnover with seconds left gave the Rockets a bit of life, but they were unable to capitalize and the Lakers ran out the clock. 

James Harden was named point guard, and although his usage percentage was point guard-esque last season, the official designation was backed up by 17 assists. Harden made use of quick passes in transition and threaded the needle time and time again in the first half. The Rockets star player added 34 points and eight rebounds to his strong start to the season. Newly acquired Eric Gordon (19 points on 7-of-15 shooting) and Ryan Anderson (14 points on 6-of-15 shooting) were effective in the Harden led system. Clint Capela wasted no time taking Dwight Howard's spot under center with 16 points and nine boards in 26 minutes. 

Both teams hit the road on Friday, as the Rockets visit the Dallas Mavericks, while the Lakers visit the Utah Jazz.

												The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting New York Knicks, 117-88 , at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday.

The new-look Knicks (0-1), who added Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee in a makeover of their starting five this offseason, had their moments at various points until the middle of the third quarter, at which point LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and rest of the defending NBA champions started to exert their dominance. New York's comeback efforts were ultimately undermined by a collectively poor shooting night, vulnerability down in the paint despite the presence of Noah and standout second-year forward Kristaps Porzingis, and carelessness with the ball. New York managed just 36.8 percent shooting from the field, was out-rebounded on the defensive glass by a 40-29 margin, was outscored 52-28 in the paint, and allowed 21 points to the Cavs off 18 turnovers, all pivotal factors in a 29-point defeat.

New York was led by Carmelo Anthony, who played only 30 minutes in the blowout but managed 19 points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal. Rose put together a 17-point effort in his Knicks debut after missing most of the preseason, but could only supplement the scoring with three rebounds, an assist and a block. Porzingis was solid with 16 points, seven rebounds, a steal and a pair of rejections, with more than half his scoring coming on three made three-pointers on five attempts. However, Noah and Lee were shut out on the scoreboard altogether, with the former making up somewhat for his lack of points with six boards, three assists and a steal in a modest 20 minutes.

The decisive second-half lead the Cavs (1-0) eventually built up allowed their two biggest superstars to finish the last several minutes on the bench. Irving, often matched up against a rusty Derrick Rose, paced the Cavs with 29 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals. James posted a triple-double, totaling 19 points, 14 assists, 11 rebounds and a block in just 32 minutes. Kevin Love contributed a double-double with 23 points, 12 boards, a pair of assists and a trio of steals. The recently re-signed J.R. Smith supplied eight points on 3-for-13 shooting against his former Knicks teammates.

The Knicks head back to New York for their home opener against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night. The Cavaliers hit the road for the first time this season to take on the Toronto Raptors on Friday evening.

												The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the visiting Utah Jazz, 113-104, in the first game of the season on Tuesday.

The game became a back-and-forth battle in the second half, with Utah establishing a lead that was quickly reclaimed by the Blazers in the fourth quarter.  The emerging dynamic duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum helped pave the way for Portland's high-octane offensive outing, combining for 64 points, including 39 for Lillard.  The pair helped facilitate a perimeter attack for the Blazers, as they contributed six of the team's 13 three-point makes.  Portland also received a boost off the bench from recently re-signed wing Allen Crabbe, who provided 18 points and four more shots from behind the arc.

Utah, meanwhile, is struggling to remain healthy despite the season having barely begun.  Star forwards Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors were sidelined with injuries, as well as bench guard Alec Burks.  Utah's offense was able to fill the void, however, with significant contributions coming from newly-acquired veteran Joe Johnson (29 points, 12-16 shooting) and sophomore Rodney Hood (26 points, two steals).  It was the defensive end where Utah ultimately came up short, as the Blazers were allowed to convert on 52 percent of their field goal attempts.

The Blazers will face the Clippers in Portland on Wednesday, while the Jazz will see the Lakers on Thursday.

												The San Antonio Spurs blew out the host Golden State Warriors, 129-100, on Tuesday night at Oracle Arena. 

Some wondered if the Warriors (0-1) could possibly go undefeated with this superstar team, but that notion ended on opening night. The Spurs (1-0) controlled from start to finish, as they won all four quarters and led by double-digits for the majority of the game. In addition, they outrebounded the Warriors 54-35 in their dominating win. Bench production was huge as well, as the Spurs dropped 54 bench points, while holding Golden State to just 16 points off their pine. 

Kawhi Leonard was the star, as he scored a career-high 35 points, while going 15-for-15 from the free-throw line. He also provided defense in the victory, as he grabbed five rebounds and took away five steals. LaMarcus Aldridge contributed 26 points and 14 rebounds of his own. The three other starters combined for just 14 points, while Jonathon Simmons was third on the team with 20 points off the bench. 

This was Kevin Durant's first game in a Golden State uniform and he didn’t disappoint, as he collected 27 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and a pair of blocks and steals in the defeat. Stephen Curry wasn’t shabby either, as he provided 26 points and four assists of his own. Draymond Green stuffed the stat sheet once again, tallying 18 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and five steals in the loss. Other than Klay Thompson's 11 points, not one of the other nine Warriors who played scored more than five points. 

Golden State is off until Friday, when they travel to play the New Orleans Pelicans. The Spurs play again on Thursday, as they face the host Sacramento Kings.
